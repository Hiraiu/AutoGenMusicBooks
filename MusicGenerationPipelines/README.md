# Music Generation from Text Descriptions

## Overview
This Python project generates music based on text descriptions using a combination of natural language processing and audio synthesis technologies. 
It utilizes two models: MusicGen and MusicLDM from the `transformers` to create music snippets that reflect the mood and content of the input text.

## Features
- Text-to-music generation using pre-trained models.
- Flexible input options to specify text sources and musical styles.
- Output management to organize generated music files effectively.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `transformers`, `nltk`, `ebooklib`, `BeautifulSoup`, `scipy`, `torch`

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
