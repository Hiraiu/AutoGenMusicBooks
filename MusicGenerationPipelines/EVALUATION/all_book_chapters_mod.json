        "The principles of insurance, they tell us, were\nnot hidden from our Anglo-Saxon forefathers.\nHow anybody had the enterprise in\nthose rough-and-tumble days to guarantee a client\nagainst \u201cfire, water, robbery or other calamity\u201d\nremains a problem for the historian; the more so as it\nappears that mathematical calculations were first\napplied to the business by the eminent John de Witt.\nIn our own time, at any rate, the insurance\ncompanies have woven a golden net under the tight-rope\nwalk of existence; if life is a lottery, the prudent\ncitizen faces it with the consciousness that he is backed\nboth ways. Had the idea been thoroughly grasped in\nthose remoter periods, no doubt but Alfred\u2019s hostess\nwould have been easily consoled for the damage done\nto her cakes and King John handsomely compensated\nfor all that he lost in The Wash. Let us thank\nthe soaring genius of the human mind which has thus\nfound a means to canalize for us the waters of\naffliction; and let us always be scrupulous in paying up\nour premiums before the date indicated on the\nprinted card, lest calamity should come upon us and\nfind us unprepared.",
        "I have already mentioned that the Indescribable\nkept its own tame doctor, a man at the very\nhead of his profession. He was not in the least\nnecessary to it; that is to say, a far cheaper man\nwould have done the work equally well. But it suited\nthe style of the Indescribable to have the very best\nman, and to advertise the fact that he had given up\nhis practice in order to work exclusively for the\ncompany; it was all of a piece with the huge white\nbuilding, and the frieze, and the palms in the\nwaiting-room. It looked well. For a quite different reason the\nIndescribable retained its own private detective. This\nfact was not advertised; nor was he ever referred to\nin the official communications of the company except\nas \u201cour representative.\u201d He carried neither a lens nor\na forceps\u2014not even a revolver; he took no\ninjections; he had no stupid confidential friend; but a\nprivate detective he was for all that. An amateur\ndetective I will not call him, for the company paid him,\nand as you would expect, quite handsomely; but he\nhad nothing whatever to do with Scotland Yard,\nwhere the umbrellas go to.",
        "By next morning Bredon\u2019s spirits had risen.\nHe had received by the early post a\nconfidential letter from the company describing\nMr. Mottram\u2019s curious offer, and suggesting\n(naturally) that the state of his health made suicide a\nplausible conjecture. The morning was fine, the car\nrunning well, the road they had selected in admirable\ncondition. It was still before tea time when they\nturned off from its excellent surface onto indifferent\nby-roads, through which they had to thread their\nway with difficulty. The signposts, as is the wont of\nEnglish signposts, now blazoned \u201cChilthorpe,\u201d\n\u201cChilthorpe,\u201d \u201cChilthorpe,\u201d as if it were the\nlodestone of the neighbourhood, now passed it over in\nsevere silence, preferring to call attention to the\nfact that you were within five furlongs of Little\nStubley. They had fallen, besides, upon hill\ncountry, with unexpected turns and precipitous gradients;\nthey followed with enforced windings the bleak\nvalley of the Busk, which swirled beneath them over\nsmooth boulders between desolate banks. It was\njust after they had refused the fifth invitation to\nLittle Stubley that the County Council\u2019s\narrangements played them false; there was a clear issue\nbetween two rival roads, with no trace of a\nsignpost to direct their preference. It was here that they\nsaw, and hailed, an old gentleman who was making\ncasts into a promising pool about twenty yards away.",
        "They did not escape another dose of Mrs.\nDavis, who appeared soon afterward to\nannounce that the big room upstairs was ready\nfor them, and would they step up and mind their\nheads please, the stairs were that low. It was indeed\na rambling sort of house, on three or four different\nlevels, as country inns are wont to be; it did not\nseem possible to reach any one room from any other\nwithout going down and up again or up and down\nagain. At the head of the stairs Mrs. Davis turned\ndramatically and pointed to a door marked \u201c5\u201d. \u201cIn\nthere!\u201d she said, the complicated emotion in her\nvoice plainly indicating what was in there. To her\nobvious confusion the door opened as she spoke, and\na little, dark man, whom they guessed then and\nknew afterward to be the secretary, came out into\nthe passage. He was followed by a policeman\u2014no\ningenuity could have doubted the fact\u2014in plain\nclothes. Bredon\u2019s investigations were ordinarily made\nindependently of, and for the most part unknown to,\nthe official champions of justice. But on this\noccasion Fate had played into his hands. \u201cBy Gad!\u201d\nhe cried, \u201cit\u2019s Leyland!",
        "Mrs. Davis\u2019s cuisine, if it did not quite\njustify all the ironic comments of the old\ngentleman, lent some colour to them. With\nthe adjectival trick of her class she always\nunderestimated quantity, referring to a large tureen as\n\u201ca drop of soup,\u201d and overestimated quality, daily\nsuggesting for her guests\u2019 supper \u201ca nice chop.\u201d\nThe chop always appeared; the nice chop (as the old\ngentleman pointed out) would have been a pleasant\nchange. As surely as you had eggs and bacon for\nbreakfast, so surely you had a chop for supper;\n\u201cand some nice fruit to follow\u201d heralded the entrance\nof a depressed blanc-mange (which Mrs. Davis\ncalled \u201cshape,\u201d after its principal attribute) and\nsome cold green-gages. These must have come from\nAlcinous\u2019s garden, for at no time of the year were\nthey out of season. If Angela had stayed in the house\nfor a fortnight, it is possible that she would have\ntaken Mrs. Davis in hand and inspired her with\nlarger ideas, As it was, she submitted, feeling that\na suicide in the house was sufficiently unsettling for\nMrs. Davis without further upheavals.",
        "On their return to their coffee room they found\nMr. Pulteney in sole possession, He was\nsolemnly filling in a cross-word puzzle in a\ndaily newspaper about three weeks old. Leyland had\ngone off to the bar parlour, intent on picking up the\ngossip of the village. Bredon excused himself and\nwent upstairs to find that Angela was not yet\nthinking of bed, she had only got tired of a cross-word\npuzzle. \u201cWell,\u201d she asked, \u201cand what do you make\nof Mr. Brinkman?\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s a bit deep. I think he knows just\na little more about all this than he says. However,\nI let him talk, and did my best to make him think\nI was a fool.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just what I\u2019ve been doing with Mr.\nPulteney. At least, I\u2019ve been playing the ing\u00e9nue. I\nthought I was going to get him to call me \u2018My\ndear young lady\u2019\u2014I love that; he very nearly did\nonce or twice.\u201d \u201cDid you find him deep?\u201d \u201cNot in that way. Miles, I forbid you to suspect\nMr. Pulteney; he\u2019s my favourite man. He told me\nthat suicide generally followed, instead of\npreceding, the arrival of young ladies. I giggled.\u201d \u201cI wish he\u2019d drown himself. He\u2019s one too many in\nthis darned place. And it\u2019s all confusing enough\nwithout him.\u201d \u201cWant me to put in some Watson work?\u201d \u201cIf you aren\u2019t wanting to go to bed.\u201d Watson\nwork meant that Angela tried to suggest new ideas\nto her husband under a mask of carefully assumed\nstupidity. \u201cYou see, I\u2019m all for suicide. My instincts\ntell me that it\u2019s suicide. I can smell it in the air.\u201d \u201cI only smelt acetylene. Why suicide\nparticularly?\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s the locked door. I\u2019ve still got to see\nthe Boots and verify Brinkman\u2019s facts; but a door\nlocked on the inside, with barred windows, makes\nnonsense of Leyland\u2019s idea.\u201d \u201cBut a murderer might want to lock the door,\nso as to give himself time to escape.\u201d \u201cExactly; but he\u2019d lock it on the outside. On\nthe other hand, a locked door looks like suicide,\nbecause, unless Brinkman is lying, Mottram didn\u2019t\nlock his door as a rule; and the Boots had orders\nto go into the room with shaving-water that\nmorning.\u201d \u201cWhy the Boots? Why not the maid?\u201d \u201cAngela, don\u2019t be so painfully modern! Maid\nservants at country hotels don\u2019t. They leave some\ntepid water on the mat, make a gentle rustling noise\nat the door, and tiptoe away. No, I\u2019m sure he locked\nthe door for fear Brinkman should come in in the\nmiddle\u2014or Pulteney, of course, might have come\nto the wrong door by mistake. He wanted to be left\nundisturbed.\u201d \u201cBut not necessarily in order to commit suicide.\u201d \u201cYou mean he might have fallen asleep over\nsomething else he was doing? Writing a letter for\nexample, to the Pullford Examiner? But in that case\nhe wouldn\u2019t have been in bed. You can\u2019t gas\nyourself by accident except in your sleep. Then there\u2019s\nanother thing\u2014the Bertillon mark on the gas-tap.\nLeyland is smart enough to know the difference\nbetween the mark you leave when you turn it on\nand the mark you leave when you turn it off. But\nhe won\u2019t follow out his own conclusions. If Mottram\nhad gone to bed in the ordinary way, as he must\nhave in the event of foul play or accident, we should\nhave seen where he turned it off as well as where he\nturned it on. The point is, Mottram didn\u2019t turn the\nlight on at all. He went to bed in the half-darkness,\ntook his sleeping draught, and turned on the gas.\u201d \u201cBut, angel pet, how could he write a long letter\nto the Pullford paper in the half-darkness? And how\ndid he read his shocker in the half-darkness? Let\u2019s\nbe just to poor Mr. Leyland, though he is in the\nforce.\u201d \u201cI was coming on to that. Meanwhile, I say he\ndidn\u2019t light the gas. Because if you want to light\nthe gas you have to do it in two places, and the\nmatch he used, the only match we found in the\nroom, had hardly burned for a second.\u201d \u201cThen why did he strike a match at all?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming to that too. Finally, there\u2019s the\nquestion of the taps. A murderer would want to make\ncertain of doing his work quickly, therefore he\nwould make sure that the gas was pouring out of\nboth jets, the one on the bracket on the wall and\nthe one on the standard lamp by the window. The\nsuicide, if he means to die in his sleep, isn\u2019t in a\nhurry to go off. On the contrary, he wants to make\nsure that his sleeping draught takes effect before\nthe gas fumes become objectionable. So he turns on\nonly one of the two jets, and that is the one farthest\naway from him. Isn\u2019t that all right?\u201d \u201cYou are ingenious, you know, Miles,\noccasionally. I\u2019m always so afraid that one day you\u2019ll find\nme out. Now let\u2019s hear about all the things you\nwere just coming to.\u201d \u201cWell, you see, it isn\u2019t a simple case of suicide.\nWhy should it be? People who have taken out a\nEuthanasia policy don\u2019t want Tom, Dick and Harry\nto know\u2014more particularly, they don\u2019t want Miles\nBredon to know\u2014that they have committed suicide.\nThey have the habit, as I know from experience, of\ntrying to put up a little problem in detection for\nme, the brutes!\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be angry with them, Miles. After\nall, if they didn\u2019t the Indescribable might sack you,\nand then where would Francis\u2019s new tam-o\u2019-shanter\ncome from?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt, woman! This is a case of suicide\nwith complications, and dashed ingenious ones. In\nthe first place, we noticed that entry in the visitors\u2019\nbook. That\u2019s an attempt to make it look as if he\nexpected a long stay here, before he went to bed.\nActually, through not studying the habits of the\nWilkinsons, he overshot himself there\u2014a little too\ningenious. We know that when he did that he was\nsimply trying to lead us up the garden; but we\nwere too clever for him.\u201d \u201cLet me merely mention the fact that it was I\nwho spotted that entry. But pray proceed.\u201d \u201cThen he did two quite irreconcilable things:\nhe took a sleeping draught and he asked to be called\nearly. Now, a man who\u2019s on a holiday, and is afraid\nhe won\u2019t sleep, doesn\u2019t make arrangements to be\ncalled early in the morning. We know that he took\nthe sleeping draught so as to die painlessly; and as\nfor being called early in the morning it was probably\nso as to give the impression that his death was quite\nunpremeditated. He took several other precautions\nfor the same reason.\u201d \u201cSuch as?\u201d \u201cHe wound up his watch. Leyland noticed that,\nbut he didn\u2019t notice that it was an eight-day watch.\nA methodical person winds up his eight-day watch\non Sunday; once more, Mottram was a tiny bit too\ningenious. Then he put the studs out ready in his\nshirt. Very few people when they\u2019re on holiday take\nthe trouble to do that. Mottram did because he\nwanted us to think that he meant to get up the\nnext morning in the ordinary way.\u201d \u201cAnd the next article?\u201d \u201cThe window. A murderer, not taking any risks,\nwould shut the window, or see that it was shut,\nbefore he turned the gas on. A man going to bed in\nthe ordinary way would either shut it completely or\nelse open it to its full extent, where the hasp catches,\nso that in either case it shouldn\u2019t bang during the\nnight. Mottram left his window ajar, not enough\nopen to let the gas escape much. But he knew that\nin the morning the door would have to be knocked\nin, and with that sudden rush of air the window\nwould swing open. Which is exactly what happened.\u201d \u201cI believe he wrote and told you about all this\nbeforehand.\u201d \u201cSilence, woman! He left a shocker by his\nbedside, to make us think that he went to bed at peace\nwith all the world. In real life, if you take a dose\nyou don\u2019t read yourself to sleep as well. Besides, if\nhe had been wanting to read in bed he would have\nbrought the standard lamp over to his bedside so as\nto put it out last thing. Further, he had a letter\nready written, or rather half-written, which he left\non the blotting-pad. But he hadn\u2019t written it there\u2014he\nwrote it downstairs. I found the place where he\nhad blotted it on the pad in the dining-room.\nAnother deliberate effort to suggest that he had gone\nto sleep peacefully, leaving a job half-finished. And\nthen, of course, there was the match.\u201d \u201cYou mean he only struck it to give the\nimpression that he\u2019d lit the gas, but didn\u2019t really light it?\nI\u2019m getting the hang of the thing, aren\u2019t I? By the\nway, he couldn\u2019t have lit another match and thrown\nit out of the window?\u201d \u201cVery unlikely. Only smokers, and tidy ones at\nthat, throw matches out of the window. He either\nhad one match left in his pocket or borrowed one\nfrom Brinkman. But he didn\u2019t use it; suicides like\nthe dark. There\u2019s one other tiny point\u2014you see\nthat?\u201d He took up a large, cheap Bible which stood\nat the bedside of their own room. \u201cThere\u2019s a society\nwhich provides those, and of course there\u2019s one for\neach room. Mottram had taken his away from the\nbedside and put it in a drawer. It\u2019s funny how\nsuperstitious we men are, when all\u2019s said and done.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a tiny bit grooly, isn\u2019t it? Well, when are\nyou going to dig the grave at the crossroads and\nborrow a stake from the local carpenter?\u201d \u201cWell, you see, there\u2019s just that trifling difficulty\nabout the tap being turned off. Leyland is right in\nsaying that dead men don\u2019t do that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Brinky\u2019s explanation?\u201d \u201cMr. Brinkman, to whom you were only\nintroduced three hours ago, thinks the doctor turned it\noff accidentally in the morning. That\u2019s nonsense, of\ncourse. His idea was that the tap was very loose,\nbut it wasn\u2019t, really\u2014Leyland had it loosened on\npurpose, so as to be able to turn it without\nobliterating the finger-marks. If it hadn\u2019t been stiff, of course,\nthere\u2019d have been no marks left at all. So there\u2019s a\nthree-pipe problem for you, my dear Mrs. Hudson.\u201d Angela\u2019s forehead wrinkled becomingly. \u201cTwo\nproblems, my poor old Lestrade. How did the tap\nget turned off, and why does Brinky want us to\nthink it got turned off accidental? I always like you\nto have plenty of theories, because it keeps your\nmind active; but with my well-known womanly\nintuition I should say it was a plain issue between the\nlocked door, which means suicide, and the\nturned-off tap, which means murder. Did I hear you putting\na fiver on it with Leyland?\u201d \u201cYou did. There\u2019s dashed little you don\u2019t hear.\u201d \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve got a fiver on it, of course it\u2019s\ngot to be suicide. That\u2019s a good, wifely point of\nview, isn\u2019t it? I wish it were the other way round;\nI believe I could account for that door if I were\nput to it. But I won\u2019t; I wonder how Leyland\u2019s\ngetting on?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s worse off than we are, because he\u2019s got\nto get over the door trouble, and he\u2019s got to find a\nmotive for the murder and a criminal to convict of\nit. We score there; if it\u2019s suicide, there can be no\ntwo theories about the criminal! And we know the\nmotive\u2014partly, anyhow. Mottram did it in order to\nmake certain of that half-million for his legatees.\nAnd we shall soon know who they are. The only\nmotive that worries me is Brinkman\u2019s: Why\u2019s he\nso keen on its being suicide? Perhaps the will would\nmake that clear too.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I can\u2019t work it out at\npresent.\u201d He began to stride up and down the room.\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly certain about that door. It\u2019s\nimpossible that it should be a spring-lock, in an\nold-fashioned hotel like this.\u201d He went up to the door\nof their room, and bent down to examine it. Then,\nwith startling suddenness, he turned the handle and\nthrew it open. \u201cAngela, come here.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You see\nthat picture in the passage? There\u2019s no wind to make\nit swing like that, is there?\u201d \u201cYou mean you think somebody\u2019s been\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cJust as I bent down to the door, I could have\nsworn I heard footsteps going softly away. It must\nhave been somebody actually at the keyhole.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run out?\u201d \u201cWell, it makes it so dashed awkward to find\nsomebody listening and catch them at it. In some\nways it\u2019s much better to know that somebody has\nbeen listening and for them not to know whether you\nknow or not. It\u2019s confoundedly awkward, all the\nsame.\u201d \u201cIdiotic of us not to have remembered that we\nwere in a country pub, and that servants in country\npubs still do listen at keyholes.\u201d \u201cServants? Well, ye-es. But Pulteney\u2019s room is\nonly just round that corner.\u201d \u201cMiles, I will not have you talking of poor old\nEdward like that.\u201d \u201cWho told you his name was Edward?\u201d \u201cIt must be; you\u2019ve only to look at him.\nAnyhow, he will always be Edward to me. But he simply\ncouldn\u2019t listen at a keyhole. He would regard it\nas a somewhat unconventional proceeding\u201d (this\nwith a fair imitation of Mr. Pulteney\u2019s voice).\n\u201cBesides, he can\u2019t nearly have finished that cross-word\nyet. He\u2019s very stupid without me to help him; he\nwill always put down \u2018EMU\u2019 when there\u2019s a bird of\nthree letters.\u201d \u201cWell, anyhow, Brinkman\u2019s room is only up one\nflight of stairs. As you say, it may be the servants,\nor even Mrs. Davis herself; but I\u2019d like to feel sure\nof that. I wonder how much of what we said was\noverheard.\u201d \u201cWell, Miles dear, you ought to know. Don\u2019t you\nremember how you listened at the kitchen door in\nold Solomon\u2019s house, and thought you heard a man\u2019s\nvoice and found out afterward it was only the\nloud-speaker?\u201d \u201cGood God, why does one marry? Look here, I\u2019m\njust going to have a look around for old Leyland,\nand warn him that there\u2019s dirty work at the\ncrossroads.\u201d \u201cYes, he must be careful not to soliloquize too\nmuch.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s time you went to bed; I\nwon\u2019t be more than half an hour or so.\u201d \u201cNot beyond closing time, in other words? Gosh,\nwhat a man! Well, walk quietly, and don\u2019t wake\nEdward.\u201d Bredon found Leyland still in the bar parlour,\nlistening patiently to the interminable theorizings\nof the oldest inhabitant. \u201cThat\u2019s how it was, you see.\nTried to turn off the gars, and didn\u2019t turn it off\nproper, that\u2019s what he did. He didn\u2019t think to lay\nhands on himself, stands to reason he didn\u2019t. What\nfor should he, and him so rich and all? Mark you,\nI\u2019ve known Mottram when he wasn\u2019t no higher than\nthat chair yonder, not so much he wasn\u2019t; and I\nknow what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ve seen suicides\nput away too, I have; I recollect poor Johnny Pillock\nup at the toll-house; went mad he did, and hung\nhimself off of a tree the same as if it might be from\nthe ceiling yonder. Ah! There wasn\u2019t no gars in\nthem days. Good-night, Mr. Warren, and pleasant\ndreams to you; you mind them stairs in your front\ngarden. Yes, powerful rich Mottram he was,\u201d and\nso on without cessation or remorse. It was nearly\nclosing time before Bredon managed to drag the\npoliceman away and warn him that there were others\n(it appeared) besides themselves who were\ninterested in the secret of the upstairs room.",
        "\u201cNow that I have put that fiver on with\nBredon, I begin to doubt my own\nconclusions. That is the extraordinary effect of\nhaving a \u2018will to believe.\u2019 As long as you have no\nprejudices in the case, no brief to maintain, you can\nform a theory and feel that it is a mathematical\ncertainty. Directly you have a reason for wanting to\nbelieve the thing true that same theory begins to\nlook as if it had all sorts of holes in it. Or rather,\nthe whole theory seems fantastic\u2014you have been\nbasing too much on insufficient evidence. Yesterday\nI was as certain that the case was one of murder\nas I am certain of my own existence. To-day I am\ndeveloping scruples. Let me get it all down on paper,\nanyhow; and I shall be able to shew my working\n  to Bredon afterward, however the case turns out. \u201cThere is one indication which is absolutely vital,\nabsolutely essential: that is the turning off of the\ntap. That is the pinpoint of truth upon which any\ntheory must rest. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy to explain\nthe action; but it is an action, and the action\ndemands an agent. The fact that the gas was tampered\nwith would convince me of foul play, even if there\nwere no other direct indications. There are such\nindications. \u201cIn the first place, the window: If the window\nhad stood all night as it was found in the morning,\nwide open and held by its clasp, there could have\nbeen no death. Pulteney tells me that there was a\nstrong east wind blowing most of the night, and\nyou can trust a fisherman to be accurate in these\nmatters. The window, then, like the gas, had been\ndeliberately arranged in an artificial position\nbetween Mottram\u2019s death and the arrival of the rescue\nparty. If the death had been accidental, the window\nwould have been shut and remained shut all night.\nYou do not leave a window half open, with nothing\nto fix it, on a windy night. If it had been a case of\nsuicide, it is equally clear that the window would\nhave remained shut all night. If you are proposing\nto gas yourself you do not take risks of the window\nblowing open and leaving you half-asphyxiated.\nThere is only one explanation of the open window,\nas there is of the gas-tap: and that explanation\ninvolves the interference of a person or persons\nunknown. \u201cAnother direct indication is the match found in\nthe grate. Bredon\u2019s suggestion that this match was\nused by the maid earlier in the evening is quite\nimpossible; there was a box on the mantelpiece, which\nwould be plainly visible in daylight, and it was not\none of those matches that was used. It was a smaller\nmatch, of a painfully ordinary kind; Brinkman uses\nsuch matches, and Pulteney, and probably every\nsmoker within miles around. Now, the match was\nnot used to light the gas. It would have been\nnecessary to light the gas in two places, and the match\nwould have burned some little way down the stem,\nwhereas this one was put out almost as soon as it\nwas lit. It must have been used, I think, to light\nthe gas in the passage outside, but of this I cannot\nbe sure. It was thrown carelessly into the grate\nbecause, no doubt, the nocturnal visitor assumed as a\nmatter of course that others like it would already\nhave been thrown into the grate. As a matter of fact,\nMottram must have thrown the match he lit the\ngas with out of the window: I have not found it. \u201cFrom various indications, it is fairly clear that\nMottram did not foresee his end. Chief among these\nis the order which he gave that he was to be woken\nearly in the morning. This might of course be bluff;\nbut if so it was a very heartless kind of bluff, for\nit involved the disturbing of the whole household\nwith the tragic news in the small hours, instead of\nleaving it to transpire after breakfast. And this\nleads us on to another point, which Bredon appears\nto have overlooked: A man who wants to be woken\nup early in the morning does not take a sleeping\ndraught overnight. It follows that Mottram did not\nreally take the sleeping draught. And that means\nthat the glass containing it was deliberately put by\nhis bed to act as a blind. The medical evidence is\nnot positive as to whether he actually took the stuff\nor not. My conjecture is, then, that the man who\ncame in during the night\u2014twice during the night\u2014put\na glass with the remains of a sleeping draught\nby the bed in order to create the impression that\nMottram had committed suicide. \u201cWhen I struck upon this idea, it threw a flood\nof light on various other details of the case. We\nhave to deal with a murderer who is anxious to\ncreate the impression that the victim has died by\nhis own hand. It was for this reason that he left\na half-finished letter of Mottram\u2019s on the\ntable\u2014a letter which Mottram had actually written\ndownstairs; this would look like the regular suicide\u2019s\ndodge of trying to cover up his tracks by leaving a\nhalf-finished document about. It would make a mind\nlike Bredon\u2019s suspect suicide at once. The same may\nbe said of the ridiculous care with which the dead\nman was supposed to have wound up an eight-day\nwatch before retiring; it was a piece of bluff which\nin itself would deceive nobody; but here it was\ndouble bluff, and I expect it has deceived Bredon.\nHe will see everywhere the marks of a suicide\ncovering up his tracks, which is exactly what the\nmurderer meant him to see. \u201cThe thing begins to take shape in my mind, then,\nas follows: When he feels confident that his victim\nis asleep the murderer tiptoes into the room, puts\ndown the glass by the bedside and the letter on the\ntable; winds up the watch (a very silent one); then\ngoes over to the gas, wipes off with a rag the mark\nof Mottram\u2019s hand turning it off, and then, with\nthe same rag, gently turns it on once more. The\nwindow is already shut. He tiptoes through the\ndoorway, and waits for an hour or two till the gas has\ndone its deadly work. Then, for some reason, he\nreturns; for what reason, I cannot at present\ndetermine. Once he had taken all these precautions,\nit must have looked to him as if a verdict of suicide\nwas a foregone conclusion. But it is a trick of the\nmurderer\u2014due, some think, to the workings of a\nguilty conscience\u2014to revisit the scene of his crime\nand spoil the whole effect of it. It is this reason,\nof course, that I must find out before I am certain\nof my case; leaving aside all further questions as\nto the murderer\u2019s identity and his motives. \u201cIn fact, there are two problems: a problem of\nwhy and a problem of how. Why did the murderer\nturn the gas off? And how did he leave the door\nlocked behind him? I suspect that the answer to the\nfirst question is, as I have said, merely\npsychological; it was some momentary instinct of bravado, or\nremorse, or sheer lunacy. The answer to the second\nquestion must be something more complicated. In\nthe abstract it is, I suppose, possible to turn a key\nin a lock from the wrong side by using a piece of\nwire or some instrument. But it is almost\ninconceivable that a man could do this without leaving\nscratches on the key; I have examined the key very\ncarefully and there are no scratches. Bredon, I can\nsee, hopes to arrive at some different conclusion\nabout the evidence; somebody, he thinks, is lying.\nBut Brinkman, and Ferrers the doctor, and the\nBoots, all rushed into the room at the same\nmoment. Ferrers is an honest man, and I am sure he\nis telling the truth when he says he found the gas\nturned off; and he went to it at once, before either\nof the others had time to interfere. It was the Boots\nwho found the key on the inside of the door, and\nthe Boots will not do for the murderer; a man with\none hand cannot have done conjuring tricks with\na lock. Brinkman\u2019s own evidence is perfectly\nstraightforward and consistent with that of the\nothers. He seems secretive, but that, I think, is the\nfellow\u2019s manner. I cannot at present see any motive\nwhich could have made him want to do away with\nMottram; the two seem to have been on intimate\nterms, and there is no evidence of a quarrel. \u201cI am inclined to exonerate Pulteney of all\nknowledge, even of all interest in the affair. He was a\ncomplete stranger to Mottram, so far as I can\ndiscover. But suspicion may equally well fall on\npeople outside the house; for, although the doors\nof the inn were locked, there is a practicable window\non the ground floor which is not always shut at\nnight. Mottram was known in Chilthorpe, and had\nlived there when he was young; there is the chance,\nthen, of a local vendetta. Pullford is only twenty\nmiles or so distant; and in Pullford he may easily\nhave had enemies; the letter from \u2018Brutus\u2019 shews\nthat. But, since the salient fact about Mottram was\nhis wealth, it seems obvious that the first question\nto be settled is that of his testamentary\ndispositions. I must telegraph to London to-morrow for full\ninformation about these, and pursue my local\ninquiries in the mean time. The only person on the\nspot who has any close tie of blood with the\ndeceased is the young fellow who owns the big shop\nhere. He is Mottram\u2019s nephew; Mottram himself\nstarted it long ago, and afterward made it over to\nhis sister and her husband, both of whom are now\ndead. Unfortunately for himself, the young man\nseems to have been something of a radical, and he\nmade an injudicious speech at a time when Mottram\nwas proposing to run himself as an independent\nParliamentary candidate for the constituency.\nThere was a quarrel; and Mrs. Davis thinks that\nthe two never met again. \u201cThese are only my first impressions. They may\nhave to be revised drastically as the case proceeds.\nBut of one thing I am confident\u2014there has been\nfoul play, and the effort to represent it as a case\nof suicide is necessarily doomed to failure.\u201d",
        "Angela and her husband breakfasted late\nnext morning. Leyland came in as they were\nfinishing, his manner full of excitement.\n\u201cMrs. Davis,\u201d he explained, \u201chas been talking to\nme.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be led on too much by that,\u201d said Angela.\n\u201cIt has happened to others.\u201d \u201cNo, but I mean, Mrs. Davis has been saying\nsomething.\u201d \u201cThat is far more unusual,\u201d assented Bredon.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear all about it. Angela\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cMrs. Bredon,\u201d said Angela firmly, \u201chas been\nassociated with me in many of my cases, and you\nmay speak freely in her presence. Cough it up,\nMr. Leyland; nothing is going to separate me from\nthis piece of toast.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing private about it\nparticularly. But I thought perhaps you might help. You\nsee, Mrs. Davis says that Mottram was expecting a\nvisitor to turn up in the morning and go out\nfishing with him.\u201d \u201cA mysterious stranger?\u201d suggested Angela.\n\u201cCarrying a blunt instrument?\u201d \u201cWell, no, as a matter of fact it was the Bishop\nof Pullford. Do you know Pullford at all?\u201d \u201cNothing is hidden from us, Mr. Leyland. They\nmake drain-pipes there, not perambulators, as some\nhave supposed. The parish church is a fine\nspecimen of early Perp. It has been the seat of a Roman\nCatholic Bishopric\u2014oh! I suppose that\u2019s the man?\u201d \u201cSo Mrs. Davis explained. A very genial man. Not\none of your standoffish ones. He was expected, it\nseems, by the first train, which gets in about ten.\nMottram left word that he was to be called early,\nbecause he wanted to get at the fishing, and the\nBishop, when he arrived, was to be asked to join\nMr. Mottram on the river; he would be at the Long\nPool. He\u2019d been down here before, apparently, as\nMottram\u2019s guest. Now, it\u2019s obvious that we had\nbetter find out what the Bishop has to say about\nall this. I\u2019d go myself only for one thing: I don\u2019t\nquite like leaving Chilthorpe while my suspicions\u201d\n(he dropped his voice) \u201care so undefined; and for\nanother thing, I\u2019ve telegraphed up to London for\ndetails about the will and I want to be certain that\nthe answer comes straight to my own hands. And\nthe inquest is at four this afternoon; I can\u2019t risk\nbeing late for that. I was wondering whether you\nand Mrs. Bredon would care to run over there?\nIt would take you less than an hour in the car, and\nif you went as representing the Indescribable it\nwould make it all rather less\u2014well, official. Then I\nthought perhaps at the end of the day we might\nswap information.\u201d \u201cWhat about it, Angy?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I shall come and see the Bishop.\nIt doesn\u2019t sound quite proper, somehow. But I\u2019ll\ndrive you into Pullford, and sit at the hotel for a\nbit and have luncheon there, and you can pick me\nup.\u201d \u201cAll right. I say, though,\u201d he added piteously,\n\u201cshall I have to go and change my suit?\u201d \u201cNot for a moment. You can explain to the Bishop\nthat your Sunday trousers are in pawn; if he\u2019s really\ngenial he\u2019ll appreciate that. Besides, that tweed suit\nmakes you look like a good-natured sort of ass; and\nthat\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it? After all, if you do\nstay to lunch, it will only be a bachelor party.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, we\u2019ll go. Just when I was\nbeginning to like Chilthorpe! Look here, Leyland, you\naren\u2019t expecting me to serve a summons on the\nBishop or clap the darbies on him, or anything?\nBecause if so you\u2019d better go yourself.\u201d \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t suspect the Bishop\u2014not\nparticularly, that is. I just want to know what he can tell\nus about Mottram\u2019s movements immediately before\nhis death, and what sort of man he was generally.\nHe may even know something about the will; but\nthere\u2019s no need to drag that topic in, because my\ntelegram ought to produce full information about\nthat. Thanks awfully. And we\u2019ll pool the day\u2019s\ninformation, eh?\u201d \u201cDone. I say, though, I think I\u2019d better just wire\nto the Bishop, to make sure that he\u2019s at home, and\nready to receive a stray spy. Then we can start\nat elevenish.\u201d As Bredon returned from sending the telegram, he\nwas waylaid, to his surprise, by Mr. Pulteney, who\nwas fooling about with rods and reels and things\nin the front hall. \u201cI wonder if I might make a\nsuggestion to you, Mr. Bredon,\u201d he said. \u201cI despise\nmyself for the weakness, but you know how it is.\nEvery man thinks in his heart that he would have\nmade a good detective. I ought to know better at\nmy age, but the foul fiend keeps urging me to point\nsomething out to you.\u201d Bredon smiled at the elaborate address. \u201cI should\nlike to hear it awfully,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all,\ndetection is only a mixture of common sense and special\nknowledge, so why shouldn\u2019t we all put something\ninto the pot?\u201d \u201cIt is special knowledge that is in question here;\notherwise I would not have ventured to approach\nyou. You see that rod? It is, as you doubtless know,\nMottram\u2019s; it is the one which he intended to take\nout with him on that fatal morning. You see those\nflies on it?\u201d They looked to Bredon very much like any other\nflies, and he said so. \u201cExactly. That is where special knowledge comes\nin. I don\u2019t know this river very well; but I do know\nthat it would be ridiculous to try to fish this river\nwith those particular flies, especially at this time of\nthe year and after the weather we\u2019ve been having.\nAnd I do know that a man like Mottram, who had\nbeen fishing this river year after year, couldn\u2019t\npossibly have imagined that it was any use taking those\nflies down to the Long Pool. I only mention it\nbecause it makes me rather wonder whether Mottram\nreally came down here to fish. Well, I must be\nstarting for the river. Still nursing the\nunconquerable hope. Good-morning.\u201d And, with one of his\nsudden gestures, the old gentleman was gone. A telegram came in admirably good time,\nassuring Bredon that the Bishop would be delighted to\nsee him. It was little after eleven when the car took\nthe road again; this time their way brought them\ncloser to the Busk and gave them a better view of\nits curious formation. A narrow gorge opened\nbeneath them, and they looked down into deep pools\noverhung by smooth rocks that the water had eaten\naway at their base. There was no actual waterfall,\nbut the stream always hurried downward, chuckling\nto itself under and around the boulders which\ninterrupted its course. \u201cI think Pulteney\noverestimates the danger of having his river dragged,\u201d\nobserved Bredon. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t drag that part of it;\nand, with all those shelves of rock, a corpse might\nlie for days undiscovered, and no one the wiser.\nI\u2019m glad that it\u2019s a death by gas, not by drowning.\u201d Their road now climbed onto the moors, and they\nbegan to draw closer to a desolate kind of\ncivilization. Little factory towns which had sprung up when\ndirect water-power was in demand, and continued a\nprecarious existence perched on those barren slopes\nnow that water-power had been displaced by steam,\nwere the mile-stones of their route. They were jolted\non a pavement of villainous sets; the air grew dim\nwith a smoky haze and the moorland blackened with\ntheir approach to the haunts of men. At last\ntram-lines met them, announcing the outskirts of Pullford.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting the needle rather about this interview,\u201d\nconfessed Bredon. \u201cWhat does one do by way of\nmaking one\u2019s self popular with a Catholic Bishop?\u201d\nhe demanded of Angela, who was convent-bred. \u201cWell, the right thing is to go down on one knee\nand kiss his ring. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d make much of\na show at it; we ought to have practised it before we\nleft Chilthorpe. But I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019ll eat you.\u201d Bredon tried to rearrange his ideas about Bishops.\nHe remembered the ceremony of being confirmed\nat school; a long, tiresome service, with an\ninterminable address in which he and fifty of his\ncompeers were adjured to play for their side. He\nremembered another Bishop, met in a friend\u2019s rooms\nat Oxford, a hand laid on his shoulder and an\nintolerably earnest voice asking whether he had ever\nthought of taking holy orders. Was that the sort of\nthing? Or was he rather to expect some\nsilken-tongued courtier, in purple and fine linen,\npledging him in rich liqueurs (as in the advertisements)\nand lying to him smoothly (as in the story-books)?\nWas he to be embarrassed by pietism or to be\nhoodwinked by a practised intriguer? Anyhow, he would\nknow the worst before long now. They drew up at\nthe centre of the town before a vast, smoke-grimed\nhotel which promised every sort of discomfort; and\nBredon, after asking his way to the Catholic\nCathedral, and steadying himself with a vermuth, went\nout to face the interview. The Cathedral house proved to be a good\nspecimen of that curious municipal Gothic which is the\ncurse of all institutions founded in 1850. The kind\nof house which is characterized by the guide-books\nas fine, by its inmates as beastly. The large room\ninto which Bredon was shewn was at least equally\ncheerless. It was half-panelled in atrocious\npitch-pine, and it had heavy, ecclesiastical-looking chairs\nwhich discouraged all attempts at repose. There was\na gas-stove in the fireplace. Previous occupants of\nthe See of Pullford lined the walls, in the worst\npossible style of portraiture. A plaster Madonna of the\nkind that is successively exiled from the church to\nthe sacristy and from the sacristy to the presbytery\nat once caught and repelled the eye. In point of fact,\nthe room is never used except by the canons of\nPullford when they vest for the chapter mass and\nby the strange visitor who looks a little too\nimportant to be left in a waiting-room downstairs. A door opened at the end of the room, and through\nit came a tall man dressed in black with a dash of\nred whose welcome made you forget at once all the\nchill of the reception room. The face was strong and\ndetermined, yet unaffectedly benevolent; the eyes\nmet you squarely, and did not languish at you; the\nmanner was one of embarrassed dignity, with no\nsuggestion of personal greatness. You did not feel\nthat there was the slightest danger of being asked\nwhether you meant to take orders. You did not\ncatch the smallest hint of policy or of priestcraft.\nBredon made a gesture as if to carry out Angela\u2019s\nuncomfortable prescription; but the hand that had\ncaught his was at once withdrawn in obvious\ndeprecation. He had come there as a spy, expecting to be\nspied upon; he found himself mysteriously fitting\ninto this strange household as an old friend. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr.\nBrendan.\u201d (The Chilthorpe post-office is not at its\nbest with proper names.) \u201cCome inside, please. So\nyou\u2019ve come to have a word about poor old\nMottram? He was an old friend of ours here, you know,\nand a close neighbour. You had a splendid morning\nfor motoring. Come in, please.\u201d And Bredon found\nhimself in a much smaller room, the obvious\nsanctum of a bachelor. There were pipes about, and\npipe-cleaners; there was a pleasant litter of documents\non the table; there was a piano standing open, as\npianos do when people are accustomed to strum on\nthem for mere pleasure; there was a quite\nunashamed loud-speaker in one corner. The chair into\nwhich the visitor was shepherded was voluminous\nand comfortable; you could not sit nervously on the\nedge of it if you tried. Instinctively, in such a room\nyour hand felt for your tobacco-pouch. Would Mr.\n\u201cBrendan\u201d take anything before dinner? Dinner was\ndue in three quarters of an hour. Yes, it was a very\nsad business about poor Mottram. There was a\nfeeling of genuine regret in the town. \u201cI don\u2019t really know whether I\u2019d any right to\ntrespass on My Lordship\u2019s\u2014on Your Lordship\u2019s\ntime at all,\u201d began Bredon, fighting down a growing\nsense of familiarity. \u201cIt was only that the landlady\ntold us this morning you were expected to join\nMottram at Chilthorpe just on the morning when\nhe died. So we naturally thought you might have\nknown something about his movements and his plans.\nWhen I say \u2018we,\u2019 I mean that I\u2019m more or less\nworking in with the police, because the Inspector down\nthere happens to be a man I know.\u201d (Dash it all,\nwhy was he putting all his cards on the table like\nthis?) \u201cOh, of course, I should be only too glad if I can\nbe of any use. The newspapers have just mentioned\nthe death as if it were an accident, but one of my\npriests was telling me there is a rumour in the town\nthat the poor fellow took his own life. Well, of\ncourse, I don\u2019t think that very probable.\u201d \u201cHe was quite cheerful, you mean, when you last\nsaw him?\u201d \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say cheerful, exactly; but, you\nsee, he was always a bit of a dismal Jimmy. But he\nwas in here one evening not a week ago; very glad\nto be going off for his holiday, and full of fishing\nplans. It was then he asked me to come down and\njoin him just for the day. Well, there was a tempting\nhole in my engagement book, and there\u2019s a useful\ntrain in the morning to Chilthorpe, so I promised I\nwould. Then the Vicar General rang me up the last\nthing at night and told me about an important\ninterview with some education person which he\u2019d\narranged behind my back. So I gave it up\u2014one has to\ndo what one\u2019s told\u2014and was meaning to telegraph\nto Mottram in the morning. And then this sad news\ncame along before I had time to telegraph after all.\u201d \u201cOh, the news got here as early as that?\u201d \u201cYes, that secretary of his wired to me,\nBrinkman. It was kind of him to think of me, for I know\nthe man very little. I forget the exact words he used,\n\u2018Regret to say Mr. Mottram died last night, useless\nyour coming,\u2019 something of that sort.\u201d \u201cDo you know if he meant to make any long stay\nat Chilthorpe?\u201d \u201cBrinkman would be able to tell you better than\nI could; but I fancy they generally spent about a\nfortnight there every year. Mottram himself, I\ndaresay you know, came from those parts. So far as I\nknew, this was to be the regular yearly visit.\nHonestly, I can\u2019t think why he should have been at pains\nto ask me down there if there had been any idea of\nsuicide in his mind. Of course if there was definite\ninsanity that\u2019s a different thing. But there was\nnothing about him to suggest it.\u201d \u201cDo I understand that Mottram belonged to\nyour\u2014that Mottram was a Catholic?\u201d \u201cOh, dear no! I don\u2019t think he was a church-goer\nat all. I think he believed in Almighty God, you\nknow; he was quite an intelligent man, though he\nhad not had much schooling when he was young. But\nhis friendship with us was just a matter of chance\u2014that\nand the fact that his house is so close to us. He\nwas always very kindly disposed toward us\u2014a\npeculiar man, Mr. \u2018Brendan,\u2019 and a very obstinate man\nin some ways. He liked being in the right, and\nproving himself in the right; but he was broad-minded\nin religious matters, very.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think that he would have shrunk from\nthe idea of suicide\u2014on any moral grounds, I\nmean?\u201d \u201cHe did defend suicide in a chat we had the other\nday. Of course my own feeling is that by the time a\nman has got to the state of nerves in which suicide\nseems the only way out he has generally got beyond\nthe stage at which he can really sit down and argue\nwhether it is right or wrong. At least one hopes so.\nI don\u2019t think that a person who defends suicide in\nthe abstract is any more the likely to commit\nsuicide for that or vice versa. Apart from grace, of\ncourse. But it\u2019s the absence of motive, Mr.\n\u2018Brendan.\u2019 Why should Mottram have wanted to take his\nown life?\u201d \u201cWell, My Lord, I\u2019m afraid I see these things from\nan uncharitable angle. You see, my business is all\nconnected with insurance; and Mottram was insured\nwith us, and insured heavily.\u201d \u201cWell, there you are, you see; you have the\nexperience and I haven\u2019t. But doesn\u2019t it seem to you\nstrange that a man in good health, who digests his\nmeals, and has no worries, should take his own life\nin the hope of benefiting his heirs, whoever they may\nprove to be? He had no family, you must\nremember.\u201d \u201cIn good health? Then\u2014then he didn\u2019t mention\nanything to you about his life prospects?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say that he did; but he always seemed\nto me to enjoy good health. Why, was there\nanything wrong?\u201d \u201cMy Lord, I think this ought to be confidential, if\nyou don\u2019t mind. But since you knew him so well I\nthink it\u2019s only fair to mention to you that Mottram\nhad misgivings about his health.\u201d And he narrated\nthe story of Mottram\u2019s singular interview at the\nIndescribable offices. The Bishop looked grave when\nhe had finished. \u201cDear, dear, I\u2019d no notion of that; no notion at\nall. And it\u2019s not clear even now what was wrong with\nhim? Well, of course that alters things. It must be a\ngrave temptation for people who are suffering from\na malignant disease, especially if it\u2019s a painful one;\npain clouds the reason so, doesn\u2019t it? I wish I\u2019d\nrealized that he was in trouble, though it\u2019s very\nlittle one can do. But that\u2019s just like him; he was\nalways a bit of a stoic; fine, in a rugged sort of way.\n\u2018It never did any good meeting troubles half way,\u2019\nhe used to say to me. Well, money can\u2019t do\neverything for us.\u201d \u201cHe was enormously rich, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHardly that. He was very comfortably off,\nthough. There will be a windfall, I suppose, coming\nto somebody.\u201d \u201cHe never mentioned to you, I suppose, what he\nmeant to do with his money?\u201d \u201cWell, of course, he used to say half-jokingly that\nhe was going to provide for us; but I don\u2019t think he\nmeant us to take that seriously. He had a kind of\nhankering after religion, you see, but he didn\u2019t get\non well with religious people as a general thing. The\nAnglicans, he said, were all at sixes and sevens, and\nhe couldn\u2019t bear a church which didn\u2019t know its own\nmind. The non-conformists, he said, did no sort of\ngood in the town; all those fine chapels, and only\nthirty or forty people in each of them on a Sunday\nmorning. He was a little unjust, I think, to the\nnon-conformists; they do a great deal of good, some of\nthem. And about the Salvation Army he was\nextraordinarily bitter. So he used to say he\u2019d sooner his\nmoney went to us than to any of the others. But I\nthink that was only an ironic way he had with him;\npeople who have made a lot of money are often\nfond of talking about what they\u2019re going to do with\nit. Of course it would have made a lot of difference\nto us; but I don\u2019t think he meant to be taken\nseriously.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m very much obliged to Your Lordship;\nI think, perhaps, I ought to be\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cWhat, going away, and dinner on the table? No,\nno, Mr. \u2018Brendan,\u2019 that isn\u2019t how we treat our guests\nat Pullford. Just you come along, now, and be\nintroduced to some of the reverend clergy. I know\nthe Load of Mischief, and those chops! Come on, and\nwe\u2019ll send you off in better trim than you came.\u201d It\nwas evident that there was no help for it; Angela\nmust wait.",
        "The dinner-table left a blurred impression on\nBredon, for all his habit of observing his\nfellow men and analysing his feelings about\nthem. The setting-out of the meal had faults that\nAngela would have condemned, and would have put\nright in no time; you were conscious at once that the\nhousehold belonged to bachelors. Yet the meal itself\nand the cooking of it were of excellent quality; and\nit was thrown at you with a clamorous, insistent\nhospitality that made you feel like a guest of honour.\nThe room seemed to be full of priests\u2014there were\nfive, perhaps, in reality, besides the Bishop\u2014and\nevery detail of their behaviour proved that they\nwere free from any sense of formality or restraint;\nyet constant little attentions shewed the guest that\nhe was never forgotten. The topic of conversation\nwhich Bredon (who in the mean time had informed\nthe Bishop of the post-office mistake) could recall\nmost distinctly afterward was a learned and almost\ntechnical discussion between the Bishop and the\nyoungest priest present on the prospects of the\nlocal soccer team for next year. Nothing fitted in,\nsomehow, with his scheme of probabilities; there was\na Father O\u2019Shaughnessy, who had been born and\nbred in Pullford and never seemed to have been\noutside it; there was a Father Edwards who talked with\na violent Irish brogue. A teetotaller opposite kept\nplying him with Barsac. It was perhaps a delicate attention that Bredon\u2019s\nneighbour, on the side away from the Bishop, was\nthe only other layman present. He was introduced\nas the Bishop\u2019s secretary; and he was the only man\nin the room who looked like a clergyman. He seemed\nsome fifty years old; he was silent by habit, and\nspoke with a dry humour that seemed to amuse\neverybody except himself. Bredon could not help\nwondering how such a man came to occupy such a\nposition at his time of life, for his voice betrayed\nuniversity education and he was plainly competent,\nyet he obviously thought of himself as a\nsupernumerary in the household. The riddle was solved\nwhen Bredon, in answer to some question about his\njourney down to Chilthorpe, explained that he did\nnot come from London itself, but from a village in\nSurrey, a place called Burrington. \u201cWhat!\u201d\nexclaimed Mr. Eames, the secretary, \u201cnot Burrington\nnear Hipley?\u201d And, when Bredon asked if he knew\nHipley, \u201cKnow it? I ought to. I was rector there\nfor ten years.\u201d The picture of the rectory at Hipley stood out\nbefore Bredon\u2019s mind; you see it from the main\nroad. There is an old-fashioned tennis-lawn in front\nof it; roses cluster round it endearingly; there is a\ncool dignity about the Queen Anne house, the\nterraces of which are spotlessly mowed. Yes, you could\nput this man in clerical clothes, and he would fit\nbeautifully into that spacious garden; you saw him,\nwith surplice fluttering in the breeze, going up the\nchurchyard path to ring the bell for evening service;\nthat was his atmosphere. And here, unfrocked by\nhis own conscience, he was living as a hired servant,\nalmost a pensioner, in this gaunt house, these\ncheerless rooms.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You wondered less at his silent\nhabit, and his melancholy airs of speech. Nothing creates intimacy like a common\nbackground discovered among strangers. They belonged,\nit seemed, to the same university, the same college;\ntheir periods were widely different, but dons and\nscouts, the mile-stones of short-lived undergraduate\nmemory, were recalled, and their mannerisms\ndiscussed; and when at the end of the meal the Bishop\nrose, profuse in his apologies, to attend a meeting,\nEames volunteered to walk Bredon back to his hotel.\n\u201cI thought there\u2019d be no harm, My Lord, if we just\ntook a look in at poor Mottram\u2019s house; I daresay\nit would interest Mr. Bredon to see it. The\nhousekeeper,\u201d he explained to Bredon, \u201cis one of our\npeople.\u201d The Bishop approved the suggestion; and with a\nchorus of farewells they left the Cathedral house\ntogether. \u201cWell,\u201d said Bredon to his companion,\n\u201cyou\u2019ve got a wonderful Bishop here.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Eames, \u201cthe mind dwells with pleasure\non the thought of him. There are few of us for whom\nmore can be said than that.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t fit Mottram, from what I\u2019ve heard of\nhim, into that household.\u201d \u201cBecause you\u2019re not a provincial. Our common\nroots are in Oxford and in London. But in a place\nlike this people know one another because they are\nneighbours.\u201d \u201cEven the clergy?\u201d \u201cThe Catholic clergy, anyhow. You see, our\npriests don\u2019t swap about from one diocese to\nanother; they are tied to the soil. Consequently they\nare local men, most of them, and a local man feels\nat home with them.\u201d \u201cStill, for a man who had no religion particularly,\nisn\u2019t it rather a challenge to be up against your\nfaith like that? I should have thought a man was\nbound to react one way or the other.\u201d \u201cNot necessarily. It\u2019s astonishing what a lot of\ntheoretical interest a man can take in the faith and\nyet be miles away from it practically. Why, Mottram\nhimself, about three weeks ago, was pestering us all\nabout the old question of \u2018the end justifying the\nmeans.\u2019 Being a Protestant, of course he meant by\nthat doing evil in order that good may come. He\nworried the life out of the Bishop, urging the most\nplausible reasons for maintaining that it was\nperfectly right. He simply couldn\u2019t see why the Bishop\ninsisted you weren\u2019t ever allowed to do what\u2019s wrong,\nwhatever comes of it. And the odd thing was, he\nreally seemed to think he was being more Catholic\nover it than we were. However, all that bores you.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed. I want to know everything about\nMottram; and it\u2019s silly to pretend that a man\u2019s\nreligion doesn\u2019t matter. Was he thinking at all, do\nyou suppose, of becoming a Catholic?\u201d Eames shrugged his shoulders. \u201cHow can I tell?\nI don\u2019t think he really shewed any dispositions. But\nof course he was a religious man in a way, he wasn\u2019t\none of your nogoddites, like Brinkman. You\u2019ve met\nBrinkman?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019m staying in the same hotel, you see. And\nI confess I\u2019m interested in him too. What do you\nmake of him? Who is he, or where did Mottram pick\nhim up?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like the little man. I don\u2019t\neven know what his nationality is; he\u2019s spent a long\ntime in Paris, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not British.\nAnd mind you, he hated us. I think he had\ncorresponded for some paper out in Paris; anyhow, he\nknew all the seedy anti-clericals; and I rather think\nhe was asked to leave. Mottram seems to have taken\nhim on on the recommendation of a friend; he had\nsome idea, I think, of doing a history of the town;\nand of course Brinkman can write. But Brinkman\nvery seldom came in here, and when he did he was\nlike a dog among snakes. I daresay he thought the\nhouse was full of oubliettes. He\u2019d got all that\nContinental anti-clericalism, you see. Here\u2019s the house.\u201d They turned up a short drive which led them\nthrough a heavily walled park to the front door of a\npainfully mid-Victorian mansion. A mansion it must\nbe called; it did not look like a house. Strange\nreminiscences of various styles, Gothic, Byzantine,\nOriental, seemed to have been laid on by some external\nprocess to a red-brick abomination of the early\nseventies. Cream-coloured and slate-coloured tiles\nwove irrelevant patterns across the bare spaces of\nwall, Conservatories masked a good half of the\nlowest storey. It was exactly suited to be what it\nafterward became, a kind of municipal museum, in\nwhich the historic antiquities of Pullford, such as\nthey were, could be visited by the public on dreary\nSunday afternoons. \u201cNow,\u201d said Eames, \u201cdoes that give you\nMottram\u2019s atmosphere?\u201d \u201cGod forbid!\u201d replied Bredon. \u201cSee then the penalty of too great riches. Only\none man in a thousand can express his personality\nin his surroundings if he has a million of money\nto do it with. It wasn\u2019t Mottram, of course, who did\nthis; but he would have built the same sort of horror\nif he hadn\u2019t taken it over from a predecessor like\nhimself. And the rooms are as bad as the house.\u201d Eames was fully justified in this last criticism.\nThe house was full of expensive bad taste; the crude\nwork of local artists hung on the walls; bulging\ngoddesses supported unnecessary capitals; velvet\nand tarnished gilding and multicoloured slabs of\nmarble completed the resemblance to a large station\nrestaurant. Mottram had possessed no private\nhousehold gods, had preserved no cherished knickknacks.\nThe house was the fruit of his money, not of his\npersonality. He had given the architect a free hand,\nand in the midst of all that barbaric splendour he\nhad lived a homeless exile. The housekeeper had little to add to what Bredon\nalready knew. Her master usually went away for a\nholiday about that time in the year, and Mr.\nBrinkman always went with him. He had expected to be\naway for a fortnight, or perhaps three weeks. He\nhad not shewn, to the servants at any rate, any\nsigns of depression or anxiety; he had not left any\nparting messages to suggest a long absence. His\nletters were to be redirected, as usual, to the Load of\nMischief. There had been none, as a matter of fact,\nexcept a few bills and circulars. She didn\u2019t think\nthat Mr. Mottram went to any of the Pullford\ndoctors, regularly at least; and she had had no\nknowledge of his seeing the specialist in London. She did\nnot remember Mr. Mottram being ill, except for an\noccasional cold, though he did now and again take\na sleeping draught. \u201cIt\u2019s quite true,\u201d said Eames as they left the\nhouse, \u201cthat we never noticed any signs of depression\nor anxiety in Mottram. But I do remember, only a\nshort time ago, his seeming rather excited one\nevening when he was round with us. Or am I imagining\nit? Memory and imagination are such close\nneighbours. But I do think that when he asked the Bishop\nto go and stay down at Chilthorpe he seemed\nunnaturally insistent about it. He was fond of the Bishop,\nof course, but I shouldn\u2019t have thought he was as\nfond of him as all that. To hear him talk, you would\nthink that it was going to make all the difference to\nhim whether the Bishop shared his holiday or not.\u201d \u201cYes, I wonder what that points to?\u201d \u201cAnything or nothing. It\u2019s possible, of course,\nthat he was feeling depressed, as he well might be;\nand thought that he wanted more than Brinkman\u2019s\ncompany to help him over a bad time. Or\u2014I don\u2019t\nknow. He was always secretive. He gave the Bishop\na car, you know; and took endless pains to find out\nbeforehand what sort of car would be useful to\nhim, without ever giving away what he was doing\ntill the last moment. And the other evening\u2014well, I\nfeel now as if I\u2019d felt then that he had something up\nhis sleeve. But did I really feel it then? I don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d \u201cOn the whole, though, you incline to the suicide\ntheory?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. It\u2019s possible, isn\u2019t it, that a\nman who had some premonition of a violent end\nmight want company when he went to a lonely place\nlike Chilthorpe?\u201d \u201cHad he any enemies, do you think, in Pullford?\u201d \u201cWho hasn\u2019t? But not that sort of enemies. He\nused, I fancy, to be something of a martinet with\nhis work-people, in the old manner. In America, a\ndisgruntled employee sometimes satisfies his\nvendetta with a shotgun. But in England we have no\nmurdering classes. Even the burglars, I am told,\nmake a principle of going unarmed, for fear they\nmight be tempted to shoot. You would probably find\ntwo or three hundred men in Pullford who would\ngrouse at Mottram\u2019s success and call him a\nbloodsucker, but not one who would up with a piece of\nlead piping if he met him in a lonely lane.\u201d \u201cI say, it\u2019s been very kind of you looking after\nme like this. I wish, if you\u2019ve any time to spare in\nthe next day or two, you would drop down to\nChilthorpe and help me to make the case out. Or is that\nasking too much?\u201d \u201cNot the least. The Bishop goes off to a\nconfirmation to-morrow and I shall probably have time\non my hands. If you think I could be of any use, I\u2019ll\ncertainly look in. I like Chilthorpe; every prospect\npleases and only the chops are vile. No, I won\u2019t come\nin, thanks; I ought to be getting back now.\u201d Angela was a little inclined to be satirical at her\nhusband\u2019s prolonged absence; but she seemed to\nhave killed the time with some success. She had not\neven been reduced to going round the early Perp.\nchurch. They made short work of the way back to\nChilthorpe, and found Leyland eagerly awaiting\nthem at the door of the hotel. \u201cWell,\u201d he asked, \u201chave you found out anything\nabout Mottram?\u201d \u201cNot much, and that\u2019s a fact. Except that a man\nwho strikes me as a competent observer thought he\nhad noticed a certain amount of excitement in\nMottram\u2019s manner last week, as if he had been more\nthan ordinarily anxious to get the Bishop to stay\nwith him. That, and the impression made on the\nsame observer that he was keeping dark about\nsomething\u2014had something up his sleeve. I have seen the\nhouse; it is a beastly place; and it has electric light\nlaid on, of course. I have seen the housekeeper, an\nentirely harmless woman, partly Irish by extraction,\nwho has nothing to add to what we know, and does\nnot believe that Mottram habitually employed any\nof the Pullford doctors.\u201d \u201cWell, and what about the Bishop?\u201d \u201cExactly, what about him? I find his atmosphere\nvery difficult to convey. He was very nice to me and\nvery hospitable; he has not the overpowering\nmanners of a great man, and yet his dignities seem to sit\non him quite easily. He is entirely natural, and I am\nprepared to go bail for his being an honest man.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cis just as well.\u201d \u201cHow do you mean? Have you had the answer to\nyour telegram?\u201d \u201cI have, and a very full answer it is. The solicitors\ngave all the facts without a murmur. About fifteen\nyears ago Mottram made a will which was chiefly in\nfavour of his nephew. A few years later he cancelled\nthat will absolutely and made another will in which\nhe devised his property to certain public\npurposes\u2014stinkingly useless ones, as is the way of these very\nrich men. I can\u2019t remember it all; but he wants his\nhouse to be turned into a silly sort of museum, and\nhe provides for the erection of a municipal art\ngallery\u2014that sort of thing. But this is the important\npoint: His Euthanasia policy was not mentioned at\nall in the later will. Three weeks ago he put in a\ncodicil directing how the money he expects from the\nIndescribable is to be disposed of.\u201d \u201cNamely how?\u201d \u201cThe entire half-million goes to the Bishop of\nPullford to be administered by him for the benefit of\nhis diocese as he and his successors shall think fit!\u201d",
        "There was no time to discuss the\nimplications of this unexpected announcement, for\nthe inquest was just beginning, and neither\nLeyland nor Bredon could afford to miss it. There\nwas a decayed outbuilding which adjoined the Load\nof Mischief, the scene, you fancied, of the farmers\u2019\nordinary in more prosperous times. Here the good\nmen and true were to deliver their verdict and the\nCoroner his platitudes. Brinkman\u2019s evidence need not be repeated here,\nfor it followed exactly the lines we already know.\nThe local doctor and the Boots corroborated his\naccount so far as the discovery of the corpse was\nconcerned. Particular attention was naturally called\nto the tap and to the locked door. The doctor was\nabsolutely positive that the tap was turned off when\nhe reached it; the fumes had blown away a good\ndeal by that time, and his first action was to put a\nmatch to both jets in turn. Neither gave the least\npromise of a flame, although the jet on the standard\nstood open; there was no doubt, then, that the main\ntap sufficiently controlled both outlets. Asked\nwhether he turned the main tap on to experiment, the\ndoctor said \u201cNo,\u201d and was congratulated by the\nCoroner on his circumspection. The work of the\npolice would be much facilitated, observed that\nprudent functionary, if people would leave things\nas they found them. After testing the gas the doctor\u2019s\nnext action had been to attend to the patient. Much\nmedical detail followed at this point, but with no\nresults that would be new to us. Asked how long it\nwould have taken for the gas to cause asphyxiation,\nthe doctor was uncertain. It all depended, he said,\non the position of the window, which must clearly at\nsome time have blown farther open than it had been\noriginally. It was his impression that the death must\nhave occurred about one o\u2019clock in the morning;\nbut there were no sure tests by which the exact\nmoment of death could be determined. The Boots, by his own account, entered the room\nimmediately after the doctor. The door of the room\nhad fallen almost flat when it fell in; not quite flat,\nfor it was not entirely separated from the lower\nhinge. The Boots made his way over this, and helped\nthe doctor by supplying him with a match. When the\ndoctor went across to the bed, he himself went to\nthe window to throw the match out. Dr. Ferrers had\njoined Mr. Brinkman at the bed, so he devoted\nhimself to examining, and trying to hoist up, the\nwreckage of the door. The lock was right out, and the key\nduly turned on the inside of the door. It was not\nusual for him to call guests in the morning, but he\nhad arranged to do so on that particular occasion.\nHe noticed the smell of gas even outside the door,\nbut did not feel sure there was anything wrong until\nhe tried the door and found it locked. It was not\nusual for guests to lock their doors in that hotel,\nalthough keys were provided for the purpose. Yes, he\ndid bend down and look through the keyhole, but it\nwas completely dark\u2014naturally, since the key was\nin the lock. He went and asked Mr. Brinkman what\nhe should do, because he was anxious not to go\nbeyond his orders. The barmaid had really nothing to contribute. She\nhad not been into the room at all after six o\u2019clock or\nit might be half-past on the Monday evening, when\nshe went in to put everything to rights. Pressed to\ninterpret this phrase, she said it meant turning down\nthe corner of the bedclothes. She had not struck a\nmatch, naturally, since it was broad daylight. She\nhad never noticed any leak of gas in that room since\nthe plumber had paid a visit in the previous March.\nThere was nothing wrong, she thought, about the\ncatch of the window; certainly no visitor had ever\ncomplained of its fetching loose in the night. The\nBible, she thought, had been by the bedside when\nshe went into the room at six or it might have been\nhalf-past. She did not move it, nor did she interfere\nin any way with the arrangements of the room. Mrs. Davis confirmed this evidence as far as it\nneeded confirmation. It was she who had taken the\norder from Mottram about his being called early in\nthe morning. He had spoken to her quite naturally,\nand said good-night to her cheerfully. Mr. Pulteney\u2019s evidence was entirely negligible.\nHe had noticed nothing the evening before, had\nheard nothing in the night, had not entered the room\nsince the tragedy occurred. The Coroner spread himself in his allocution to\nthe jurymen. He reminded them that an escape of gas\ncould not properly be described as an act of God. He\npointed out that it was impossible to return a\nverdict of death from unknown causes, since the cause\nof death was known. If they were prepared to give\nany new explanation of the fact that the gas was\nturned off, they might bring in a verdict of death by\nmisadventure, or by suicide; in the latter case, it\nwas possible to add a rider saying that the deceased\nwas of unsound mind. If they were prepared to give\nany new explanation of the locked door, it was\npossible for them to bring in a verdict of wilful murder\nagainst a person or persons unknown. The jurymen, unequal to the intellectual strain\nwhich seemed to be demanded of them, returned an\nopen verdict. The Coroner thanked them, and made\nthem a little speech which had not really much\nbearing on the situation. He pointed out the superiority\nof electric light over gas; in a house lit by electric\nlight this could never have happened. He called\nattention to the importance of making certain that\nthe gas was turned off before you got into bed, and\nthe almost equal importance of seeing that your\nwindow was well and truly opened. And so the inquest\nended, and Mottram, who had expressed no desire\nin his will as to where or how he should be buried,\nwas laid to rest next day in the churchyard of the\nlittle town which had seen his early struggles, and\nPullford remembered him no more. As soon as the inquest was over, Leyland and\nBredon met by arrangement to discuss further the\nbearings of the new discovery. They avoided the inn\nitself, partly because the day\u2019s events had left it\novercrowded, partly because they were afraid, since\nBredon\u2019s experience the night before, of speaking\nto a concealed audience. A slight rain was falling,\nand they betook themselves to the back of the inn,\nwhere a rambling path led along the river-bank\nthrough the ruins of an old mill. Next the disused\nmill-wheel there was a little room or shed, whose\ngaping walls and roof afforded, nevertheless,\nsufficient shelter from the weather. A \u201crustic seat,\u201d\nmade of knobby branches overlaid with dark brown\nvarnish, offered uncomfortable repose. Draughts at\nthe back of your neck, or sudden leakage in the\nslates above you, would cause you now and again to\nshift your attitude uneasily; but, since the Load of\nMischief did not abound with amenities in any case,\nthey were content with their quarters. \u201cI confess I\u2019m a little shaken,\u201d admitted Bredon.\n\u201cNot that I see any logical reason for altering my\nown point of view; but I don\u2019t want it to be suicide\nnow as much as I did. The Bishop is such a jolly\nold man; and he could so obviously do with half a\nmillion, if only to put in new wall-paper. He might\neven give his secretary a rise. I tell you, I hate the\nidea of advising the company not to pay up. It can\nafford the money so easily. But I suppose I must\nhave a sort of conscience about me somewhere, for\nI\u2019m still determined to get at the truth. This codicil,\nyou say, was put in less than three weeks ago?\u201d \u201cJust about that. As nearly as I can calculate it\nmust have been just before, not after, Mottram\u2019s\nvisit to the Indescribable.\u201d \u201cThe thing becomes more confusing than ever. If\nhe did want to endow the Diocese of Pullford, why\ndid he offer to resign his Euthanasia claim on\ncondition that we repaid half his premiums? And if he\ndidn\u2019t want to endow the Diocese of Pullford, why\ndid he take the trouble of altering his will in its\nfavour?\u201d \u201cRemember, when he drew up the codicil he may\nnot have seen the specialist.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true too. Now, look here, supposing he\nhadn\u2019t put the codicil in, what would have become of\nthe Euthanasia money? Would it have gone, like the\nrest, into these silly schemes of his about art\ngalleries?\u201d \u201cNo; it wasn\u2019t just a vague will, nothing about\n\u2018all I die possessed of.\u2019 The whole thing was itemized\nvery clearly, and no allowance had been made at all\nfor the disposal of the Euthanasia money.\nConsequently, if he hadn\u2019t made the codicil, the\nEuthanasia money would have gone to his next of kin.\u201d \u201cIn fact, to this nephew? Really, I begin to want\nto see this nephew.\u201d \u201cYou have seen him.\u201d \u201cSeen him\u2014where?\u201d \u201cAt the inquest. Didn\u2019t you notice a rather seedy\nlittle fellow, with a face like a rat, who was standing\nabout in the porch just when it was over? That\u2019s\nyour man; Simmonds his name is, and if you want\nto get a taste of his quality, nothing\u2019s easier, for he\nserves in his own shop. On a plea of braces trouble,\nshortage of cough lozenges, or what you will, his\ntime is yours from ten in the morning to seven at\nnight.\u201d \u201cYes, I noticed the little man. I can\u2019t say I was\nprepossessed. But I must certainly improve the\nacquaintance. I suppose it\u2019s not fair to ask what you\nmake of him?\u201d \u201cOh, personally, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve made much of\nhim. I had a talk, and his manner and statements\nseemed to be perfectly straightforward. No\nnervousness, no embarrassment.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s one other thing about Mottram\u2019s will\nthat\u2019s clearly important. You got it, I gather, from\nthe solicitors; did you find out from them whether\nthe terms of it were made public in any way?\u201d \u201cAbout the main will they thought there was no\nsecret. Mottram seems to have talked it over with\nmembers of the Pullford Town Council. Also the\nlawyers were directed to send a full statement of it\nto young Simmonds, as a kind of rebuke; Simmonds,\nyou see, had annoyed Mottram at the time. But this\ncodicil was a different affair; it was extremely\nconfidential. Brinkman himself\u2014though of course he\nmay have been lying, or being discreet\u2014professed\nignorance of it. I should think it very improbable\nthat anybody knows about it yet, except you and me\nand Mrs. Bredon and of course the lawyers\nthemselves.\u201d \u201cThen there\u2019s a chance, I suppose, that Simmonds\nthought, and still thinks, he is coming in for a\nwindfall from our company? Or do you think he didn\u2019t\nknow Mottram was insured?\u201d \u201cHe must have; because the Euthanasia policy\nwas explicitly mentioned in the earlier will, the one\nwhich was cancelled. So you are not the only person\nwho\u2019s interested in young Simmonds. Well, what do\nyou make of it all?\u201d \u201cLet me tell you one thing; it wouldn\u2019t be fair if\nI didn\u2019t. About three weeks ago Mottram had an\nargument with the Bishop of Pullford on a matter of\ntheology. Mottram was trying to persuade the\nBishop that you were morally justified in doing evil\nin order that good might come of it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very much obliged for the information, old\nman, but I\u2019m not much interested in these\nspeculative questions. I\u2019m concerned to hunt out the people\nwho do evil, whether good comes of it or not.\u201d \u201cBut the information doesn\u2019t impress you?\u201d \u201cNot much.\u201d \u201cVery well, then. Will you double that bet?\u201d \u201cDouble the bet? You\u2019re mad! Why, I was just\ngoing to make the same offer, feeling sure you\u2019d\nrefuse. It\u2019s taking your money.\u201d \u201cNever mind that. Are you on?\u201d \u201cOn? Why, I\u2019m prepared to redouble if you like.\u201d \u201cDone! That\u2019s twenty pounds each way. Now,\nwould you like to hear my reading of the story?\u201d \u201cBy all means. And then I shall have the pleasure\nof putting you wise.\u201d \u201cWell, from the first, the whole thing smelled of\nsuicide to me. Every step Mottram took seemed to\nbe the calculated step of a man who was leading up\nto some deliberate d\u00e9nouement. He was mysterious,\nhe was excited, when he went round the other night\nto the Cathedral house. When he came here, he made\nthe most obvious attempts to try to behave as if\neverything was going on just as usual. He made\nfussy arrangements about being called in the\nmorning; he pretended to have left a letter half-finished;\nhe put a novel down by the bedside, wound up his\nwatch, put studs in his shirt\u2014he did everything to\ncreate the surface impression, good enough (he\nthought) for the Coroner, that whatever else was\nthe truth suicide was out of the question. He made\none or two slips there\u2014writing down his name in the\nvisitors\u2019 book with a blank for his date of\ndeparture, as if any guest ever did that; putting the\nflies ready on his rod, but (so Pulteney tells me)\nthe wrong kind of flies. To make sure that there\nwas not a verdict of suicide, he even made\narrangements\u2014through Brinkman, through Mrs. Davis, I\ndon\u2019t know how\u2014to have the gas in his bedroom\nturned off again after it had done its work. Then he\ntossed off his sleeping draught, turned the gas on,\nand got into bed. I was sure of all that, even before\nI went over to Pullford, before you got the telegram\nfrom London. What I couldn\u2019t understand was the\nmotive; and now that\u2019s as plain as daylight. He was\ndetermined to endow the Pullford Diocese with half\na million, so as to be sure of having his nest well\nlined in the next world. He knew that Christian\nmorality doesn\u2019t permit suicide, but he thought he\nwas all right, because he was only doing evil in order\nthat good might come of it. And so he got rid of the\nspectre of a painful death from disease, and at the\nsame time made sure, he thought, of a welcome on\nthe other side, if there should prove to be an\neternity.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s your idea. I don\u2019t deny it hangs\ntogether. But it comes up against two things\u2014fatally,\nI think. If Mottram was so set upon endowing the\nPullford Diocese, why did he bequeath most of his\nfortune to a footling Town Council and only leave\nthe diocese the one bit of money which, if a verdict\nof suicide was given, could never be touched? And\ngranted that he was at pains to get some one to turn\noff the gas for him, so as to avoid the appearance of\nsuicide, why did he tell that person to lock the door,\nand leave the key on the wrong side? That\u2019s the\nproblem you\u2019ve set yourself.\u201d \u201cOh, God knows, I don\u2019t see my way clear yet.\nBut there\u2019s the outlines of the thing. Now let\u2019s hear\nthe proxime accessit solution.\u201d \u201cI feel inclined to apologize. I feel ashamed of\nbeing so right. But you\u2019ve asked for it. Look here,\nthe thing which has complicated this case so badly\nis the appearance of bluff. At one moment it looked\nlike suicide pretending to be accident or murder; at\nanother time it looked like murder pretending to be\nsuicide. But the great mountainous fact that stands\nout is the turning off of the gas. In the event of\nsuicide, that was impossible; in the event of murder, it\nwas curiously needless. For it entirely removed the\npossibility of a suicide verdict. It was only as I was\ngetting into bed last night that the truth flashed upon\nme. The gas was turned off by a murderer\ndeliberately, and, mark this, in order to shew that the\nmurder was not suicide. It was a deliberate protest,\nan advertisement. Make what you like of this case\n(it seemed to say); but do not call it suicide; that\nat least is outside the scheme of possibilities.\u201d \u201cWell, my solution was rather by way of\nallowing for that.\u201d \u201cTo be sure. But, you see, you involve yourself in\na hopeless psychological improbability. You make a\nman commit suicide, leaving behind him an\naccomplice who will turn off the gas. Now, it\u2019s an\nextraordinary thing, our human love of interference; but I\ndon\u2019t believe it possible to have an accomplice in\nsuicide. Except, of course, for those \u2018death pacts\u2019\nwhich we are all familiar with. Tell any one that you\nmean to commit suicide and that person will not\nonly try to dissuade you but will scheme to prevent\nyour bringing the thing off. Suicide here would\ninvolve an accomplice; therefore it was not suicide.\nIt was murder; and yet the murderer, so far from\nwanting to make it appear suicide, was particularly\nanxious to make it clear that it was not suicide.\nThere is a strange situation for you. \u201cThe strange situations, the mysterious situations,\nare not those which are most difficult to unravel.\nYou can proceed in this case to look for the\nmurderer in the certainty that he is some one who would\nstand to lose if a verdict of suicide were brought in.\nPuzzling it over last night I was unable to conceive\nsuch a person. Between you and me, I had been\ninclined to suspect Brinkman; but there did not seem\nto be any possible reason why he should want to\nmurder Mottram; and, if he did, there was no\nconceivable reason why he should want to make it\nappear that Mottram did not commit suicide.\nBrinkman was not the heir; the Euthanasia policy did not\naffect him. \u201cMy discoveries of this morning put me on an\nentirely different track. There was one man in the\nworld, and only one, whose interest bade him\nmurder Mottram, and murder him in such a way that no\nsuspicion of suicide could rest over the event. I mean,\nof course, young Simmonds. It was in his interest,\nas he must have thought, to murder Mottram,\nbecause if Mottram lived to be sixty-five the\nEuthanasia policy would run out. This was Simmonds\u2019s last\nchance but one, assuming that Mottram\u2019s yearly\nvisits to Chilthorpe were the best chance of doing\naway with him. In two years from now Mottram\nwould have turned sixty-five and the half-million\nwould have vanished into the air. Moreover, there\nwas much to be said for haste: who could tell when\nMottram might not take it into his head to draw up\na new will? As it seemed to Simmonds, he had only\nto get rid of this lonely, crusty old bachelor by a\npainless death, and he, as the next of kin, would\nwalk straight into five hundred thousand.\nMeanwhile, there must be no suspicion of suicide, for any\nsuch suspicion might mean that your company would\nrefuse to pay up and the half-million would have\ndisappeared once more. \u201cTo young Simmonds, as he let himself in by the\nground-floor casement into the Load of Mischief,\nonly one fear presented itself\u2014the fear of a false\nverdict. He was of the type that cannot commit\ncold-blooded murder. The more civilization\nadvances the more ingenious does crime become;\nmeanwhile, it becomes more and more difficult for\none man to kill another with his hands. Simmonds\nmight have been a poisoner; as it was, he had\ndiscovered a safer way: he would be a gasser. But there\nwas this defect about the weapon he was using\u2014it\nmight create a false impression on the jury.\nImperative, then, not merely to kill his man but to prove\nthat he had killed him. That is why, after turning\non the gas in the sleeping man\u2019s room, he waited for\ntwo hours or so outside; then came back, flung open\nthe window to get air, and turned the gas off again,\nonly pausing to make sure that his victim was dead. \u201cHow he worked the door trick I don\u2019t know. We\nshall find out later. Meanwhile, let me tell you that\none of the friends I made last night in the bar\nparlour told me he had seen Simmonds hanging round\nthe hotel just after closing time, although (for the\nfellow is a teetotaller) he had not been drinking\nthere. This was on the very night of the murder.\nThat was a point in which I was in a position to\nscore off you. There was another point, over which\nyou had the same opportunities of information, but\nneglected them. You remember the letter which\nMottram left lying about in his bedroom? It was in\nanswer to a correspondent who signed himself\n\u2018Brutus.\u2019 I took the trouble to get from the offices\nof the Pullford Examiner a copy of the issue in\nwhich that letter appeared. It is a threatening letter,\nwarning Mottram that retribution would come upon\nhim for the bloodsucking methods by which his\nmoney had been made. And it was signed \u2018Brutus.\u2019\nYou\u2019ve had a classical education; you ought to have\nspotted the point; personally I looked it up in an\nencyclop\u00e6dia. Brutus wasn\u2019t merely a demagogue;\nhe led the revolt in Rome which resulted in the\nexpulsion of his own maternal uncle, King Tarquin.\nThe same relation, you see, that there was between\nSimmonds and Mottram. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve applied for a warrant. I\u2019m in no hurry\nto use it; for, as long as Simmonds is off his guard,\nhe\u2019s all the more likely to give himself away.\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m having him watched. If you go and talk\nto him, just to form your own impressions, I know\nyou\u2019ll be careful not to say anything which would\ngive away my suspicions. And I can wait for that\ntwenty pounds too.\u201d Bredon sat spellbound. He could see the whole\nthing happening; he could trace every calculation in\nthe mind of the criminal. And yet he was not\nconvinced. He was just about to explain this, when a\nfresh thought struck him and interfered with their\nsession. \u201cLeyland,\u201d he said, in a very quiet voice,\n\u201cyou aren\u2019t smoking, and I\u2019ve had my pipe out these\nlast ten minutes. Can you tell me why there should\nbe a smell of cigarette smoke?\u201d Leyland looked round, suddenly on the alert. It\nwas only as he looked round that he noticed how\ninsecure was their privacy. The rain had stopped\nsome time since, and there was no reason why an\ninterloper should not be standing outside, listening\nthrough one of the numerous chinks in the wall\nbehind them. Gripping Bredon\u2019s arm, he darted out\nsuddenly, and rounded the corner of the building.\nThere was nobody there. But close to the wall lay a\ncigarette-end, flattened and soiled as if it had been\ntrodden by a human foot. And as Leyland picked it\nup a faint spark and a thin stream of smoke shewed\nthat it had been trodden on only a moment before,\nnot quite successfully. \u201cCallipoli,\u201d he read,\nexamining the stump. \u201cNot the sort of cigarette one buys\nin the village. It looks to me, Bredon, as if we were\non the track of something fresh here. We\u2019ll leave\nthat cigarette-stump exactly where we found it.\u201d",
        "\u201cAngela,\u201d said Bredon when he found her,\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a job of work for you.\u201d \u201cSuch as?\u201d \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is to make Brinkman and\nPulteney open their cigarette-cases for inspection\nwithout knowing that they\u2019re doing it.\u201d \u201cMiles, it won\u2019t do. You know I can\u2019t work in\nblinkers. There\u2019s nothing I dislike so much as a want\nof complete confidence between husband and wife.\nSit down and tell me all about it. You\u2019d better make\nsure of the door first.\u201d And she turned down the little\nshutter which protected their keyhole on the inside. \u201cOh, all right,\u201d said Bredon, and told the story\nof their recent alarms. \u201cIt almost must be somebody\nin the house. Brinkman and Pulteney are both\ncigarette-smokers, and of course it would be easy\nfor me to cadge a cigarette by saying I\u2019d run short.\nBut that just might put the mysterious gentleman on\nhis guard. And I don\u2019t want to hang about picking\nup fags. So what you\u2019ve got to do is to lead round\nthe conversation in such a way that we can have an\nopportunity of finding out what cigarettes each of\nthem smokes without his suspecting anything.\u201d \u201cWhy not pinch some from their rooms?\u201d \u201cIt might work. But since people took to smoking\nall kinds of vile cigarettes at the end of the war,\none doesn\u2019t trouble to carry one\u2019s own brand about.\nOne buys them at the local shop. These Callipolis\nare an oddity, but there probably aren\u2019t many more\nwhere they came from, and the safest place to look\nfor them is inside somebody\u2019s breast-pocket.\nAnyhow, you might try.\u201d \u201cSort of salted almonds game?\u201d said Angela\nreflectively. \u201cAll right, I will. Don\u2019t you try your\nhand at it; sit there and back me up. Meanwhile,\nyou\u2019d better go down and have a pick-me-up at the\nbar, because I\u2019m going to dress for dinner.\u201d \u201cDress for dinner, in a hole like this? Whatever\nfor?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the technique of the thing.\nIf I\u2019m to have complete control of the conversation,\nI must be looking my best. It makes all the\ndifference with a susceptible old dear like Edward.\u201d She certainly had made herself look attractive, if\na trifle exotic, by the time she came downstairs. The\nmaid all but broke the soup-plates at the sight of her. \u201cDid you see much of Pullford, Mrs. Bredon?\u201d\nasked Brinkman, on hearing of their day\u2019s\nexpedition. \u201cMuch of it? Why, I\u2019m practically a native of the\nplace by now. I shall never see a perambulator again,\nI mean a drain-pipe, without a sort of homely feeling.\nMy husband left me alone for three solid hours while\nhe went and caroused with the hierarchy.\u201d \u201cA very genial man, isn\u2019t he, the Bishop,\u201d said\nBrinkman, appealing to her husband. \u201cWhat a poor compliment that word genial is,\u201d\nput in the old gentleman. \u201cI would sooner be called\nwell-meaning, myself. You have no grounds for\nsaying that a man is really kind or charitable; you have\nnot personally found him attractive; and yet he has\na sort of good-natured way with him which demands\nsome tribute. So you say he is genial.\u201d \u201cLike a Dickens character?\u201d suggested Brinkman. \u201cNo, they are too human to be called merely\ngenial. Mr. Pickwick genial! It is like calling the\nday of judgment a fine sight. How did Pusey, by\nthe way, ever have the wit to light upon such a\ncomparison?\u201d \u201cI think witty is rather a dreadful thing to be\ncalled,\u201d said Angela. \u201cI always think of witty\npeople as people who dominate the conversation with\nlong anecdotes. How glad I am to have been born\ninto a world in which the anecdote has gone out of\nfashion!\u201d \u201cA hemisphere, Mrs. Bredon,\u201d said Brinkman in\ncorrection. \u201cYou have not been to America? The\nanecdote there is in its first youth; the anecdotes\nmostly in their extreme old age.\u201d \u201cThere is a pleasant dryness about American\nhumour,\u201d objected Pulteney. \u201cBut I confess that I\nmiss piquancy in it.\u201d \u201cLike Virginian tobacco?\u201d suggested Bredon, and\nwas rewarded by a savage kick from Angela under\nthe table. \u201cThe anecdote, however,\u201d pursued Mr. Pulteney,\n\u201cis the enemy of conversation. With its appearance,\nthe shadow of egotism falls over our conviviality.\nThe man who hoards up anecdotes, and lets them\nloose at intervals, is a social indecency; he might\nas well strip and parade some kind of acrobatic\nfeat. See how your anecdotist lies in wait for his\nopportunity, prays for the moment that will lend\nexcuse to his \u2018That reminds me.\u2019 There is a further\npitch of shamelessness at which such a man will\nassault you openly with \u2018Have you heard this one?\u2019\nBut as long as men have some rags of behaviour left\nto them your sex, Mrs. Bredon, saves us from this\nconversational horror. When the ladies leave us,\nanecdotes flow out as from a burst dam.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because we don\u2019t know how to tell stories;\nwe don\u2019t drag them out enough. When I try to tell a\nstory I always find I have got to the point when\nI\u2019ve only just started.\u201d \u201cYou are too modest, Mrs. Bredon. It is your\nessential altruism which preserves you. You women are\nalways for helping out the conversation, not\nstrangling it at birth. You humour us men, fool us to the\ntop of our bent, yet you always restrain conversation\nfrom its worst extravagances\u2014like a low organ\naccompaniment you unobtrusively give us the note.\nAll praise to your unselfishness!\u201d \u201cI expect we are trained that way, or have trained\nourselves that way. Civilization has taught us,\nperhaps, to play up to the men.\u201d \u201cIndeed, no,\u201d chirped Mr. Pulteney, now\nthoroughly enjoying himself. \u201cConversational\nreceptivity is a natural glory of your sex. Nature itself,\nwhich bids the peacock strut to the admiration of\nthe hen, bids you evoke the intellectual powers of\nthe male. You flatter him by your attention and he\nbasks unconsciously in your approval. How much\nmore knowledge of human nature had Virgil than\nHomer! Alcinous would never have got all that long\nstory out of Ulysses; challenged by a direct\nquestion the hero would probably have admitted, in a\ngruff voice, that he had been fooling around\nsomewhere. It was a Dido that was needed to justify\nthe hysteron proteron\u2014\u2018Multa super Priamo\nrogitans, super Hectore multa\u2019\u2014she knew how to do\nit! But I become lyrical.\u201d \u201cDo please be lyrical, Mr. Pulteney. It\u2019s so good\nfor Miles; he thinks he\u2019s a strong, silent man, and\nthere\u2019s nothing more odious. The trouble is, of\ncourse, he thinks he\u2019s a kind of detective, and he\nhas to play up to the part. Look at you, Mr. Leyland,\nyou\u2019ve hardly uttered.\u201d \u201cIs this helping us out in conversation, Mrs.\nBredon? You seem to be flogging us into it.\u201d \u201cThe strong silence of the detective,\u201d explained\nthe old gentleman, \u201cis a novelists\u2019 fiction. The\nnovelist must gag his detective, or how is he to preserve\nhis secret till the last chapter? No, it is Mr.\nBrinkman who should be professionally silent; for what\nis a secretary if he does not keep secrets?\u201d \u201cI am not silent, I am silenced,\u201d said Brinkman.\n\u201cThe second best peacock dare not strut for fear of\nan encounter.\u201d \u201cI find in silence,\u201d said Bredon, \u201ca mere relief\nfrom the burden of conversation. I am grateful to\nthe man who talks, as I should be grateful to the\nman who jumped in before me to rescue a drowning\nbaby. He obviates the necessity for effort on my part.\nI sometimes think that is why I married.\u201d \u201cMiles,\u201d said Angela, \u201cif you are going to be\nodious, you will have to leave the room. I suppose\nyou think you can be rude because the detectives in\nfiction are rude? Mr. Leyland may be silent, but at\nleast he\u2019s polite.\u201d \u201cMr. Bredon is married,\u201d suggested Pulteney.\n\u201cThe caged bird does not strut. His are golden\nchains, I hasten to add, but they take the spring out\nof him none the less. For all that, I have some\ncontempt for the man who does not take his share in\nshouldering the burden of conversation. He puts\nnothing into the common pot. Mr. Brinkman, I\nresign the strutting-ground. Tell us whether you think\ndetectives should be strong, silent men or not.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t read much in that direction,\nMr. Pulteney. I should imagine it was an\nadvantage to the detective to be silent, so that he can be\nin a good position to say \u2018I told you so\u2019 when the\ntruth comes out.\u201d \u201cOh, but a detective ought to be talking all the\ntime,\u201d protested Angela. \u201cThe ones in the books\nalways are. Only what they say is always entirely\nincomprehensible, both to the other people in the\nbook and to the reader. \u2018Let me call your attention\nonce more,\u2019 they say; \u2018to the sinister significance of\nthe bend in the toast-rack,\u2019 and there you are, none\nthe wiser. Wouldn\u2019t you like to be a detective, Mr.\nPulteney?\u201d \u201cWhy, in a sense I am.\u201d There was a slight pause,\nwith several mental gasps in it, till the old\ngentleman continued, \u201cThat is to say, I am a\nschoolmaster; and the two functions are nearly akin. Who\nthrew the butter at the ceiling, which boy cribbed\nfrom which, where the missing postage-stamp has\ngot to\u2014these are the problems which agitate my\ninglorious old age. I do not know why headmasters\nallow boys to collect postage-stamps; they are\ninvariably stolen.\u201d \u201cOr why anybody wants to collect them?\u201d\nsuggested Angela. \u201cSome of them are quite pretty, of\ncourse. But I\u2019ve no patience with all this pedantry\nabout the exact date of issue and the exact shape of\nthe water-mark. But I suppose the water-mark\nhelps you in your investigations, Mr. Pulteney?\u201d \u201cI am hardly professional enough for that. I leave\nthat to the philatelist. A philatelist, by the way,\nmeans one who loves the absence of taxes. It hardly\nseems to mark out the stamp-lover from his fellows.\u201d \u201cThe detectives of fiction,\u201d put in Leyland, \u201care\nalways getting important clues from the water-mark\nof the paper on which some cryptic document is\nwritten, That is where they have the luck. If you\npick up the next four pieces of paper you see, and\nhold them up to the light, you will probably find\nthat three of them have no water-mark at all.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Angela. \u201cAnd I used to be told,\nwhen I was small, that every genuine piece of silver\nhad a lion stamped on it. But of course they haven\u2019t\nreally. I should think it\u2019s quite likely the\nwrist-watch you gave me, Miles dear, has no lion on it.\u201d\nShe took it off as she spoke. \u201cOr it must be a\nteeny-weeny one if there is.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong there, Mrs. Bredon.\u201d It was\nBrinkman who offered the correction. \u201cIf you\u2019ll\nallow me to have a look at it.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. There, up there;\nit\u2019s a little rubbed away, but it\u2019s a lion all right.\u201d \u201cI thought there always was a lion,\u201d said Bredon,\ntaking out a silver pencil-case with some presence of\nmind. \u201cYes, this has got two, one passant and one\ncabinet size.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see your watch, Mr. Leyland,\u201d suggested\nAngela, \u201cor is it electro?\u201d \u201cIt should be silver; yes, there\u2019s the little chap.\u201d\nImmediately afterward, Angela was rewarded by\nseeing Pulteney take a silver cigarette-case out of\nhis pocket, and handing it over to her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be on\nthe inside of this, I suppose? Oh, no, it\u2019s all gilt\nstuff; yes, I see, here it is on the outside.\u201d It is to\nbe feared that she added \u201cDamn!\u201d under her breath;\nthe cigarette-case had been empty. \u201cI seem to be the only poor man present,\u201d said\nBrinkman; \u201cI am all gun-metal.\u201d Angela did not trouble to influence the\nconversation further until the \u201cshape\u201d course was finished.\nThen, rather desperately, she said, \u201cDo smoke, Mr.\nLeyland, I know you\u2019re dying to. What is a\ndetective without his shag?\u201d and was rewarded by seeing\nBrinkman take out the gun-metal case and light up.\nMr. Pulteney, after verifying his own\ncigarettelessness, began slowly to fill a briar. Brinkman\u2019s cigarette, she had seen, was the last\nin the case; what if it should be the last of its box or\nof its packet? \u201cI wish I smoked,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if\nI did I would smoke a pipe; it always looks so\ncomfortable. Besides, you can shut your eyes and go to\nsleep with a pipe, which must be rather dangerous\nwith a cigarette.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d lose the taste of the pipe if you did,\u201d\nobjected Brinkman. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary thing, how\nlittle satisfaction you can get out of smoking in the\ndark.\u201d \u201cIs that really true? I\u2019ve always heard that about\ntaste depending on sight, and not being able to\ndistinguish one wine from another with one\u2019s eyes shut.\nMiles, if I put a handkerchief over your eyes, could\nyou tell your beer from Mr. Brinkman\u2019s cider? Oo,\nI say, let\u2019s try! I\u2019ll give them you in spoonfuls.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll shut my eyes, but play fair,\u201d suggested\nBredon. The idiocy of men! \u201cNo, you won\u2019t, you\u2019ll do what you\u2019re told.\nAnybody got a clean hanky? Thank you so much, Mr.\nLeyland.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. There, that\u2019s right. Now, open your\nmouth, but not too wide, or you\u2019ll choke.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nWhich was that?\u201d \u201cCider, I thought.\u201d \u201cIt was vinegar, really, with a little water in it.\u201d \u201cOh, shut up, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d Miles tore away\nthe handkerchief from his eyes. \u201cHang it all, I\nwon\u2019t strut; I\u2019m a married man!\u201d \u201cThen Mr. Brinkman shall try instead; you will,\nwon\u2019t you, Mr. Brinkman?\u201d It is to be feared that\nAngela favoured him with an appealing look; at any\nrate, he succumbed. With the instinct of the\nblindfolded man, he put his cigarette down on the edge\nof his plate. It was easy work for Angela to drop\nthe spoon, and set Mr. Pulteney grovelling for it.\nMeanwhile, she hastily picked up Brinkman\u2019s\ncigarette, and read the word \u201cCallipoli.\u201d",
        "It was Bredon and Leyland, this time, who took\ntheir evening walk together. To Bredon, events\nseemed to be closing in like a nightmare. Here\nwas he pledged to uphold the theory of suicide; and\nhe had depended largely for his success on Leyland\u2019s\ninability to produce a suitable candidate for the\nposition of murderer. But now there seemed to be a\nperfect embarras of murderers. Macbeth wasn\u2019t in it. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cat least we have something\npositive to go upon now. Brinkman\u2019s part in this\nbusiness may be what you will, but he certainly takes an\nunhealthy interest in it, to the extent of hanging\nabout round corners where he\u2019s no business to be.\nAt least we can confront him with his behaviour,\nand encourage him to make a clean breast of the\nwhole thing. I imagine you will have no objection\nto that, since it\u2019s not Brinkman you suspect of the\nmurder?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cthat\u2019s not the way\nwe go to work. The force, I mean. It\u2019s quite true\nBrinkman is not the man I have under suspicion at\nthe moment, but I\u2019m only working on a theory, and\nthat theory may prove to be a false one. I\u2019m not\ncertain of it yet, and I should have to be certain of\nit before I acquitted Brinkman.\u201d \u201cBut, hang it all, look at the question of motive.\nSimmonds, I grant you, had a reasonable motive\nfor wanting to make away with his uncle. He had\ngrounds for thinking that his uncle\u2019s death would\nmean a clear half-million to him. He had quarrelled\nwith his uncle, and thought he had been treated\nbadly. He disapproved of his uncle, and regarded\nhim as a bloodsucker. The fact that Mottram was\ndown at Chilthorpe was an excellent opportunity,\nand a rare opportunity, for young Simmonds to get\nat him. Seldom the time and the place and the hated\none all together. But your Brinkman, as far as we\ncan see, was only affected by the death in the sense\nthat he has lost a good job and has now to look out\nfor another one, with no late employer to supply\nhim with testimonials. Personally, I believe\nBrinkman did know about the alteration in the will; at\nleast he knew about the uncertainty of Mottram\u2019s\nhealth. Can you suppose that, even if Simmonds\noffered to go halves with him, he would consent to\nbe an accomplice in what might prove a wholly\nunnecessary crime?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re assuming too much. We don\u2019t know yet\nthat Brinkman has no financial interest in the\naffair. Look here\u2014this is far-fetched, I grant you, but\nit\u2019s not impossible: Everybody says Mottram had\nno family; whose word have they for that except\nhis own? Where did he pick up Brinkman? No one\nknows. Why did he want a secretary? There was\nsome talk of writing a history of Pullford, but\nnothing ever came of it. Why, then, this curious\ninterest which Mottram takes in Brinkman? I don\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s likely, but I say it\u2019s possible that Brinkman\nis Mottram\u2019s son by a clandestine marriage. If\nthat\u2019s so, and if Brinkman didn\u2019t know about the\ncodicil, he may himself be the next of kin who is\npreparing to step into the half-million. And a clever\nman\u2014Brinkman is a clever man\u2014might find it\nconvenient to get Mottram out of the way, and get\nsome one else to do it for him. He is afraid that\nMottram will live to be sixty-five, and the policy\nwill leave no benefits behind it. Or he is afraid that\nMottram is going to make a new will. What does\nhe do? Why, he goes to Simmonds, and points out\nto him that as the next of kin he would score by\nputting Mottram through it. Simmonds does so,\nall unsuspecting; and here\u2019s Brinkman, only\nwaiting to step in and claim the half-million on the\nstrength of his mother\u2019s marriage-lines!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too confoundedly ingenious. Things don\u2019t\nhappen like that.\u201d \u201cThings have happened like that before now, and\nwith less than half a million to give grounds for\nthem. No, I\u2019m not going to leave Brinkman out of\nmy calculations, and therefore I\u2019m not going to\ntake him into my confidence. But this\neavesdropping of his does give us a very important chance,\nand we\u2019re going to use it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite see how.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not a professional, and\nyou don\u2019t know the way things are done in the force.\nThe outside public doesn\u2019t, and we don\u2019t mean it\nto. We don\u2019t show our workings. But half, or say a\nthird at least, of the big businesses we clear up are\ncleared up by bluff, by leading the suspected man\non and encouraging him to give himself away.\nSometimes it isn\u2019t a very pretty business, of course; we\nhave to use agents who are none too scrupulous.\nBut here we\u2019ve got a ready-made chance of bluffing\nour man, and bluffing him into betraying himself.\u201d \u201cHow, exactly?\u201d \u201cYou and I are going to meet again in that\nmill-house. And we are going to talk about it openly\nbeforehand, so that we can be jolly sure Brinkman\nwill creep up behind and listen to us. And when\nwe\u2019ve got him comfortably fixed there listening to\nus, you and I are going to lead him up the garden.\nWe are going to make him overhear something\nwhich is really meant for his ears, though he thinks\nit\u2019s meant for anybody\u2019s ears rather than his own.\u201d \u201cOh, I see\u2014a fake conversation. I say, I\u2019m not\nmuch of an actor. Angela would do it far better than\nI should.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no acting wanted. All you\u2019ve got to do\nis to sit there and argue pigheadedly about it\u2019s being\nsuicide, the same as you always do. Meanwhile,\nI\u2019ll do the fake part\u2014or rather, it won\u2019t be much\nof a fake, either. I shall repeat what I told you\nyesterday, about suspecting Simmonds. That\u2019s all\ntrue enough; I do suspect the man; though I wish\nhe wasn\u2019t so confoundedly innocent and self-possessed\nunder examination. Then I shall say that\nI also suspect Brinkman\u2014not letting on, of course,\nabout the cigarette and all that, but putting up\nsome ground or other for suspicion. Simmonds, I\nshall say, is clearly the murderer, but I\u2019ve reason\nto think Brinkman knows more about it than he\nought to do. I shall say that I\u2019m going to have\nBrinkman shadowed, and that I\u2019m going to get a\nwarrant for his arrest. At the same time, I shall\nsay I think he\u2019s a fool not to own up, if his share\nin the business is not a guilty one. And so on.\nThen we just wait and see how Brinkman reacts.\u201d \u201cI should think he\u2019d skip.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I want him to do. Of course, I\u2019ve\ngot him shadowed already. If he makes a determined\nbolt for it that gives me reasonable ground for\nputting him under arrest.\u201d \u201cWhat else can he do?\u201d \u201cWell, if he\u2019s relatively innocent, he might\nconfide in you about it.\u201d \u201cOh, I see, that\u2019s the game. Damn it, why did I\never consent to become a spy? Leyland, I don\u2019t like\nthis job. It\u2019s too\u2014too underhand.\u201d \u201cWell, you were an intelligence officer, weren\u2019t\nyou? There was no trick you wouldn\u2019t play, while\nthe war was on, to beat the Germans. Why should\nyou be more squeamish about it when you\u2019ve the\nwell-being of society to consider? Your job is to\nprotect the interests of all the honest men who\u2019ve\ninsured with your company. My business is to see\nthat harmless people don\u2019t get gassed in their sleep.\nIn any case, we\u2019ve got to get at the truth. I might\neven point out that we\u2019ve got a bet on it.\u201d \u201cBut look here, if Brinkman confides in me, am\nI to betray his confidence? That hardly seems\ncricket.\u201d \u201cWell, if you\u2019re not a fool, you\u2019d better avoid\nmaking any promise of secrecy. You must act up\nto your own confounded conscience, I suppose. But\nremember, Brinkman can\u2019t get away; I\u2019ve got him\nwatched all right. If his part in the show is quite an\ninnocent one, you\u2019d better point out to him that his\nbest plan is to make a clean breast of it.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll help you bait the trap. If Brinkman\ncomes to me about it, I can\u2019t answer for what I\u2019ll\ndo\u2014unless you subp\u0153na me, of course. By the\nway, what happens if Brinkman doesn\u2019t react at\nall? If he simply does nothing about it?\u201d \u201cWe shall be just where we were before. But I\nthink if we give him a lead he\u2019s almost certain to\ntake it. After all, there\u2019s no reason why he should\nstay on here, but he hasn\u2019t shown any signs of\nmoving yet. Once the funeral\u2019s over, he\u2019ll be anxious\nto put things straight, if only to get a fresh job.\u201d By now they were on their return journey, on\nthe road leading down the valley; the twilight was\ngathering, but the few street-lamps which Chilthorpe\nafforded had not yet been lit. It was but natural\nthat on a summer evening such a road as this should\nbe a trysting-place of lovers. There is a sentimental\nstreak in all our natures which warns us that a\nyoung man and a young woman sharing a railway\ncarriage must be left to share it; and equally that\na pair of lovers in a lane must be passed by as\nhastily as possible, with no inquisitive looks thrown\nin their direction. It is our instinct thus to\npropitiate the Paphian Queen. It was characteristic\nof Bredon that, as he passed one of these couples\nfrom behind, seeing their heads close together in\nearnest colloquy, he quickened his pace and never\nlooked backward. It was equally characteristic of\nLeyland that, although he too quickened his pace,\nhe did let his eye rest on the pair for a\nmoment\u2014lightly, it seemed, and uncomprehendingly. But\nwhen they were out of earshot he shewed that his\nhad been no casual glance. \u201cYou saw them, Bredon,\neh? You saw them?\u201d \u201cI saw there were some people there. I didn\u2019t\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t do to miss these\nthings. The young lady is the barmaid at our hotel,\nthe lady who always says \u2018Raight-ho!\u2019 when you ask\nfor anything. And the young man is our friend Mr.\nSimmonds. It looks as if a m\u00e9salliance were in\ncontemplation, from the Simmonds point of view. And\nit means\u2014well, it may mean almost anything.\u201d \u201cOr almost nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, if you ask me, it seems to be a matter\nof importance to know that Simmonds has got his\nfoot inside the door, so to speak, at the Load of\nMischief. He had somebody there to let him in and\nlet him out late at night. He had somebody to cover\nhis traces, if necessary, when the crime was over.\nI think our nets are beginning to close at last.\u201d \u201cLike to hide behind the hedge and listen to what\nthey\u2019re saying?\u201d \u201cWhy, it might be done. But it seemed to me\nthey had their voices lowered all the time, not\nmerely while we were passing. No, I think it\u2019s the\nbar parlour for me.\u201d Angela was far more enthusiastic than her\nhusband over the proposed ambush. \u201cYou see, Brinky\ncan\u2019t really be a very nice man, or he wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen listening at our keyhole. Just think, I might\nhave been ticking you off about your table manners\nor something. No, if he will go and hide in the\narras he must take what he gets, like Polonius. And,\nafter all, if he does come to you afterward, and\nwants to sob on your bosom, you can always refuse\nto promise secrecy. The world would be such a\nmuch happier place if people wouldn\u2019t make\npromises.\u201d \u201cNone at all?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be soppy. You aren\u2019t in the lovers\u2019 lane\nnow. Meanwhile, I think it would be a good thing\nif you overcame your natural bonhomie, and had a\ntalk with Mr. Simmonds to-morrow. The more\nnecessary, since you only seem to have brought three\nhankies here, and it\u2019s you for the haberdasher\u2019s\nin any case.\u201d \u201cAll right; but you mustn\u2019t come. You cramp\nmy style in shops. Too much of the\nI-want-a-handkerchief-for-this-young-gentleman business about\nyou.\u201d \u201cThen I shall console myself by talking to the\nbarmaid, and finding out if she\u2019s capable of saying\nanything except \u2018Raight-ho.\u2019 Of course I knew she\nhad a young man all the time.\u201d \u201cRot! How could you tell?\u201d \u201cMy dear Miles, no girl ever waits so badly as\nthat, or tosses her head like that, unless she\u2019s\nmeaning to chuck up her job almost immediately. I\ndeduced a young man.\u201d \u201cI wonder you haven\u2019t wormed yourself into her\nconfidence already.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t interested in her. But to-night, at\nsupper, she was jumpy\u2014even you must have noticed\nit. She almost dropped the soup-plates, and the\n\u2018shape\u2019 was quivering like a guilty thing surprised.\u201d \u201cThat was your dressing for dinner.\u201d \u201cBunkum! You must have seen that she was all\non edge. Anyhow, we\u2019re going to have a\nheart-to-heart talk.\u201d \u201cAll right. Don\u2019t bully the wretched girl, though.\u201d \u201cMiles! You really mustn\u2019t go running after every\nwoman you meet like this. I shall deal with her\nwith all my well-known delicacy and tact. Look how\nI managed them at supper! I should have cried, I\nthink, if I\u2019d found it was Edward who smoked the\nCallipoli. Do you think Leyland has still got his\nknife into Simmonds? Or do you think he wants to\narrest Brinky, and is only using Simmonds as a\nblind?\u201d \u201cHe was excited enough when we met Simmonds\nin the lane. No, I think he\u2019s out to arrest\neverybody at the moment; Simmonds for doing the\nmurder, and Brinkman for persuading him or helping\nhim to do it. He\u2019s got \u2019em both shadowed, anyhow,\nhe says\u2014I hope not by the Chilthorpe police, who\nlook to me too substantial to be mistaken for\nshadows. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019m right, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m\nright.\u201d \u201cOf course you are. Though, mind you, it looks\nto me as if Mottram had only just managed to\ncommit suicide in time to avoid being murdered. The\ntrouble about Leyland\u2019s Simmonds theory is that\nit makes the little man too clever. I don\u2019t believe\nLeyland could ever catch a criminal unless he were\na superhumanly clever criminal, and of course so\nfew of them are. They go and make one rotten little\nmistake, and so get caught out.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re getting too clever. It\u2019s quite time you\nwent to bed.\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018Raight-ho,\u2019 as your friend the barmaid says.\nNo, don\u2019t stamp about and pretend to be a\ncaveman. Go downstairs like a good boy, and help\nLeyland incriminate the oldest inhabitant. He\u2019ll be\ngetting to that soon.\u201d",
        "The sun rose bright the next morning, as if it\nhad heard there was a funeral in contemplation\nand was determined to be there. The\nparty at the Load of Mischief rose considerably\nlater, and more or less coincided at the breakfast\ntable. \u201cI am afraid we shall be losing you,\u201d said\nMr. Pulteney to Angela. \u201cA fortunate crime\nprivileged us with your presence; when the mortal\nremains of it have been put away I suppose that your\nhusband\u2019s work here is done? Unless, of course,\nMrs. Davis\u2019s eggs and bacon have determined you\nto stay on here as a holiday.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know what we are doing, Mr.\nPulteney. My husband, of course, will have to write\na report for those tiresome people at the office, and\nthat will take a little time. Why do men always take\na whole day to write a report? I don\u2019t suppose we\nshall be leaving till to-morrow in any case. Perhaps\nyou will have caught a fish by then.\u201d \u201cIf you would only consent to stay till that\nhappens we should all congratulate ourselves. But,\nseriously, it will be a deprivation. I came to this hotel\nfeeling that I was foredoomed to solitude, or the\ncompany, now and again, of a stray bagman.\nInstead, I have found the place a feast of reason; and\nI shall regret the change.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll still have Mr. Brinkman.\u201d \u201cWhat is Brinkman? A man who cannot tell beer\nfrom cider with his eyes shut\u2014Ah, here he is! I\nhave been lamenting the loss Mr. and Mrs. Bredon\nwill be to our desert island. But you too, I suppose,\nwill be for Pullford again before the funeral\nbake-meats are cold?\u201d \u201cMe? Oh, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. My plans are\nrather vague. The house at Pullford is almost shut\nup, everybody except the housekeeper away. I\ndaresay I shall stay on a bit. And then, I suppose, go to\nLondon to look for another job.\u201d \u201cWith better auspices, I hope. Well, you deserve a\nrest before you settle down to the collar again.\nTalking of collars\u201d (he addressed himself to the\nbarmaid, who had just come in with more eggs and\nbacon), \u201cI wonder if you could represent to Mrs.\nDavis the desirability of sending some of my clothes\nto the wash?\u201d \u201cRaight-ho,\u201d said the barmaid, unconcernedly. \u201cI thank you; you gratify my least whim. Ah,\nhere is Mr. Leyland! I trust you have slept off the\nweariness induced by the Coroner\u2019s allocution\nyesterday?\u201d \u201cQuite, thanks,\u201d said Leyland, grinning.\n\u201cGood-morning, Mrs. Bredon. Good-morning, Bredon; I\nwonder if you could give me ten minutes or a\nquarter of an hour after breakfast?\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. No, no\nporridge, thanks; just eggs and bacon.\u201d \u201cYes, rather. We might stroll back to the\nmill-house, if you don\u2019t mind, for I rather think I\ndropped a packet of pipe-papers there. In fact, I\nthink I\u2019ll go on there and wait for you. No hurry.\u201d It was some twenty minutes before Leyland\nturned up, and almost at the moment of his arrival\nboth men heard a very faint click behind them, as if\nsomebody on the further side of the wall, in walking\ngently, had dislodged a loose stone. They exchanged\nan instantaneous glance, then Leyland opened up\nthe pre-arranged conversation. There was something\ncuriously uncanny about this business of talking\nentirely for the benefit of a concealed audience, but\nthey both carried off the situation creditably. \u201cWell,\u201d began Bredon, \u201cyou\u2019re still hunting for\nmurderers?\u201d \u201cFor a murderer, to be accurate. It doesn\u2019t take\ntwo men to turn on a gas-jet. And when I say I\u2019m\nhunting for him, I\u2019m not exactly doing that; I\u2019m\nhunting him. The motive\u2019s clear enough, and the\nmethod\u2019s clear enough, apart from details, but I\nwant to make my case a little stronger before I take\nany action.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve applied for a warrant, you say?\u201d \u201cAgainst Simmonds, yes. At least, I wrote last\nnight; though of course with the posts we have here\nit won\u2019t reach London till this evening, and probably\nlate this evening. Meanwhile, I keep him under\nobservation.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still sure he\u2019s your man?\u201d \u201cI can hardly imagine a stronger case. There\u2019s\nthe motive present, and a good motive too, half a\nmillion pounds. There\u2019s the disposition, a natural\nresentment against his uncle for treating him hardly,\nadded to a conscientious objection to his great\nwealth and the means by which he made it. There\u2019s\nthe threat: that letter of \u2018Brutus\u2019 will tell in a law\ncourt, if I know anything of juries. There\u2019s the\noccasion: the fact of Mottram happening to be down\nat Chilthorpe. There\u2019s the facility: we know that he\nwas hand in glove with the barmaid, who could let\nhim in at any hour of the day or night, who could\nfurther his schemes and cover his traces. Finally,\nthere is the actual coincidence of his whereabouts: I\ncan bring testimony to prove that he was hanging\nround the Load of Mischief at a time when all\nhonest teetotallers ought to be in bed. There\u2019s only one\nthing more that I want, and only one thing on the\nother side that would make me hold my hand.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing you want?\u201d \u201cDefinite evidence to connect him with the actual\nroom in which Mottram was sleeping. If he\u2019d\ndropped anything there, so much as a match-head;\nif he\u2019d left even a finger-mark about anywhere, I\u2019d\nhave the noose round his neck. But if you haven\u2019t\ngot just that last detail of evidence juries are often\nslow to convict. I could tell you of murderers who\nare at large now simply because we couldn\u2019t actually\nconnect them with the particular scene of the crime\nor with the particular weapon the crime was\ncommitted with.\u201d Bredon could not help admiring the man. It was\nobvious that he was still allowing for the possibility\nof Brinkman\u2019s guilt and was accordingly advising\nBrinkman, whom he knew to be hidden round the\ncorner, to manufacture some clue which would point\nto Simmonds, and thereby to give himself away.\nBredon could not help wondering whether this was\nthe real purpose of the colloquy, and whether he\nhimself was not being kept in the dark. However,\nhe had his sailing orders, and continued to play up to\nthem. \u201cAnd the one thing which would make you hold\nyour hand?\u201d \u201cWhy, if I could get satisfactory proof that\nSimmonds knew of the existence of that codicil. You see,\nwe know that Simmonds did not stand to gain\nanything by murdering his uncle, because, in fact, his\nuncle had signed away all his expectations to the\nBishop of Pullford. Now, if I could feel certain that\nSimmonds knew where he stood; knew that there\nwas nothing coming to him as next of kin\u2014why,\nthen the motive would be gone, and with the motive\nmy suspicions. The fact that he disliked his uncle,\nthe fact that he disapproved of his uncle, wouldn\u2019t\nmake him murder his uncle. It\u2019s a humiliating fact,\nbut you don\u2019t ever get a crime of this sort without\nsome quid pro quo in the form of hard cash. If I felt\nsure that Simmonds knew he was cut out of the will\naltogether, then I\u2019d acquit him, or be prepared to\nacquit him. If, on the other hand, somebody could\nproduce good reason for thinking that Simmonds\nwas expecting to profit by his uncle\u2019s will, then\nmy case would be proportionately strengthened.\u201d Once more Bredon listened with admiration. The\nman who was concealed behind the wall had been\nMottram\u2019s own secretary, more likely than any other\nman living to know how the facts stood. And\nLeyland was appealing to him, if he had any relevant\nknowledge about Simmonds\u2019s expectations, to\nproduce it; if he had none, to forge it, and thereby give\nhimself away. The game began to thrill him in spite\nof himself. \u201cAnd meanwhile, what of our other friend?\u201d \u201cBrinkman? Well, as I told you, I don\u2019t suspect\nBrinkman directly. He had no motive for the crime,\nas far as we can see. But he is not playing the game,\nand for the life of me I can\u2019t think why. For\ninstance, he has been ready from the first to back up\nyour idea of suicide. In fact, it seems to have been\nhe who first mentioned the word suicide in connexion\nwith this business. He told you, for example, that\nhe thought Dr. Ferrers must have shut off the main\ngas-jet by accident. He said, I think you told me, that\nit was very loose. As a matter of fact, it was very\nstiff at the time, and he must have known that it\nwas stiff; for it was he who borrowed a pair of\npinchers for me when I wanted to loosen it. And there\nare some other bits of evidence which I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m\nnot at liberty to mention to you, which make me look\naskance at Brinkman\u2019s behaviour. He\u2019s hiding\nsomething, but what?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see what good he can be doing himself\nby holding back.\u201d \u201cPrecisely. I don\u2019t want to injure the fellow, but\nI must get at the truth. I\u2019m writing to-night for a\nwarrant; not because I think he\u2019s the guilty man\nbut because we must get his evidence somehow, and\nI think a taste of prison detention might make him\nspeak out. But of course it\u2019s bad luck on the fellow,\nbecause a record like that, however much he is\ncleared, is bound to count against him when he looks\nout for a new job. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s shielding\nMottram\u2019s reputation, or it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s\nafraid of coming under suspicion himself, or it\u2019s\npossible that he\u2019s simply lost his head, and, having\nno one to consult, can\u2019t make up his mind what to\ndo. But he\u2019s cutting his own throat; there\u2019s no doubt\nabout that. I can\u2019t think he\u2019s really guilty, or why\nhasn\u2019t he skipped? For all we could do, he could be\nin Vienna in a couple of days, and we none the\nwiser. Yet he stays on, and stays on as if there\nwas some end to be gained by it.\u201d \u201cBut if he went off you could arrest him on\nsuspicion, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cCould I? Hardly on what I know at present. I\u2019m\nlooking forward, you see, to Simmonds\u2019s evidence\nwhen he\u2019s arrested. I know that type, an\u00e6mic,\nnervous; once he\u2019s arrested, with any luck, we can make\nhim tell us the whole story; and then, if Brinkman\nreally has been up to anything, it will be too late\nfor him to get clear. But, as I say, I don\u2019t believe\nBrinkman is a wrong \u2019un. If only he\u2019d have the\nsense to confide in me\u2014or in you, if he\u2019s afraid of\nthe police.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Well, I wanted to tell you all this,\nso that you\u2019ll know where you are in dealing with\nSimmonds. Mrs. Bredon told me you were hoping to\nget a look at him to-day.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the idea. To tell the truth, I think I\u2019d\nbetter be starting now, because it\u2019s easier to have\na private interview with him if I go into the shop\nbefore the rush hour begins. Not that the rush hour\nat Chilthorpe is likely to be very formidable, but I\ndon\u2019t want to have our t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate interrupted by old\nladies matching ribbons.\u201d Bredon strolled off. Leyland stayed where he was\ntill he guessed the coast would be clear, and then\nwent cautiously round to the back of the building.\nHe found what he had expected, and hoped for. The\ncigarette, which they had left the night before in\nthe place where it lay, had by now been carefully\nremoved. When Bredon reached the shop he found that\nFortune was smiling on him. There seemed to be only\none attendant about besides Simmonds himself, and\nthis was a freckled, sandy-haired youth who was\ncleaning the front windows with every appearance of\ndeliberation. Nor were there any rival shoppers so\nearly on a Chilthorpe morning. Mr. Simmonds\napproached the handkerchief question with the air of\nbeing just the right man to come to. Other things,\nyou felt, were to be bought in this shop: teethers,\nfor example, and walking-sticks, and liquorice, and\nso on. But when you came to handkerchiefs, there\nyou had found a specialist, a man who had handled\nhandkerchiefs these fifteen years past. Something\nstylish, perhaps, was required? This with a glance\nat the customer, as if to size him up and recognise\nthe man of taste. \u201cThe plain ones? Just plain white,\nyou mean, sir? Well, it\u2019s a curious thing, but I\u2019m\nnot certain I can lay my hand on one of them. You\nsee, there\u2019s more demand for the coloured ones, a\nbit of edging, anyhow. And, you see, we haven\u2019t\ngot in our new stock yet.\u201d (They never have got in\ntheir new stock yet at Simmonds\u2019s.) \u201cThree weeks\nago I could have done you a very good line in the\nplain ones, but I\u2019m rather afraid we\u2019re right out.\nI\u2019ll just see.\u201d This was followed by an avalanche of drawers,\ncontaining handkerchiefs of every conceivable\nvariety that was not plain. A violent horseshoe pattern\nthat ran through all the gamut of the colours; a\nkind of willow pattern; a humorous series featuring\nfilm stars; striped edges, spotted edges, check\nedges\u2014but no plain. From time to time Mr. Simmonds\nwould draw attention to the merits of the exhibits,\nas if it were just his luck that his customer should\nbe a man so unadventurous in taste. \u201cNow, that\u2019s\na very good number; you couldn\u2019t get a better line\nthan that, not if it was a coloured handkerchief you\nwere wanting.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. No, no, sir, no trouble at all;\nI daresay perhaps I may be able to lay my hand on\nthe article you require.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You don\u2019t fancy those,\nnow? Those come very cheap because they\u2019re\nbankrupt stock. Just you feel that, sir, and see what a lot\nof wear there is in it!\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Yes, that\u2019s right, they\u2019re\na little on the gay side, sir, but we don\u2019t get any\nreal demand, not for the plain ones; people don\u2019t\nseem to fancy them nowadays. Mind you, if you\u2019ll\nbe staying on here for a day or two, I could get you\nsome; we shall be sending into Pullford the day\nafter to-morrow. But at the moment we seem to be\nright out of them.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Oh, you\u2019ll take the check\nones\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. half a dozen? Thank you, sir; you\u2019ll find\nthey\u2019re a very good line; you could go a long way\nand not find another handkerchief just like that one.\nIt\u2019s a handkerchief we\u2019ve stocked many years now,\nand never had any difficulty in getting rid of it. And\nthe next article, please?\u201d But Bredon did not meditate any more purchases.\nHe had begun to realize that in Chilthorpe you\nbought not the thing you wanted but the thing Mr.\nSimmonds had in stock. While the handkerchiefs\nwere being wrapped, he sat down on a high,\nuncomfortable chair close to the counter, and opened\nconversation about the deceased. Simmonds might\nhave quarrelled with his uncle, but surely he would\ntake the gloomy pride of the uneducated in his near\nrelationship to a corpse. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve had a sad loss, Mr.\nSimmonds.\u201d Now, why did the man suddenly turn a white,\nhaggard face toward his visitor, starting as if the\nremark had been something out of the way? There\nwas no secret about the relationship; it had been\nmentioned publicly at the inquest. Leyland had\ninsisted that in all his interviews with Simmonds he\nhad failed to observe any sign of discomposure. Yet\nthis morning a mere allusion to Mottram seemed to\nthrow his nephew all out of gear. The cant phrases\nof his craft had flowed from him mechanically\nenough, but once his customer began to talk the\ngossip of the village all the self-possession fell from\nhim like a mask, and he stood pale and quivering. \u201cAs you say, sir. Very melancholy event. My\nuncle, sir, he was. Oh, yes, sir. We didn\u2019t see him\nmuch down here\u2014we hadn\u2019t anything to do with\nhim, sir. We didn\u2019t get on very well\u2014what I mean\nis, he didn\u2019t think much of me. No, sir. But he was\nmy uncle, sir. Over in Pullford he lived; hasn\u2019t\nlived here for many years now, though it was his\nown place.\u201d \u201cStill, blood\u2019s thicker than water, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir? Oh, I see what you mean; yes,\nsir. I\u2019m seeing to the funeral and all that. Excuse me\none moment, sir. Sam! Just take a pair of steps and\nput them boxes back, there\u2019s a good lad. And there\u2019s\nnothing else to-day, sir?\u201d There was nothing else. Bredon had meant to say\na good deal, but he had reckoned on dealing with a\nsmug, self-possessed tradesman, who might\nunsuspectingly drop a few hints that were worth knowing.\nInstead, he found a man who started at shadows,\nwho was plainly alive with panic. He went back to\nhis hotel full of disquiet; there went his twenty\npounds, and the company\u2019s half-million. And yet,\nwhat did it all mean? Why did Simmonds tremble in\nthe presence of Bredon when he had shewn no trace\nof embarrassment in talking to Leyland, who was\nan official of the police? The whole tangle of events\nseemed to become more complicated with every\neffort that was made to unravel it.",
        "In front of the Load of Mischief stands an\nale-house bench\u2014that is the description which\nleaps to the mind. Ideally, it should be occupied\nby an old gaffer in a white smock, drinking cider\nand smoking a churchwarden. A really progressive\nhotel would hire a gaffer by the day to do it. A less\nappropriate advertisement, yet creditable enough to\nthe establishment in the bright air of the June\nmorning, Angela was occupying this seat as her husband\ncame back from his shopping; she was knitting in\na nice, old-fashioned way, but spoilt the effect of\nit rather by whistling as she did so. \u201cWell, did you get a bargain?\u201d she asked. \u201cSo I am assured. I have got a very good line; I\ncould go a long way and not find another\nhandkerchief just like this one. Or indeed six other\nhandkerchiefs just like these six. They are distinctive,\nthat is the great point. Even you, Angela, will have\ndifficulty in getting them lost at the wash.\u201d \u201cAnd how was Mr. Simmonds?\u201d asked Angela,\ndropping her voice. Bredon looked round cautiously. But Angela had\nchosen her place well; she knew that publicity is the\nsurest safeguard of privacy. In the open square in\nfront of the inn nobody would suppose that you\nwere exchanging anything but trivialities. Bredon\ncommunicated his mystification and his alarm,\ndepicting the strange behaviour of that haberdasher\nin terms that left no room for doubt. \u201cYes,\u201d said Angela when he had finished, \u201cyou\nwere quite right not to press him with any more\nquestions. You do seem to be rather heavy-handed,\nsomehow, over these personal jobs. Now, I\u2019ve been\nhaving it out with \u2018Raight-ho\u2019 since breakfast, and\nI got quite a lot out of her. Miles, that girl\u2019s a jewel.\nIf she wasn\u2019t going to be married, I\u2019d get her to\ncome to Burrington, in spite of your well-known\nsusceptibility. But it\u2019s no use; the poor girl is\ndetermined to sign away her liberty.\u201d \u201cTo Mr. Simmonds?\u201d \u201cSo I gather from what Mr. Leyland told me last\nnight. But of course I was far too discreet to ask\nfor any names.\u201d \u201cHow did you manage to worm yourself into her\nconfidence? I\u2019d as soon tackle a stone wall.\u201d \u201cOne must unbend. It\u2019s easier for us women. By a\nsudden inspiration, I reflected that it must be an\nawful nuisance washing up all those plates after\nbreakfast, especially in a pub where they seldom\nhave more than two guests at a time. So I offered\nto help. That was just about the time you went out\nshopping. I\u2019m quite good at washing up plates, you\nknow, thanks to having married beneath me. She\nsaid \u2018Raight-ho,\u2019 and we adjourned to the scullery,\nwhere I did wonders. In the scullery I saw a copy\nof Home Hints, which was very important.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite see why.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you remember that cantankerous old\nbachelor friend of yours who came to us once in\nLondon\u2014Soames, I think his name was\u2014who told\nus that he wrote the column headed \u2018Cupid\u2019s\nLabyrinth\u2019? The column that gives advice to\ncorrespondents, you know, about affairs of the heart. It\u2019s the\ngreatest mistake in the world to suppose that the\nmodern pillion-girl is any less soppy about her\namours than the young misses of last century. I\nknew instinctively that \u2018Raight-ho\u2019\u2014her name, by\nthe way, is Emmeline, poor thing\u2014was an avid\nreader of \u2018Cupid\u2019s Labyrinth.\u2019 And I\u2019m afraid I\nrather prevaricated.\u201d \u201cAngela, you surprise me. What particular form\nof lie did you blacken your soul with this time?\u201d \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t exactly say anything. But I\nsomehow allowed her to get the impression that it was I\nwho did the column. After all, Mr. Soames is a\nfriend of yours, so it wasn\u2019t so very far from the\ntruth. Miles, she rose to the bait like anything.\u201d \u201cHeaven forgive you! Well, go on.\u201d \u201cIt was all to save you twenty quid, after all. Up\ntill then, she\u2019d been saying all the ordinary\nthings\u2014she\u2019d got a sister in London, whom she goes and\nstays with; and she finds Chilthorpe rather slow,\nhardly ever going to the pictures and that; and she\u2019d\nlike to get up to London herself\u2014it\u2019s what they all\nsay. But when I let on that I was Aunt Daphne of\n\u2018Cupid\u2019s Labyrinth,\u2019 she spread herself. How would\nI advise a friend of hers to act who found herself\nin a very delicate situation? So I told her to cough\nit up. The friend, it seemed, had been walking out\nwith a young man who was quite decently off; that\nis, he had quite enough to marry on. But one day he\nexplained to her that he had expectations of\nbecoming really very rich; if only a relation of his would\ndie, he would then come into a property far above\nhis own station, let alone hers.\u201d \u201cThe situation sounds arresting in more ways than\none.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt. Well, the man suggested they\nshould get engaged, and they did, only on the quiet.\nAnd then, a few weeks ago, or it might have been\na fortnight ago, this man suddenly informed her\nfriend that all his dreams of wealth had suddenly\ncollapsed. The rich relation had made a new will\nin which he made no provision for his family.\nAnd he, the young man, was very nice about it;\nand said of course he\u2019d asked her to marry him\nat a time when he thought he could make her a rich\nwoman; and now he couldn\u2019t. So if she wanted to\nback out of the engagement now, he would give her\ncomplete liberty.\u201d \u201cSportsman.\u201d \u201cHer friend indignantly said \u2018No\u2019; she wouldn\u2019t\ndream of backing out. She wanted to marry him for\nhimself, not for his money, and all that. So they are\ncontinuing to regard the engagement as a fixture.\nBut her difficulty, I mean the friend\u2019s difficulty,\nis this: was it just a sort of melodramatic\ninstinct which made her say that the money meant\nnothing to her? Was it just her pride which made\nher think she was still in love with the man, now\nthat he was no longer an heir? Or was she really still\nin love with him? That was the problem, and I had\nto set to and answer it.\u201d \u201cAnd what was your answer?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s hardly important, is it? Of course, I\nput on my best Aunt Daphne manner, and tried to\nthink of the sort of tripe Soames would have\nwritten. It wasn\u2019t difficult, really. I said that if the man\nwas quite comfortably off as it was, it was\nprobably far better for them both that they shouldn\u2019t\nbecome enormously rich; and I laid it on thick about\nthe deceitfulness of riches, though I wish I\u2019d more\nexperience of it, don\u2019t you? And I said if they were\nalready walking out before the man mentioned\nanything about the legacy, that proved that her friend\nwas already in love with him, or half in love with\nhim, before the question of money cropped up at\nall. And I told her I thought her friend would be\nvery happy with the man, probably all the happier\nbecause he knew that she wasn\u2019t mercenary in her\nambitions, and all that sort of thing\u2014I felt rather\na beast doing it. She was very grateful, and it didn\u2019t\nseem to occur to her for a moment that she was\ngiving herself away, horse, foot and guns. She\ncan\u2019t have known, obviously, that you and Leyland\nwere rubbering in the lane last night. And so there\nit is.\u201d \u201cAnd confoundedly important at that. Angela, you\nare a trump! We\u2019ve got Leyland down, both ears\ntouching. He himself said that his theory about\nSimmonds would break down if it could be proved\nthat Simmonds did know about the codicil, did\nknow that he\u2019d been cut out of the will. And it can\nbe proved; we can prove it! It\u2019s too much of a\ncoincidence, isn\u2019t it, that all this should have happened\na fortnight ago or thereabouts? Obviously, it was\nhearing about the codicil which made Simmonds\noffer to free \u2018Raight-ho\u2019 from her engagement, and\njolly sporting of him, I consider.\u201d \u201cCandour compels me to admit that I\u2019ve been\nrather efficient. But, Miles dear, the thing doesn\u2019t\nmake sense yet. We know now that Simmonds wasn\u2019t\nexpecting anything from his uncle\u2019s will, and\ntherefore had no motive for murdering him, unless it was\nmere spite. Then, why has Simmonds got the wind\nup so badly? You aren\u2019t as frightening as all that.\u201d \u201cYes; it still looks as if Simmonds had got\nsomething on his mind. And we know that Brinkman\u2019s\ngot something on his mind. Perhaps Brinkman will\nreact on this morning\u2019s conversation and let us\nknow a little more about it.\u201d Almost as he spoke, Brinkman came out from the\ndoor of the inn. He came straight up to Bredon as\nif he had been looking for him, and said, \u201cOh, Mr.\nBredon, I was wondering if you would care to come\nfor a bit of a walk. I shall get no exercise this\nafternoon, with the funeral to attend, and I thought\nperhaps you\u2019d like a turn round the gorge. It\u2019s\nconsidered rather a local feature, and you oughtn\u2019t to\nleave without seeing it.\u201d It was clumsily done. He seemed to ignore\nAngela\u2019s presence, and pointedly excluded her, with\nhis eyes, from the invitation. It seemed evident that\nthe man was determined on a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Angela\u2019s\nglance betrayed a surprise which she did not feel,\nand perhaps a pique which she did, but she rose to\nthe occasion. \u201cDo take him out, Mr. Brinkman.\nHe\u2019s getting dreadfully fat down here. Instead of\ntaking exercise, he comes out and chats to me in\npublic, more like a friend than a husband\u2014and\nhe\u2019s making me drop my stitches.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d asked Bredon, with a\nwholly unnecessary wink. \u201cNot if I know it. I\u2019m not dressed for gorge\ninspecting. You may buy me a picture post-card of it,\nif you like, on the way back.\u201d The two strolled off up the valley. Bredon\u2019s heart\nbeat fast. It was evident that Brinkman was taking\nadvantage of the overheard conversation, and was\npreparing to make some kind of disclosure. Was he\nat last on the track of the secret? Well, he must\nbe careful not to betray himself by any leading\nquestions. The post of the amiable incompetent,\nwhich he had already sustained with Brinkman,\nwould do well enough. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine thing, the gorge,\u201d said Brinkman. \u201cIt\nlies just below the Long Pool; but fortunately\nPulteney isn\u2019t fishing the Long Pool to-day, so we\nshan\u2019t be shouted at and told to keep away from\nthe bank. I really think, apart from the fishing,\nChilthorpe is worth seeing, just for the gorge. Do\nyou know anything about geology and such things?\u201d \u201cYou can search me. Beats me how they do it.\u201d \u201cIt beats me how the stream does it. Here\u2019s a\nlittle trickle of water that can\u2019t shift a pebble\nweighing half a pound. Give it a few thousand years,\nand it eats its way through the solid rock, and digs\na course for itself a matter of fifteen or twenty feet\ndeep. And all that process is a mere moment of time,\ncompared with the millions of years that lie behind\nus. If you want to reckon the age of the earth\u2019s\ncrust, they say, you must do it in thousands of\nmillions of years. Queer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cDamned rum.\u201d \u201cYou almost understate the position. Don\u2019t you\nfeel sometimes as if the whole of human life on this\nplanet were a mere episode, and all our boasted\nhuman achievement were a speck on the ocean of\ninfinity?\u201d \u201cSometimes. But one can always take a pill, can\u2019t\none?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, if it comes to that.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. An amusing\ncreature, Pulteney.\u201d \u201cBit highbrow, isn\u2019t he? He always makes me feel\nrather as if I were back at school again. My wife\nlikes him, though.\u201d \u201cHe has the schoolmaster\u2019s manner. It develops\nthe conversational style, talking to a lot of people\nwho have no chance of answering back. You get it\nwith parsons too, sometimes. I really believe it would\nbe almost a disappointment to him if he caught a\nfish, so fond is he of satirizing his own performance.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nYou haven\u2019t been in these parts before, have\nyou?\u201d \u201cNever. It\u2019s a pity, really, to make their\nacquaintance in such a tragic way. Gives you a kind of\ndepressing feeling about a place when your first\nintroduction to it is over a death-bed.\u201d \u201cI am sure it must.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It\u2019s a pity the country\nout toward Pullford has been so much spoilt by\nfactories. It used to be some of the finest country in\nEngland. And there\u2019s nothing like English country,\nis there? Have you travelled much, apart from the\nwar, of course?\u201d \u201cNow, what the devil does this man think he\u2019s\ndoing?\u201d Bredon asked himself. Could it be that\nBrinkman, after making up his mind to unbosom\nhimself, was feeling embarrassed about making a\nstart, was taking refuge in every other conceivable\ntopic so as to put off the dreaded moment of\nconfession? That seemed the only possible construction\nto put on his conversational vagaries. But how to\ngive him a lead? \u201cVery little, as a matter of fact.\nI suppose you went about a good deal with\nMottram? I should think a fellow as rich as he was\ngets a grand chance of seeing the world. Funny his\nwanting to spend his holiday in a poky little place\nlike this.\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose each of us has his favourite\ncorner of earth. There, do you see how deep the\nriver has cut its way into the rock?\u201d They had left the road by a foot-path, which led\ndown steeply through a wood of fir-trees and\nwaist-deep bracken to the river bank. They were now\nlooking up a deep gully, it almost seemed a funnel, of\nrock; both sides falling sheer from the tumbled\nboulders and fern-tufts of the hillside. Before them was a\nnarrow path which had been worn or cut out of the\nrock-face, some five or six feet above the brawling\nstream, just clear of the foam that sprang from its\nsudden waterfalls. There was no habitation in view;\nthe roaring of the water drowned the voice unless\nyou shouted; the sun, so nearly at its zenith, could\nnot reach the foot of the rocks, and the gorge\nitself looked gloomy and a little eerie from the\ncontrast. \u201cLet\u2019s go along the path a bit,\u201d said Brinkman;\n\u201cone gets the effect of it better when one\u2019s right in\nthe middle of it. The path,\u201d he explained, \u201cgoes all\nthe way along, and it\u2019s the regular way by which\npeople go up when they mean to fish the Long Pool.\nI\u2019ll go first, shall I?\u201d For a second Bredon hesitated. The man had so\nobviously been making conversation all the way,\nhad so obviously been anxious to bring him to this\nparticular spot, that he suddenly conceived the idea\nof hostile design. A slight push, disguised as an\neffort to steady you round a corner, might easily\nthrow you off the path into the stream; they were\nalone, and neither rock nor stream, in such an event,\nwould readily give up its secret. Then he felt the\nimpossibility of manufacturing any excuse for\nrefusing the invitation, Brinkman, too, was a good\nfoot smaller than himself. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll\nfollow on.\u201d He added a mental determination to\nfollow at a safe distance. About twenty yards from the entrance, they\nstopped at a resting-place where the rock-path\nwidened out till it was some five feet in breadth.\nBehind it was a smooth face of rock six or seven feet\nin height, a fresh narrow ledge separating it from\nthe next step in that giant\u2019s stairway. \u201cCurious, isn\u2019t\nit,\u201d said Brinkman, \u201cthe way these rocks are piled\nagainst one another? Look at that ledge that runs\nalong, over there to the right, almost like the rack\nin a railway carriage! What accident made that,\nor was it some forgotten human design?\u201d It looked,\nindeed, as if it might have been meant for the\nlarder-shelf of some outlaw who had hidden there in days\ngone by. A piece of white paper\u2014some sandwich\npaper doubtless, that had fallen from above\u2014tried\nto complete the illusion. \u201cYes,\u201d said Bredon, \u201cyou\nexpect to see a notice saying it\u2019s for light articles\nonly. By Jove, this is a place!\u201d Forgetting his\ntremors, he passed by Brinkman, and went\nexploring further along the gorge. Brinkman followed\nslowly, almost reluctantly. There was no more\nconversation till they reached the end of the gorge and\nclimbed up an easy path on to the highroad. Now, surely, if there were going to be any\nconfidential disclosures, they would come. To Bredon\u2019s\nsurprise his companion now seemed to have grown\nmoody and uncommunicative; whatever openings\nwere tried he not only failed to follow them up but\nseemed, by his monosyllabic answers, to be\ndiscouraging all approach. Bredon abandoned the effort at\nlast, and returned to the Load of Mischief\nthoroughly dissatisfied with himself, and more\ncompletely mystified than ever.",
        "Leyland met him immediately on his\nreturn. He had heard from Angela that Bredon\nhad gone out for a walk with Brinkman, and\nat Brinkman\u2019s invitation; something too of the\nabruptness and the eagerness with which the\ninvitation was issued. Clearly, he was anxious to get\nfirst news about Brinkman\u2019s disclosures. There was\nstill half an hour or so to waste before luncheon;\nand Bredon, taking a leaf out of his wife\u2019s book,\nsuggested the ale-house bench as a suitable place for\ntalking things over. \u201cWell?\u201d asked Leyland. \u201cI never dared to hope\nthat Brinkman would react so quickly. What did\nhe say? Or rather, what can you tell me of what he\nsaid?\u201d \u201cNothing. Absolutely nothing. He just took me for\na walk to the gorge and back.\u201d \u201cI say, old thing, are you playing quite fair? I\nmean, if Brinkman only consented to talk to you\nin confidence, by all means say so, and I\u2019ll have to\nbe content.\u201d \u201cBut he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t say a word he mightn\u2019t\nhave said in the parlour to all of us. I can\u2019t make\nhead or tail of it.\u201d \u201cLook here, it\u2019s absurd trying to palm that off\non me. I know you\u2019re more scrupulous than I am\nabout these things; but really, what harm can it do\nto tell me that Brinkman has confided to you? It\ndoesn\u2019t make it any easier or any harder for me to\nput you into the witness-box; and short of that I\ncan\u2019t get it out of you if you don\u2019t want to tell me.\nI won\u2019t badger you; I won\u2019t try and worm it out of\nyou; honestly I won\u2019t. But don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re\nstill as ignorant of Brinkman\u2019s movements this last\nweek as I am.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil am I to say? Can\u2019t you believe\na fellow when he tells the truth? I tell you that all\nthe way to the gorge he talked about anything that\ncame into his head; and coming back from the gorge\nhe wouldn\u2019t talk about anything at all\u2014I simply\ncouldn\u2019t get him to talk.\u201d \u201cAnd at the gorge?\u201d \u201cHe talked about the gorge. A regular morning\nwith Herr Baedeker. There really isn\u2019t anything\nmore to it.\u201d \u201cLook here, let\u2019s get this straight. We put up a\nconversation together in a place where we know for\na fact that Brinkman\u2019s listening behind the wall\u2014and\nit isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s listened to us, either.\nI explain in a loud voice that I\u2019ve taken out a\nwarrant, or rather that I\u2019m just going to take out a\nwarrant, for his arrest, and that his best chance\nof saving himself from arrest is to confide in you\nor me. An hour or so afterward he comes up to you,\nwhile you\u2019re sitting out there with Mrs. Bredon\nin the middle of a conversation. He takes no\nnotice at all of Mrs. Bredon, but asks you to come\nout for a morning walk\u2014on the transparent excuse\nthat he wants to shew you this beastly ditch of\nhis. And then he proceeds to waste more than an hour\nof his time and yours by talking platitudes about\nthe scenery. Are we really going to sit down and\nadmit that?\u201d \u201cConfound it all; we\u2019ve got to. I\u2019m no better\npleased about it than you are. But, God knows,\nI gave him every chance of having a talk if he\nwanted to.\u201d \u201cDo you think he was trying to pump you,\nperhaps? Can\u2019t you remember at all what he did talk\nabout?\u201d \u201cTalked about Pulteney a little. Said he was a\ntypical schoolmaster, or something of that sort.\nOh, yes, and he talked about geology\u2014probable\nage of the earth, if I remember right. Asked me\nwhether I\u2019d been here before. Asked me whether I\u2019d\nbeen abroad much. I really can\u2019t recall his saying\nanything else.\u201d \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you said nothing which could\nfrighten him, which could put him off?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t have been more careful to avoid it.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2014can you make anything of it\nyourself?\u201d \u201cThe only idea that occurred to me is that\npossibly Brinkman wanted me to be away from the\nhouse for some reason; and chose this way of\nmaking sure that I was.\u201d \u201cM\u2019m!\u2014it\u2019s possible, of course? But why should\nhe want you to be away\u2014especially if he\u2019s going\nto be away too?\u201d \u201cI know, it doesn\u2019t really make sense. I say,\nLeyland, I\u2019m awfully sorry about this.\u201d He felt absurdly\napologetic, though without seeing any way of putting\nthe blame on himself. \u201cLook here, I\u2019ll tell you one\nthing: it\u2019s not in our bargain, of course, but I don\u2019t\nthink there\u2019s any harm in telling you. Simmonds\ndidn\u2019t know about the Euthanasia policy. Or rather,\nhe did expect it to come to him at one time, but not\nthis last week or two, because he\u2019d heard about the\ncodicil leaving it to the Bishop\u2014heard, at any rate,\nthat it wasn\u2019t coming to him. So I\u2019m afraid your\ntheory about Simmonds wants revising.\u201d \u201cIt has already been revised. This is very\ninteresting: you say it\u2019s certain Simmonds knew about\nthe change of plan?\u201d \u201cYes. You can guess the source.\u201d \u201cAnd do you suppose he had any idea where the\nnew will was kept? Whether it was up in London,\nI mean, or in Mottram\u2019s own possession?\u201d \u201cThat I couldn\u2019t say. Does it make much\ndifference?\u201d \u201cA lot of difference. Look here, you\u2019ve been\ndealing openly with me, so I\u2019ll give you some\ninformation in return. But I warn you you won\u2019t like it,\nbecause it doesn\u2019t help your theory of a suicide a\nbit. Look here.\u201d He glanced round to see that\nnobody was watching them, then took an envelope\nfrom his pocket, and cautiously shook out into his\nopen palm a triangle of paper. It was blue, lined\npaper, with an official sort of look about it. It was\nobviously a corner left over from a document which\nhad been burned, for the hypotenuse opposite the\nright angle was a frayed edge of brown ash. The\nwriting on it was \u201cclerkly\u201d\u2014there is no other word\nto describe its combination of ugliness with legibility.\nOnly a fragment of writing was left on each of the\nthree lines which the paper contained, for there\nwas a generous allowance of margin. It was a bottom\nright-hand corner that the fire had spared; and the\nsurviving ends of the lines read: \n\u201cqueath \naken out by \nMarch in the year\u201d\n \u201cWell, how\u2019s that?\u201d said Leyland. \u201cI don\u2019t think\nwe shall differ much over the reading of it.\u201d \u201cNo. It\u2019s really rather disappointing, when you\nare supposed to be a detective, for a document to\ncome to hand in such excellent condition\u2014what\nthere is of it. There aren\u2019t two words in the\nEnglish language that end with the syllable \u2018queath,\u2019\nand unless I am mistaken\u2014no, as you were\u2014the\nword in the next line might be either \u2018taken\u2019 or\n\u2018mistaken.\u2019 And of course there\u2019s Interlaken, when one\ncomes to think of it, and weaken, and shaken, and\noaken, and all sorts of words. But, as you say, or\nrather imply, \u2018taken out by\u2019 makes the best sense.\nAnd I shall hardly be communicating new\nimpressions to you if I suggest that one speaks of \u2018taking\nout\u2019 insurance policies. Do you happen to know when\nMottram took out his Euthanasia? I believe I\u2019ve\ngot the record upstairs.\u201d \u201cHe took it out in March. There isn\u2019t a bit of\ndoubt about this document as it stands. It\u2019s the\ncopy of a will, made out by Mottram, having\nreference to the Euthanasia policy. Now, unless this was\na new will altogether\u2014which is possible\u2014that\nmeans that this was a copy of his second will, or\nrather of the codicil which referred to the policy.\nFor in the will, if you remember, there was no\nallusion to the Euthanasia at all.\u201d \u201cI suppose that it is absolutely certain that this\nscrap of paper belonged to Mottram?\u201d \u201cQuite certain\u2014that\u2019s the extraordinary thing, the\nway I found it. The undertaker came round this\nmorning to make\u2014well, certain arrangements. As\nyou know, I had taken command of the key of\nMottram\u2019s room; it\u2019s been locked by my orders ever\nsince you and I had that look round\u2014except\nyesterday, when I took the Coroner in. The undertaker\ncame to me for the key this morning, and I went into\nthe room with him; and, just mooning about there\naimlessly, I saw something that you and I had failed\nto see when we were searching the room\u2014this bit\nof paper. We were not much to blame, for it was\nrather hidden away, behind the writing-table; that\nis, between the writing-table and the window. To\ndo us justice, I don\u2019t know how we came to overlook\nit. Considering it was in Mottram\u2019s room, I don\u2019t\nthink it is a very wild speculation to suppose that it\nwas a part of Mottram\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cNo, that seems reasonable. And how does it fit\ninto your view of the case? I mean\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s conceivable that Mottram\nburned the thing himself. But it doesn\u2019t really make\nvery much sense when you come to think of it. We\nknow, and Mottram knew, that it was only a spare\ncopy of the will which the solicitors had got up in\nLondon. It wasn\u2019t a very important document,\ntherefore, one way or the other. And I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t\nescaped your observation that whereas burning\npapers is a natural way to get rid of them in winter,\nwhen there\u2019s a fire in the grate, one doesn\u2019t do it\nin summer unless one\u2019s absolutely put to it.\nNothing burns more ill-temperedly than a piece of paper\nwhen you have to set light to it with a match. You\ncan\u2019t even burn it whole, without great difficulty,\nfor you must either keep hold of it, and so leave\na corner unburnt, or else leave it lying about in a\ngrate or somewhere, and then the flame generally\ndies down before it is finished. In this case, it is\npretty clear that somebody must have held it in\nhis hand, or it probably wouldn\u2019t be a corner that\nremained unburnt. I can find no finger-marks.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t a man who was destroying an\nimportant document be apt to take care he didn\u2019t leave\nany of it lying about?\u201d \u201cCertainly, if he\u2019d plenty of time to do it in.\nIf it had been Mottram, for example, burning his\nown will. It seems to me more like the action of a\nman in a hurry; and I suspect that the man who\nburned this document was in a hurry. Or at least\nhe was flustered; for he had been committing a\nmurder, and so few people can keep their heads\naltogether in that position.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Simmonds, then, by your way of it?\u201d \u201cWho else? You see, at first I was in rather a\ndifficulty. We had assumed, what it was natural to\nassume, that this codicil which Mottram added to\nhis will was kept a secret\u2014that Simmonds didn\u2019t\nknow about it, and that he\u2019d murdered Mottram\nunder the mistaken idea that he would inherit the\nEuthanasia benefits as the next of kin. Now, if\nthat had been his intention, it would have been\nrather a coincidence his happening to light on the\nwill and be able to burn it. But you tell me that\nSimmonds did know about the codicil; very well,\nthat solves the difficulty. It was a double crime\nnot only in fact but in intention. You thought that\nSimmonds\u2019s knowledge of the codicil gave him a\nsort of moral alibi. On the contrary, it only fastens\nthe halter round his neck. He determined to destroy\nMottram and the will together, and so inherit. The\nmotive is more obvious than ever. The only thing\nwhich he unfortunately hadn\u2019t taken into account\nwas the fact that the copy of the codicil which he\ndestroyed was a duplicate, and the original was up\nin London.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t it rather a big supposition, that\nSimmonds not only knew the codicil was in existence\nbut knew that it was in Mottram\u2019s possession when\nhe came down here, and that it would be lying about\nin Mottram\u2019s room, quite easy for him to find?\u201d \u201cYou forget Mottram\u2019s psychology. When\nSimmonds offended him, he wasn\u2019t content that\nSimmonds should be cut out of his will; he wanted\nhim to know that he\u2019d been cut out of the will\u2014directed\nthe lawyers to inform him of the fact. When\nhe added that codicil about the Euthanasia,\nalthough he made such a secret of it all round, he\nwas careful, as we know, to inform Simmonds that\nit had been done. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s likely that\nhe wrote to Simmonds and said, \u2018I have willed the\nEuthanasia policy away to strangers, so as to\nprevent it coming to you; you can look in on me\nwhen I\u2019m at Chilthorpe, and I\u2019ll shew you the\ndocument\u2019? And Simmonds, not understanding the\npernicketiness of lawyers, imagined that it would be\nthe original of the will, not a copy, that Mottram\nhad by him. So, when he came round here on his\nmidnight visit, or rather on his early morning visit,\nhe turned off the gas, flung the window open,\nransacked the despatch-box which he found lying on\nthe table, found the will, and burnt it hastily at the\nopen window. Probably he thought the unburnt\nfragment had fallen out of the window; actually it had\nfallen under the table, and here we are!\u201d \u201cIt was Angela, I suppose, who told you that\nSimmonds knew he had been cut out of the will?\u201d \u201cWith the best intentions. Mrs. Bredon thought,\nof course, that my suspicion of Simmonds could\nnot survive the revelation. As a matter of fact, it\nall fitted in nicely. Well, it just shews that one\nshould never waste time trying to puzzle out a\nproblem until one\u2019s sure that all the relevant facts\nhave been collated. Here were you and I worrying\nour lives out over the difficulty, and all because we\nhad never noticed that bit of paper lying on the\nfloor\u2014and might never have noticed it, if I hadn\u2019t\nhappened to go in with the undertaker. Now, there\u2019s\nonly Brinkman\u2019s part of the business to settle. Apart\nfrom that, it\u2019s as clear as daylight.\u201d \u201cYou think so? Well, you must think me a\nfrightful Sadducee, but even now I don\u2019t mind doubling\nthat bet again.\u201d \u201cForty pounds! Good Lord, man, the\nIndescribable must pay you well! Or do they insure you\nagainst losing bets? Well, it would eat a big hole\nin my salary. But if you want to throw your money\naway, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d \u201cGood! Forty quid. We\u2019d best keep it dark from\nAngela, though. I say, when \u2018Raight-ho\u2019 makes that\nhorrible noise on the tom-tom inside, it generally\nmeans that Mrs. Davis has finished blowing the\ndust off the cold ham. What\u2019s wrong with going in\nand seeing about a little lunch?\u201d",
        "When they came into the coffee room,\nBredon had the instantaneous impression\nwe all get occasionally that the room was\ntoo full. Then, on disentangling his sensations, he\nwas delighted to find that the newcomer was Mr.\nEames, who was exchanging a word or two with\nBrinkman, though he seemed not to have been\nintroduced to the others. \u201cGood man!\u201d said Bredon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you met my wife, did you? This is\nMr. Pulteney\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. it was very good of you to keep\nyour promise.\u201d \u201cAs it turned out, I should have had to come in\nany case. The Bishop had to go off to a confirmation,\nso, when he heard the funeral was down here, he\nsent me to represent him. You see, we heard from\nthe solicitors about our windfall\u2014I suspect you\nwere keeping that dark, Mr. Bredon\u2014and he was\nvery much touched by Mr. Mottram\u2019s kindness.\nHe wished he could have come, Mr. Brinkman, but\nof course a confirmation is a difficult engagement to\nget out of.\u201d \u201cI really knew nothing about the will when I came\nover to Pullford,\u201d protested Bredon. \u201cI\u2019ve heard\nabout it since, of course. Can I offer my\ncongratulations to the diocese, or would it look too much like\ngifts from the Greeks?\u201d \u201cNonsense; you serve your company, Mr.\nBredon, and none of us bears you any ill-will for it.\nI hope, by the way, I have not been indiscreet in\nmentioning the subject?\u201d he glanced for a moment\nat the old gentleman. \u201cThe Bishop, of course, has\nnot mentioned the matter except to me, because he\nquite realizes there may be legal difficulties.\u201d \u201cI can keep a secret as well as most men,\u201d\nexplained Pulteney. \u201cThat is to say, I have the\ncommon human vanity which makes every man like\nto be in possession of a secret; and perhaps less\nthan my share of the vulgar itch for imparting\ninformation. But you know Chilthorpe little, sir, if\nyou speak of discretion in the same four walls with\nMrs. Davis. I assure you that the testamentary\ndispositions of the late Mr. Mottram are seldom off\nher lips.\u201d There was a fractional pause, while everybody tried\nto think how Mrs. Davis knew. Then they\nremembered that the matter had been mentioned, though\nonly incidentally, at the inquest. \u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Eames. \u201cI have met Mrs.\nDavis before. If it is true that confession lightens\nour burdens, the Load of Mischief must sit easily\non her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so glad they haven\u2019t changed the name of\nthe inn,\u201d observed Angela. \u201cThese old-fashioned\nnames are getting so rare. And the Load of Mischief\nis hardly an encouraging title.\u201d \u201cThere used,\u201d said Eames, \u201cto be an inn in my\nold\u2014in the parish where I lived\u2014which was called\n\u2018The Labour in Vain.\u2019 I sometimes thought of it as\nan omen.\u201d \u201cAre you of the funeral party, Mr. Pulteney?\u201d\nasked Leyland, seeing the old gentleman dressed in\ndeep black. \u201cThere is no hiding anything from you\ndetectives. Yes, I have promised myself the rustic treat\nof a funeral. In the scholastic profession such thrills\nare rare; they make us retire at sixty nowadays.\nMy lot is cast amidst the young; I see ever fresh\ngenerations succeeding to the old, filling up the gaps\nin the ranks of humanity; and I confess that when\none sees the specimens one sometimes doubts whether\nthe process is worth while. But do not let me cast\na gloom over our convivialities. Let us eat and drink,\nMrs. Davis\u2019s \u2018shape\u2019 seems to say to us, for\nto-morrow we die.\u201d \u201cI hope I oughtn\u2019t to have gone,\u201d said Angela.\n\u201cI\u2019d have brought my blacks if I\u2019d thought of it.\u201d \u201cWithout them, you would be a glaring offence\nagainst village etiquette. No, Mrs. Bredon, your\npresence would not be expected. The company needs\nno representatives at the funeral; more practical,\nit sheds golden tears over the coffin. For the rest of\nus it is different. Mr. Eames pays a last tribute to\nhis diocesan benefactor. Mr. Brinkman, like a good\nsecretary, must despatch the material envelope to\nits permanent address. For myself, what am I? A\nfellow wayfarer in an inn; and yet what more is\nany of us in this brief world? No, Mrs. Bredon,\nyou are exempt.\u201d \u201cOh, do stop him,\u201d said Angela. \u201cHow did you\ncome down, Mr. Eames?\u201d \u201cBy the midday train, a funeral pageant in\nitself. Was Mr. Mottram much known in the\nneighbourhood?\u201d \u201cHe is now,\u201d replied Mr. Pulteney, with\nirrepressible ghoulishness. \u201cThe victim of sudden death\nis like a diver; no instinct of decency withholds us\nfrom watching his taking-off.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he had any near relations living,\u201d\nsaid Brinkman, \u201cexcept young Simmonds. He\u2019ll be\nthere, I suppose; but there wasn\u2019t much love lost\nbetween them. He will hardly be interested, anyhow,\nin the reading of the will.\u201d \u201cBy the way, Mr. Brinkman, His Lordship asked\nme to say that you will be very welcome at the\nCathedral house, if you are detained in Pullford at\nall.\u201d \u201cIt is extremely kind of him. But I had wound up\nall Mr. Mottram\u2019s outstanding affairs before he\ncame away for his holiday, and I don\u2019t suppose I\nshall be needed. I was thinking of going up to\nLondon in a day or two. I have to shift for myself,\nyou see.\u201d \u201cHave some coffee, Eames,\u201d suggested Bredon;\n\u201cyou must need it after a tiring journey like that.\u201d \u201cThanks, I think I will. Not that I\u2019m tired, really.\nIt makes so much difference on the railway if you\nare occupied.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say you are one of those\nfortunate creatures who can work in railway trains?\u201d \u201cNo, not work. I played patience all the way.\u201d \u201cPatience? Did I hear you say patience? Ah, but\nyou only brought one pack, of course.\u201d \u201cNo, I always travel with two.\u201d \u201cTwo? And Mr. Pulteney has two! Angela, that\nsettles it! This afternoon I shall have a game.\u201d \u201cMiles, dear, not the game? You know you can\u2019t\nplay that and think of anything else at the same\ntime. Mr. Eames, would you mind dropping your\npacks in the river? You see, it\u2019s so bad for my\nhusband; he sits down to an interminable game of\npatience, and forgets all about his work and\neverything.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Angela; it clears the\nbrain. When you\u2019ve been puzzled over a thing, as I\nhave been over this question of suicide, your brains\nget all stale and used up, and you must give them\na fresh start. A game of patience will just do the\ntrick. No, no milk, thanks. Would you tell Mrs.\nDavis\u201d\u2014this was to the barmaid\u2014\u201cthat I shall be\nvery busy all the latter part of this afternoon, and\nmustn\u2019t be disturbed on any account? It\u2019s all right,\nAngela; I\u2019ll give you half an hour now to\nremonstrate with me, but it won\u2019t be any use.\u201d It was not, as a matter of fact, till after the\nfuneral party had left, and the coffin been removed,\nthat Miles and Angela foregathered. They went to\nthe old mill-house, feeling that it would be a safe\nplace for confidences now that Brinkman was\notherwise engaged. \u201cWell,\u201d said Angela, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re\nwanting some Watson work?\u201d \u201cBadly. Look here, one of us, either Leyland or I,\nis beginning to feel the strain a bit. Everything that\ncrops up makes him more and more determined to\nhave Simmonds\u2019s blood, and me more and more\ninclined to stick to my old solution.\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t been doubling that bet again, have\nyou?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a detail. Look here, I must tell you all\nabout his find this morning.\u201d And he proceeded to\nexplain the whole business of the piece of paper, and\nLeyland\u2019s inferences from it. \u201cNow,\u201d he finished up,\n\u201cwhat d\u2019you make of all that?\u201d \u201cWell, he has got a case, hasn\u2019t he? I mean, his\nexplanation would explain things.\u201d \u201cYes, but look at the difficulties.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s have them. No, wait a minute, I believe I\ncan do the difficulties. Let\u2019s try a little womanly\nintuish. First, you\u2019d have noticed the piece of paper\nif it had been there when you went in.\u201d \u201cNot necessarily. It\u2019s wonderful what one can\noverlook if one isn\u2019t thinking about it.\u201d \u201cWell, then, Simmonds wouldn\u2019t have been such\na chump as to burn the thing on the spot. Especially\nwith a foul smell of gas in the room, not to mention\nthe corpse. He\u2019d have shoved it into his pocket and\ntaken it home.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal in that. But Leyland would\nsay that Simmonds was afraid to do that for fear he\nshould be stopped and searched.\u201d \u201cPretty thin. And, then, of course, if it was really\nimportant for him to get the document out of the\nway, he wouldn\u2019t have left a bit lying about. He\u2019d\nhave seen that it was all burnt.\u201d \u201cLeyland says that was because he was in a\nhurry.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s have some others. I\u2019m used up.\u201d \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see that a man who is burning an\nimportant document, holding it in his hand all the\ntime, takes it up by the least important corner,\nprobably a blank space at the top? This is the work of\na man who wasn\u2019t particularly keen on destroying\nall traces of the document, and he held it by the\nbottom right-hand corner, as one naturally would.\u201d \u201cWhy not the left hand, and the match in one\u2019s\nright? Ha! The left-handed criminal. We are in\nluck.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you believe it. You start holding it at the\nleft-hand corner, and then transfer it to your right\nhand when you\u2019ve thrown the match away. You try,\nnext time you\u2019re burning your dressmaker\u2019s bill. And\nhere\u2019s another point: Simmonds would have been\nbound to stand with his head right in the window, to\nkeep clear of the gas fumes. Almost certainly he\nwould have put the paper down on the window-sill\nand let it burn, leaving one of those curious damp\nmarks. He didn\u2019t, because I should have been bound\nto notice that; I was looking for marks on the\nwindow-sill. If he held it in his hand, he would be\nholding it outside the window, and he wouldn\u2019t be\nsuch a chump as to throw away the odd corner in the\nroom when he could pitch it out of the window.\nAnother thing: he wouldn\u2019t have dared to burn a light\nat the window like that for fear of attracting\nattention.\u201d \u201cWell, I still think my objections were more\nimportant. But go on.\u201d \u201cWell, since that piece of paper wasn\u2019t dropped\nin the room before Leyland and I went into\nit\u2014probably not, anyhow\u2014it looks as if it had been dropped\nin the room since Leyland and I went into it. Or, at\nany rate, since the first police search. Because the\nroom has been kept locked, one way and another,\nsince then.\u201d \u201cThere was no deceiving this man.\u201d \u201cWhich makes it very improbable that the piece of\npaper was dropped there by accident at all. Anybody\nwho went in there had no business to go in there,\nand would be jolly careful not to leave any traces.\nWe are therefore irresistibly compelled, my dear\nAngela, to the conclusion that somebody dropped\nit there on purpose.\u201d \u201cThat firm grasp of the obvious. Yes?\u201d \u201cHe put it there deliberately to create an\nimpression. Now, it might be to create the impression that\nSimmonds was the murderer. To whose advantage\nwould that be?\u201d \u201cMr. Leyland\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAngela, don\u2019t be flippant. Is there anybody?\u201d \u201cWell, Mr. Simmonds hasn\u2019t any enemies that we\nknow of. Unless it was somebody who was\ndisappointed in the quality of his handkerchiefs. What\nyou want me to say is, that it must be somebody\nwho has murdered Mottram himself, and wants to\nsave his skin by pretending it was Simmonds that\ndid it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m dashed if I want you to say that. In fact, it\u2019s\njust what I didn\u2019t want you to say. Of course if you\nassume that Mottram was murdered by Brinkman,\nit does all work out, most unpleasantly well. You\nsee, when Leyland and I were sitting here, talking\nat Brinkman, who was hiding behind the wall,\nLeyland did say that the only thing which prevented him\nfrom arresting Simmonds was the fact that he\u2019d no\nevidence to connect him with the actual room. I\ncould see what he was up to\u2014he wanted Brinkman\nto take the hint (assuming, of course, that he was\nthe real murderer) and start manufacturing clues\nto incriminate Simmonds. Well, it looks very much\nas if Brinkman had taken the hint, and were doing\nidentically what Leyland suggested. Curse it all.\u201d \u201cStill, it was clever of Brinky to get in when the\ndoor was locked.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing. I wouldn\u2019t put it beyond\nBrinkman to have a duplicate key of that door.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nNo, I\u2019ve nothing to fall back on really except the\nabsence of motive. What earthly reason had\nBrinkman for wanting to do Mottram in? Or rather, I\nhave one other thing to fall back on. But it\u2019s not\nevidence; it\u2019s instinct.\u201d \u201cAs how?\u201d \u201cWhy, don\u2019t you see that the whole thing works\nout too beastly well? Isn\u2019t it rather too obviously a\nruse? I mean, that idea of dropping a piece of paper\nwith only half a dozen words on it, and yet those\nhalf-dozen words shewing exactly what the\ndocument was? Isn\u2019t it rather too obviously a plant?\u201d \u201cBut it was a plant, if Brinky put it there.\u201d \u201cYes, but isn\u2019t it too obviously a plant? So\nobviously, I mean, that you couldn\u2019t expect anybody,\neven Leyland, to think for a moment that it was\ngenuine? Can Brinkman really have thought that\nLeyland wouldn\u2019t see through it?\u201d \u201cBut if he didn\u2019t think so\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cDouble bluff, my good woman, double bluff. I\ncan tell you, crime is becoming quite a specialized\nprofession nowadays. Don\u2019t you see that Brinkman\nargued to himself like this: \u2018If I leave an obviously\nfaked clue lying about like this, Leyland will\nimmediately think that it is a faked clue, used by one\ncriminal to shove off the blame on another. Who the\ncriminals are, or which is which, doesn\u2019t matter. It\nwill convince him that there has, after all, been a\nmurder. And it will disguise from him the fact that\nit was suicide.\u2019 Of course all that\u2019s making\nBrinkman out to be a pretty smart lad. But I fancy he is\na pretty smart lad. And I read that piece of paper\nas a bit of double bluff, meant to harden the\ningenious Leyland in his belief that the suicide was a\nmurder.\u201d \u201cYe-es. It\u2019ll look pretty thin before a jury, won\u2019t\nit?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t I know that it\u2019ll look thin before a jury?\nEspecially as, on my shewing, Brinkman was\nprepared to let suspicion of murder rest on himself\nrather than admit it was suicide. But it does give\nus a motive. There\u2019s no doubt that Brinkman is a\nfanatical anti-clerical, and would do anything to\nprevent Mottram\u2019s money going to a Catholic\ndiocese.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I say, what\u2019s that?\u201d A sudden sneeze, an unmistakable sneeze, had\ncome from somewhere immediately behind them. In\na twinkling Bredon had rushed round to the other\nside of the wall. But there was nobody there.",
        "Bredon and his wife looked at one another\nin astonishment. It was impossible that the\nfuneral should yet be over; impossible,\nsurely, that Brinkman, whose place in the pageant\nwas such a prominent one, should have absented\nhimself from the ceremony unnoticed. There was no\ndoubt as to the path which the self-betrayed listener\nmust have taken. From behind the wall, there was a\ngap in a privet-hedge, and through this there was a\ndirect and speedy retreat to the back door of the\ninn. The inn itself, when they went back to it, was\nas silent as the grave\u2014indeed, the comparison\nforced itself upon their minds. It was as if the coffin\nfrom upstairs had taken all human life away with\nit when it went on its last journey, leaving nothing\nbut the ticking of clocks and the steaming of a kettle\nin the kitchen to rob solitude of its silence. Outside\nthe sun still shone brightly, though there was a\nmenacing bank of cloud coming up from the south.\nThe air felt breathless and oppressive; not a door\ncould bang, not a window rattle. The very flies on\nthe window-panes seemed drowsy. The Bredons\npassed from room to room, in the vain hope of\ndiscovering an intruder; everywhere the same\nloneliness, the same stillness met them. Bredon had an\nodd feeling as if they ought, after all, to be at the\nfuneral; it was so like the emptiness of his old\nschool when everybody was out of doors except\nhimself on a summer day. \u201cI can\u2019t stand much of this,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go\ndown toward the churchyard, and see if we can\nmeet them coming back. Then at least we shall be\nin a position to know who wasn\u2019t here.\u201d The expedition, however, proved abortive; they\nmet Eames almost on the doorstep, and down the\nstreet figures melting away by twos and threes from\nthe churchyard shewed that the funeral was at an\nend. \u201cI say, come in here,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cI want to\ntalk things over a bit, Mr. Eames.\u201d And the three\nretired into that \u201cbest room\u201d where tea had been\nlaid on the afternoon of the Bredons\u2019 arrival.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just come back from the funeral?\u201d \u201cThis moment. Why?\u201d \u201cCan you tell us for certain who was there? Was\nBrinkman there, for example?\u201d \u201cCertainly. He was standing just next me.\u201d \u201cAnd Mr. Simmonds from the shop\u2014do you\nknow him by sight?\u201d \u201cHe was pointed out to me as the chief mourner.\nI had a word with him afterward. But why all this\nexcitement about the local celebrities?\u201d \u201cTell him, Miles,\u201d said Angela. \u201cHe may be able\nto throw some light on all this.\u201d And Bredon told\nEames of the strange eavesdropping that went on\nbehind the mill-house wall; something, too, of the\nsuspicions which he and Leyland entertained, and\nthe difficulty they both found in giving any\nexplanation of the whole tragedy. \u201cWell, it\u2019s very extraordinary. Pulteney, of course\ndidn\u2019t go after all\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cPulteney didn\u2019t go?\u201d \u201cNo; didn\u2019t you hear him say, soon after\nluncheon, that his good resolutions had broken down, and\nthat he wasn\u2019t going to the funeral after all? I\nthought it rather extraordinary at the time.\u201d \u201cYou mean his sudden change of plan?\u201d \u201cNo, the reason he gave for it. He said the\nafternoon was too tempting, and he really must go out\nfishing.\u201d \u201cIs that a very odd reason for Pulteney? He\u2019s an\nincalculable sort of creature.\u201d \u201cYes, but it doesn\u2019t happen to be true. Can\u2019t you\nfeel the thunder in the air? If you can\u2019t, the fishes\ncan, And when there\u2019s thunder in the air they won\u2019t\nrise. Pulteney knows that as well as I do.\u201d \u201cWould you know his rod if you saw it?\u201d \u201cYes, I was looking at it with him just before\nluncheon.\u201d \u201cCome on.\u201d They went out into the front hall, and\nEames gave a quick glance round. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\nin the corner. He\u2019s no more out fishing than you\nor I.\u201d \u201cEdward!\u201d said Angela as they returned to the\nbest room. \u201cTo think it was my Edward all the\ntime.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t rag, Angela; this is serious. Now, can\u2019t\nit have been Pulteney listening all along?\u201d \u201cHe was there, you know, when you and Leyland\narranged to go out to the mill-house after breakfast.\nAnd he was there at luncheon, though I don\u2019t think\neither of us mentioned that we meant to go there.\nStill, he might have guessed that. But what on earth\nis the poor old dear up to?\u201d \u201cWell, one or two things are clear. About\nBrinkman, I mean. Whatever his idea may have been\nwhen he took me out for a walk to the gorge and\ntalked about geology he wasn\u2019t \u2018reacting\u2019 on\nLeyland\u2019s suggestion, because it wasn\u2019t he who was\nlistening behind the wall when the suggestion was\nmade. And there\u2019s another thing\u2014this bit of paper\nLeyland found lying about in the room upstairs. If\nBrinkman put it there, then Brinkman did it on his\nown; he wasn\u2019t playing up to the suggestion which\nLeyland made about wanting clues to incriminate\nSimmonds with.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d objected Angela, \u201cwe never proved that it\nwas Brinky who left that old clue lying about. We\nonly assumed it, because we thought it was Brinky\nwho was listening behind the wall.\u201d \u201cYou mean that if Pulteney was listening, and\nPulteney was\u2014well, was somehow interested in\nconfusing the tracks of the murder, it may have been\nhe who left the bit of paper under the table.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say so. But it seems quite as much on\nthe cards as anything else in this frightful business.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see, now, what do we know about Pulteney?\nWe know, in the first place, that he was sleeping in\nthe house on the night when Mottram died. Actually,\nhe had the room next door to Mottram\u2019s\u2014between\nhis and the one we\u2019ve got now. According to his own\nevidence, he slept soundly all night, and heard\nnothing. On the other hand, his own evidence shewed\nthat he went to bed after Mottram and Brinkman,\nand we\u2019ve nothing, therefore, to confirm his own\naccount of his movements. He was woken up the next\nmorning after the tragedy had occurred, and when\nhe was told about it all he said was\u2014what was it,\nAngela?\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018In that case, Mrs. Davis, I shall fish the Long\nPool this morning.\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201cThat might almost be represented as suggesting\nthat he wasn\u2019t exactly surprised when he heard of\nMottram\u2019s death, mightn\u2019t it? All his references to\nMottram\u2019s death since then have been rather\u2014shall\nwe say?\u2014lacking in feeling. He, no less than\nBrinkman, seemed to be anxious that we should interpret\nthe death as suicide, because it was he who suggested\nto me that idea about Mottram having brought down\nthe wrong flies, as if he never really had any\nintention of fishing at all. He has been rather inquisitive\nabout when Brinkman was leaving, and when we\nwere leaving too, for that matter. That\u2019s all you can\nscrape together, I think, against his general\nbehaviour. And against that, of course, you\u2019ve got to\nput the absence of all known motive.\u201d \u201cAnd the general character of the man,\u201d\nsuggested Eames. \u201cI suppose so.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. What impression exactly does\nhe make on you?\u201d \u201cWhy, that he is out of touch with real life. All\nthat macabre humour of his about corpses and so on\nis an academic thing\u2014he has never really felt death\nclose to. I don\u2019t say that a superb actor mightn\u2019t\nadopt that ironical pose. I only say it\u2019s far more\nnatural to regard him as a harmless old gentleman\nwho reflects and doesn\u2019t act. It\u2019s very seldom that\nyou find the capacity for acute reflection and the\ncapacity for successful action combined in the same\ncharacter. At least, that\u2019s always been my\nimpression.\u201d \u201cWell, granted that we acquit him of the main\ncharge, as Leyland would acquit Brinkman of the\nmain charge. He still comes under the minor\nsuspicion of eavesdropping. He\u2019s as good a candidate\nfor that position as Brinkman himself, only that it\nwas Brinkman\u2019s brand of cigarette we found behind\nthe wall yesterday.\u201d \u201cEdward had run out, you remember,\u201d suggested\nAngela. \u201cHe might have borrowed one from Brinky,\nor pinched it when he wasn\u2019t looking. And to be\naccurate, we must remember that the first time we\nwere overheard, when we were talking in my room,\nthe listener had disappeared before you got into the\npassage, and the next room to ours is Edward\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAnd besides, we know now that it wasn\u2019t\nBrinkman, this time at any rate. Because he was away\nat the funeral. Whereas Pulteney shirked the funeral\non an obviously false ground; didn\u2019t go to the\nfuneral and didn\u2019t go fishing either. Assuming that the\nlistener is the same all through, it looks bad for\nPulteney.\u201d A knock at the door suddenly interrupted their\ninterview. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d said a gentle voice, and\nfollowing it, flushed as with hot walking yet still\nbeaming with its habitual benevolence, came the\nface of Mr. Pulteney. \u201cAh, Mr. Bredon, they told me I would find you\nin here. I wanted a word with you. Could we go\noutside, or\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cNonsense, Mr. Pulteney,\u201d said Angela firmly.\n\u201cWhat Mr. Eames and I don\u2019t know isn\u2019t worth\nknowing. Come in and tell us all about it.\u201d \u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got to make a\nkind of confession. It\u2019s a very humiliating\nconfession for me to make, because I\u2019m afraid, once again,\nI\u2019ve been guilty of curiosity. I simply cannot mind\nmy own business.\u201d \u201cAnd what have you been up to now?\u201d asked\nAngela. \u201cWhy, when I said I was going out fishing this\nafternoon, I\u2019m afraid I was guilty of a prevarication.\nIndeed, when I announced my intention of going to\nthe funeral, I was beginning to weave the tangled\nweb of those who first practise to deceive. You see,\nI didn\u2019t want Brinkman to know.\u201d \u201cTo know what?\u201d \u201cWell, that I was rather suspicious about his\nmovements. You see, I\u2019ve asked him several times\nwhen he means to leave Chilthorpe, and he always\ntalks as if he was quite uncertain of his plans. He\ndid so at breakfast, you remember. But this\nmorning, when I went up to get a sponge I had left in\nthe bathroom, I saw Brinkman packing.\u201d \u201cPacking?\u201d \u201cWell, he was wandering about the room clearing\nup his papers, and there was a despatch-box open\non the table, and a suitcase on the floor. And, as I\nknew he was due to be at the funeral, I thought\nthis was rather a funny time for him to want to\nleave. Especially as he\u2019d given no notice to Mrs.\nDavis. So I wondered whether, perhaps, there was\nanything behind it.\u201d \u201cYou did well to wonder,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cSo what\ndid you do?\u201d \u201cWell it stuck in my head that Mottram, when he\ncame down here, came in a motor-car. Mrs. Davis,\nthough her trade announcement advertises good\naccommodation for man and beast, does not run to a\ngarage. There is only one in Chilthorpe; you can\njust see it down the road there. Now, thought I, if\nby any chance Mr. Brinkman is meditating a\nprecipitate disappearance, it would be like his caution\nto have made all arrangements beforehand. And if\nI went down to the garage and had a look at the\ncar, it might be that I, though heaven knows I am\nno motorist, should be able to see whether he had\ngot the car in proper trim for a journey.\u201d \u201cYou must have talked very nicely to the garage\npeople,\u201d suggested Angela. \u201cIt would never do if\nyou were suspected of being a motor-thief.\u201d \u201cWell, I had to do my best. I changed my mind\nabout going to the funeral, and made the excuse\nthat I wanted to go fishing. I heard you gasp, Mr.\nEames; but Brinkman knows nothing about\nfishing. Then, when you had started, I went off to the\ngarage by myself. Fortunately, very fortunately for\nmy purpose, it proved that there was nobody in.\nThere are only two men, in any case, and they\nneglect their business a good deal. I had an excuse\nif one was needed, but when I found myself alone\nin the garage I flung caution to the winds. There was\na cardcase inside which shewed me which was\nMottram\u2019s car. My investigations led me to the\nconclusion that the car was in readiness for an immediate\nand secret departure for some considerable journey.\u201d \u201cDo tell us what they were,\u201d said Angela\ndemurely. \u201cJust for the interest of the thing.\u201d \u201cWell, I removed with some difficulty a kind of\ncap from that thing behind, which put me in a\nposition to examine the interior of what is, I suspect,\ncalled the petrol-tank. The careful insertion of a\npencil shewed that the tank was quite full; which\nsuggested that a refill had been obtained since they\narrived.\u201d \u201cThey might have run short on the journey down,\na mile or two out,\u201d suggested Angela. \u201cBut this was\nnot all?\u201d \u201cNo, there was a map lying on the driver\u2019s seat,\nsomewhat carelessly folded up. I thought it a point\nof interest that this map did not include Pullford,\nand seemed to contemplate an expedition to the west\nor southwest.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a great deal in that,\u201d said Bredon.\n\u201cStill, it\u2019s suggestive. Anything else?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, I lifted up one of the seats, and\nfound there a collection of sandwiches and a large\nflask of whisky.\u201d \u201cThe devil you did! But they might have been\nfor the journey down here. Did you taste the\nsandwiches to see if they were fresh?\u201d \u201cI took that liberty. They seemed to me, I must\nsay, a trifle on the stale side. But who was I to\ncomplain? I was, as it were, a guest. Meanwhile, let me\npoint out to you the improbability of Mottram\u2019s\nloading up his car with sandwiches for a\ntwenty-mile drive.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true. Were they properly cut?\nProfessional work, I mean?\u201d \u201cI suspected the hand of the artist. Mrs. Davis,\nno doubt. The whisky I did not feel at liberty to\nbroach. But the idea suggested itself to me that\nthese were the preparations of a man who is\ncontemplating a considerable journey, and probably one\nwhich will not allow him time to take his meals at\na public-house.\u201d \u201cAnd why a secret departure?\u201d \u201cWhy, somebody had induced a coat of black\npaint over what I take to be the number-plate of\nthe car. I am a mere novice in such matters, but is\nthat usual?\u201d \u201cIt is not frequently done. And was the paint still\nwet?\u201d \u201cThat is a curious point. The paint was dry. I\nsupposed then, that Brinkman\u2019s preparations for\ndeparture were not made yesterday or the day\nbefore.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s awfully kind of you to take all this trouble,\nand to come and tell us.\u201d \u201cNot at all. I thought perhaps it might be worth\nmentioning, in case you thought it best, well, to\nlay hands somehow on Brinkman.\u201d \u201cWhy, Mr. Pulteney,\u201d said Angela, bubbling over,\n\u201cwe were just preparing to lay hands on you!\u201d",
        "The bewilderment registered by Mr.\nPulteney\u2019s face at this extraordinary\nannouncement rapidly gave way to a look of intense\ngratification. \u201cAt last,\u201d he said, \u201cI have lived! To\nbe mistaken for a criminal, perhaps a murderer\u2014it\nis my nunc dimittis. All these years I have lived\nthe blameless life of one who is continually called\nupon to edify his juniors; I have risen early in order\nto convict my pupils of the sin of being late; I\nhave eaten sparingly in order to pretend that the\nfood provided by our establishment is satisfying\nwhen it is not; I have pretended to sentiments of\npatriotism, of rugged sportsmanship, of moral\napproval or indignation, which I did not feel. There\nis little to choose, believe me, between the fakir\nand the schoolmaster; either must spend days of\nwearisome mortification, because that is the way\nin which he gets his living. And now, for one\ncrowded hour of glorious old age, I have been\nmistaken for a guilty intriguer. The blood flows richer\nin my veins; I am overcome with gratitude. If only\nI could have kept it up!\u201d \u201cMr. Eames,\u201d said Angela, \u201cthere\u2019s one thing you\nsaid which you\u2019ve got to take back. You said Mr.\nPulteney was too much a man of reflection to be a\nman of action as well. And now you\u2019ve heard how\nhe broke into a garage, stole a piece of sandwich,\nand took the cap off a petrol-tank without being\nin the least certain that the car wouldn\u2019t explode.\nIs this the pale scholar you pictured to us?\u201d \u201cI apologize,\u201d said Eames. \u201cI apologize to Mr.\nPulteney unreservedly. I will form no more\njudgments of character. You may tell me that Mrs.\nDavis is a murderess, if you will, and I will discuss\nthe proposition on its merits.\u201d \u201cTalking of which,\u201d said Angela, \u201cthe cream of\nthe situation is that we still don\u2019t know who it was\nthat was rubbering behind that beastly mill-house.\u201d \u201cOh, as to that,\u201d said Eames diffidently, \u201cI\u2019ve felt\nfairly certain about that all along. I suppose it\u2019s the\nresult of living with priests that one becomes thus\nworldly wise. But didn\u2019t you know, Mr. Bredon, that\nmaids always steal their masters\u2019 cigarettes? It is,\nI believe, a more or less recognized form of\nperquisite. Every liberty taken by the rich is aped by their\ndomestics. And, although she is not in household\nservice, I have no doubt that the barmaid here\nclaims a like privilege.\u201d \u201cDo you mean\u201d\u2014\u2014 began Bredon: \u201cYou noticed, surely, that her fingers are a little\nstained with brown? I noticed it when she brought\nin my fried eggs. Ladies generally have expensive\ntastes in cigarettes, and I have no doubt that this\nmaid would go for the Callipoli if she got a chance.\u201d \u201cMiles, dear,\u201d said Angela softly, \u201cwho was it\nsaid that it must be a servant who was listening at\nour bedroom door?\u201d \u201cThe uneducated do not take Mr. Pulteney\u2019s view\nabout curiosity. I daresay this young lady often\nlistens at keyholes. With a corpse in the house, and\ndetectives about, she listens with all the more\navidity. And if the detectives insist on exchanging\nconfidences close to that precise point in the\nshrubbery at which she is in the habit of smoking\npurloined cigarettes, they put themselves in her hands.\nBut a stronger motive supervenes; what she\noverhears out of pure curiosity turns out to be of vital\nimportance to herself. She learns that the young\nman she is walking out with is suspected of\nmurder.\u201d \u201cGood Lord, and of course it was she who reacted\non our suggestions, not Brinkman! I don\u2019t know if\nI mentioned it to you, Angela, but when Leyland\nand I were talking together at the mill-house, he\nsaid the only thing that would make him hesitate to\narrest Simmonds would be evidence shewing that\nSimmonds knew he wasn\u2019t Mottram\u2019s heir. And it\nwas exactly that evidence which \u2018Raight-ho\u2019\nproceeded to produce.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d cried Angela, \u201cHow perfectly odious! You\nmean that when I thought I was pumping Emmeline\nso cleverly, and getting out of her exactly what I\nwanted, she was really doing it all on purpose, and\ntelling me exactly what she wanted?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, my dear. A lot of reputations\nseem to be going west to-day. And, of course, I\nshould say it\u2019s odds that her whole story was\nabsolutely trumped up, invented to suit the occasion.\nAnd we\u2019re back exactly where we were, not\nknowing whether Simmonds knew he was cut out of the\nwill or not.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d said Angela, \u201cwe do know,\nnow, what put the wind up young Simmonds so\nbadly. When you and Leyland passed him and\nEmmeline in the lane last night, she was telling him\nthat he was suspected of murder, and had better be\ndashed careful what he said and who he said it to.\nNaturally it gave him a bit of a fright when he\nthought you were going to pump him about his\nuncle.\u201d \u201cAnd meanwhile, what has Brinkman been up to?\nWe\u2019ve really no evidence against him until all this\nabout the car cropped up. Dash it all, and just when\nI was going to get a game of patience!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to put my oar in unduly,\u201d said\nthe old gentleman in an apologetic tone, \u201cbut might\nit not be a good thing to acquaint Mr. Leyland with\nthe somewhat unusual state of affairs down at the\ngarage? If Brinkman really intends to do what is\npopularly known as a \u2018bunk,\u2019 he may be off at any\nmoment. Had I been more expert, I could no doubt\nhave immobilized some important part of the\nmechanism. As it was, I was helpless.\u201d \u201cWhere is Leyland, by the way?\u201d asked Bredon. \u201cHe is just coming up the street now,\u201d said\nEames, looking out of the window. \u201cI\u2019ll call to him\nto come in here.\u201d \u201cHullo, what have you been up to?\u201d asked\nBredon, as Leyland entered. \u201cWhy, to tell the truth, I have been shadowing\nMr. Pulteney. I must apologize, Mr. Pulteney, but\nI felt bound to be careful. I\u2019ve had you kept under\nclose observation all this week; and it was only as I\nstood behind the door, watching your investigations\ninto that car, that I became perfectly convinced of\nyour innocence.\u201d \u201cWhat! more suspicion! This is indeed a day!\nWhy, if I had had the least conception that you were\nwatching me, Mr. Leyland, I would have led you a\nrare dance! My movements, I promise you, should\nhave been full of mystery. I should have gone out\nevery night with a scowl and a dark lantern. I am\noverwhelmed.\u201d \u201cWell, I must apologize at least for spying upon\nyour detective work. You do very well for an\namateur, Mr. Pulteney, but you are not suspicious\nenough.\u201d \u201cIndeed! I overlooked something? How\nmortifying!\u201d \u201cYes, when you took the cushion off that front\nseat, you failed to observe that there was a neat tear\nin it, which had been quite recently sewn up.\nOtherwise I am sure that you would have done what I did\njust now\u2014cut it open.\u201d \u201cAnd is it fair to ask what you found inside?\u201d \u201cWell, we seem to have gone too far now to have\nany secrets between us. I feel sure that both you,\nMr. Pulteney, and you, Mr. Eames, are anxious to\nsee justice done, and are prepared to help at least\nby your silence.\u201d \u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Pulteney. \u201cI am at your service,\u201d said Eames. \u201cWell, this is actually what I found.\u201d With a\ndramatic gesture he produced a small waterproof\nwallet, and turned out its contents. \u201cYou will find\na thousand pounds there, all in Bank of England\nnotes.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Bredon, when the exclamations of\nsurprise had died away, \u201care you still suspecting\nyoung Simmonds?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not easy about him yet in my own mind.\nBut of course I see Brinkman\u2019s deeper in this\nbusiness than I had suspected so far. A man who\u2019s\ninnocent doesn\u2019t prepare to do a bolt with a\nthousand pounds and a motor-car that doesn\u2019t belong to\nhim.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Bredon, \u201cI suppose we ought to be\nkeeping an eye on Mr. Brinkman.\u201d \u201cMy dear old thing,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cdon\u2019t you\nrealize that I\u2019ve had two of my men at the Swan\nall this week, and that Brinkman hasn\u2019t been\nunaccounted for for one moment? The trouble is, he\nknows he\u2019s being watched, so he won\u2019t give\nhimself away. At least I\u2019m pretty sure of it. But the\nmotor, of course, puts us in a very good position.\nWe know how he means to escape, and we can\nafford to take the watch off him and put it on the\nmotor instead. Then he\u2019ll shew his hand, because\nhe\u2019s mad keen to be off. At present he\u2019s in his room,\nsmoking a cigarette and reading an old novel. He\nwon\u2019t move, I think, until he makes certain that\nwe\u2019re all out of the way. Probably not till after\nsupper, because a night ride will suit his purpose\nbest. And he\u2019s got a night for it too; there\u2019s a big\nstorm coming on, unless I\u2019m mistaken.\u201d \u201cAnd what about Simmonds?\u201d asked Bredon. \u201cAnd the barmaid?\u201d added Angela. \u201cWell, of course I could question both or either of\nthem. But I\u2019d sooner not, if I can help it; it\u2019s cruel\nwork, I was wondering if you, Mrs. Bredon, could\ngo and have a talk to that maid after we\u2019ve had our\ntea, and see what satisfaction you can get out of\nher?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. In fact, I rather want to have\nit out with dear Emmeline. I owe her one, you see.\nMeanwhile, let\u2019s have tea by all means. I wonder if\nBrinky will come down to it?\u201d Brinkman did come down, and tea was not a very\nenlivening meal. Everybody in the room looked upon\nhim as a man who was probably a murderer and\ncertainly a thief. Consequently everybody tried to be\nnice to him, and everybody\u2019s style was cramped by\nthe effort. Even Mr. Pulteney\u2019s verbosity seemed\nto have been dried up by the embarrassment of the\nsituation. On the whole, Eames carried it off best.\nHis dry, melancholy manner was quite unaltered;\nhe talked about patience to Bredon, he talked\nPullford gossip to Brinkman; he tried to draw out\nPulteney on educational questions. But most of the\nparty were glad when it was over, when Brinkman\nhad shut himself up again, and Angela had betaken\nherself to the back premises to have it out with the\nbarmaid. The \u201cbest room\u201d had been turned by common\nconsent into a sort of committee room; during all\nthis whirligig of sensations, the background of their\nmind was filled with those protuberant portraits of\nthe late Mr. Davis which so defiantly occupied the\nwalls. It was here that Angela found them assembled\nwhen she came up, some half an hour later, a little\nred about the eyes. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t try any subterfuges this time; I\nlet her have it straight from the shoulder. And then\nshe cried, and I cried, and we both cried together\na good bit.\u201d \u201cThe mysterious sex again,\u201d said Mr. Pulteney. \u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t understand, of course. Anyhow,\nshe\u2019s had a rotten time. That first evening, when she\nlistened outside the door, it was only for a moment\nor two, out of sheer curiosity, and she didn\u2019t hear\nanything that interested her. It was yesterday\nevening, when you two were talking, that she got\ninterested. She overheard at first merely by accident,\nwhich just shews how careful you ought to be. She\ncaught the name \u2018Simmonds\u2019; she heard, for the first\ntime, about the Euthanasia policy, and what it might\nhave meant to him and to her. She went on\nlistening, naturally, and so she came in for all Mr.\nLeyland\u2019s exposition of the case against Simmonds. You\ndidn\u2019t convince my husband, Mr. Leyland, but you\nhad a much greater success on the other side of the\nwall. The poor girl, who\u2019s been brought up on\nnovelettes and penny-shockers all her life, drank in the\nwhole story. She really believed that the man who\nhad been making love to her, the man she was in\nlove with, was a cold-blooded murderer. She acted\nI think, very well. He came round that evening to\ntake her out for an evening walk, and on the way\nshe taxed him with his supposed crime. If you come\nto think of it, that was sporting of her.\u201d \u201cIt was,\u201d said Leyland. \u201cPeople are found dead\nin ditches for less than that.\u201d \u201cWell, anyhow, it worked all right. Simmonds\nlistened to her charges, and then denied them all.\nHe didn\u2019t give her any evidence for his denial, but\nshe believed him. There was no quarrel. Next day,\nthat is to say this morning, Emmeline heard you two\narranging for a talk at the mill-house. She didn\u2019t\nsuspect the trap; she walked straight into it. What\nshe heard made her believe that there was only one\nway to save Simmonds\u2014to pretend that he knew\nabout the Euthanasia, and knew the money wasn\u2019t\ncoming to him. The poor girl reflected that\nSimmonds had been hanging round the house on the\nnight of Mottram\u2019s death; he had been there waiting\nto see her when she left the bar at closing time. So,\nbravely again, I think, she came to me with her\nstory about the anonymous friend and her young\nman with his lost legacy. Of course, by sheer\naccident, I made it much easier for her to pitch me\nthis yarn, and I swallowed it whole. She thought\nthat, with some blackening of her own conscience,\nshe had saved an innocent man\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s all she knows, so far?\u201d \u201cNo, at the end of lunch she heard you, Miles,\nsaying that you\u2019d give me half an hour to talk\nthings over. So when she saw us stealing down to\nthe now familiar trysting-place by the mill\u2014she\nhadn\u2019t gone to the funeral\u2014she followed us and\nlistened again. And, to her horror, she realized from\nwhat you said that all her lying had failed to do its\nwork. Leyland still believed, believed more than\never, that her young man was the criminal. Her\nanxiety put her off her guard, and a sudden sneeze\ngave her away. She didn\u2019t dare go back to the house;\nshe hid in the privet-hedge.\u201d \u201cAnd the long and short of it is,\u201d suggested\nLeyland, \u201cthat her story is no evidence at all. Simmonds\nmay be as guilty or as innocent as you like; she\nknew nothing about it. Can she give any account of\nSimmonds\u2019s movements on the night of the\nmurder?\u201d \u201cWell, she says she had to be in the bar up to\nclosing time, and then she slipped round to the back\ndoor, where he was waiting for her, and stood there\ntalking to him.\u201d \u201cFor how long?\u201d \u201cShe says it might have been a quarter of an hour,\nor it might have been three quarters of an hour; she\nreally couldn\u2019t say.\u201d \u201cThat sounds pretty thin.\u201d \u201cHow impossible you bachelors are! Miles, can\u2019t\nyou explain to him? Oh, well, I suppose it\u2019s no use;\nyou couldn\u2019t possibly understand.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s certainly rather an unfortunate circumstance\nfor Simmonds that, just at the moment the gas was\nturned on in Mottram\u2019s room, he was indulging in a\nkind of ecstasy which may have lasted a quarter of\nan hour, or may have lasted three quarters.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said Bredon, \u201cI hope you realize\nthat your own case against Simmonds is considerably\nweakened? You were trying to make out, if you\nremember, that Simmonds murdered Mottram and\nburned the will, knowing that the will cut him out\nof his inheritance. But since we have learned to\ndiscredit the testimony of \u2018Raight-ho,\u2019 we have no\nevidence that Simmonds ever knew anything about the\nwill, or had ever so much as heard of the Euthanasia\npolicy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true. And it\u2019s also true that these last\ndiscoveries have made me more inclined to suspect\nBrinkman. I shall have to keep my eye on\nSimmonds, but for the time being Brinkman is the\nquarry we must hunt. It\u2019s Brinkman\u2019s confession\nI look forward to for the prospect of those forty\npounds.\u201d \u201cWell, if you can catch Brinkman and make him\nconfess, you\u2019re welcome to them. Or even if\nBrinkman does himself in somehow, commits suicide rather\nthan face the question, I\u2019ll give you the benefit of\nthe doubt, and we\u2019ll treat it as murder. Meanwhile,\nif you will excuse me, I think I\u2019ve just time to lay\nout that patience before supper.\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s hopeless,\u201d said Angela.",
        "Bredon was not allowed to escape so easily.\nLeyland insisted that their plans must be\nsettled at once, before supper time. \u201cYou see,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make rings round Brinkman,\nand he\u2019s got to fancy that he is not under\nobservation. That\u2019s going to be a difficult job. But it\u2019s made\neasy for us, rather, by the fact that Friday night\nis cinema night in Chilthorpe.\u201d \u201cA cinema at Chilthorpe!\u201d protested Mr.\nPulteney. \u201cGood God!\u201d \u201cYes, there\u2019s a sort of barn out behind the\nrectory, and one of these travelling shows comes round\nonce a week or once a fortnight. It\u2019s extraordinary\nhow civilization has developed, isn\u2019t it? My idea was\nthis: our friend the barmaid is to come in at supper,\nand ask us if we shall be wanting anything for the\nnight, and whether she can go out. The Boots, she\nwill say quite truthfully, is going to the cinema, and\nshe wants to do the same. Mrs. Davis will be kept\nbusy at the bar. Therefore there will be nobody to\nattend to the bell if we ring\u2014she will ask us whether\nwe mind that.\u201d \u201cMachiavellian!\u201d said Mr. Pulteney. \u201cThen somebody\u2014you, Mrs. Bredon, for choice\u2014will\nsuggest our making up a party for the cinema.\nYour husband will refuse, because he wants to stay\nat home playing patience.\u201d \u201cCome, I like this scheme,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cIt\nseems to me to be all on the right lines. I only hope\nthat you will allow me to be as good as my word.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right; I\u2019m coming to that. The rest of\nus will consent to accompany Mrs. Bredon;\nBrinkman, presumably, will refuse. Soon after\nsupper\u2014the performance is at eight\u2014we will all leave the\nhouse in the direction of the cinema, which is\nfortunately the opposite direction from the garage.\u201d \u201cAnd have I got to sit through an evening\nperformance in the barn?\u201d asked Angela. \u201cWhy, no; I want you and Mr. Eames to make\nyour way back to the inn, by turning off along the\nlane which leads to the old mill; then you can come\nin quietly by the privet-hedge at the back. Then I\nwant you, Mr. Eames, to wait about in the passage\nwhich leads to the bar, dodging down the cellar\nstairs if Brinkman comes to the bar to have a\nfortifier on his way. I hope your reputation will not\nsuffer from these movements. You will keep your\neye on the front of the house, in case Brinkman goes\nout that way.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a fool if he does,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cIn the first\nplace, it\u2019s a shorter way to the garage to take the\npath that goes out at the back. And in the second\nplace, if he takes that path he will be unnoticed,\nwhereas if he comes out by the front door he will\nbe under the eyes of the bar parlour.\u201d \u201cI know, and I am going to discourage him still\nfurther from going out at the front by leaving you\nto keep a lookout. Your window faces the front,\ndoesn\u2019t it? Very well, then, you will sit in your room\nplaying patience, but right in the window-seat,\nplease, and with the blind up.\u201d \u201cBut I say, if he goes out by the front way, have\nI got to track him? Because\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. Mr. Eames is to do that. You\nsit still where you are and go on playing patience.\nMr. Eames, if Brinkman goes out by the front door,\nyou will see him; you will wait till he is round the\ncorner, and then follow him at a distance. That, of\ncourse, is only to make sure what he does on the\nway to the garage; you are not to overtake him or\ninterfere with him.\u201d \u201cI see.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do?\u201d asked Angela. \u201cWell, I was wondering if, on returning from our\nfalse start, you would mind going up unnoticed to\nyour husband\u2019s room? The back stairs are very\nhandy for the purpose. You could sit there reading,\nor anything, and then if Brinkman does leave by the\nfront, your husband, while still sitting at the window\nand pretending not to notice, could pass the word to\nyou. You would then go downstairs and ring up the\ngarage, so that we shall be ready for Brinkman when\nhe comes.\u201d \u201cThat will be a thoroughly typical scene. And are\nyou taking poor Mr. Pulteney to the post of honour\nand of danger?\u201d \u201cIf Mr. Pulteney does not object. He knows his\nway about the garage.\u201d \u201cI shall be delighted to go where glory waits. If I\nfall, I hope that you will put up a plain but tasteful\nmonument over me, indicating that I died doing\nsomebody else\u2019s duty.\u201d \u201cAnd what about your two men?\u201d asked Bredon. \u201cOne of them will be told off to watch Simmonds.\nAs I told you, I can\u2019t afford to leave Simmonds out\nof account. The other will wait out at the back, in a\nplace I have selected; if (or rather when) Brinkman\ncomes out at the back door to make his way to the\ngarage, my man will follow him at a distance, and\nwill take his post at the garage door, in case there\u2019s\nany rough work there. That, I think, accounts for\nthe whole party.\u201d \u201cHow long does our vigil last?\u201d asked Eames. \u201cNot, I imagine beyond nine o\u2019clock. That is the\nhour at which the garage shuts; and, although there\nis a bell by which the proprietor can be fetched out\nif necessary, I hardly think that Brinkman would\ntake the risk. The dusk is closing early this evening,\nwith all these clouds about; and if, as I strongly\nsuspect, there is a thunder-storm, it will be a capital\nnight for his purpose. It\u2019s a nuisance for us, because\nI haven\u2019t dared to leave any of my watching-parties\nout of doors for fear of a deluge.\u201d If tea had been an embarrassing meal, supper was\na positive nightmare. But when the barmaid,\ncarefully coached by Angela, asked for leave to go out\nto the pictures, a perfect piece of acting began.\nAngela\u2019s suggestion to her husband was beautifully\ndone, so was his languid reply; Mr. Pulteney\nexcelled himself in the eagerness with which he offered\nto be her cavalier; Leyland\u2019s shew of reluctance over\nthe programme, and Eames\u2019s humorous resignation\nto his fate, completed the picture. Brinkman, after\none nerve-racking pause, said he thought on the\nwhole he would rather be excused. He found the\ncinema tiring to the eyes. \u201cGood,\u201d said Bredon;\n\u201cthen you and I will keep the home-fires burning.\nIt\u2019s true I shall be sitting upstairs, because I\u2019ve got\nmy patience all laid out up there, and I haven\u2019t the\nheart to desert it. But if you\u2019re frightened of\nthunder, Mr. Brinkman, you can always come up and\nhave a crack with me.\u201d The alleged cinema party left at five minutes to\neight. By that time Bredon was already immersed in\nhis mysteries upstairs; and it was Brinkman,\nsmilingly apologetic, who saw them off at the front door.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit up for us if we\u2019re late, Mr. Brinkman,\u201d\nsaid Angela, with the woman\u2019s instinct of overdoing\nan acted part; \u201cwe\u2019ll throw brickbats in at my\nhusband\u2019s window.\u201d The inn door, with its ridiculous\npanes of blue and yellow, shut behind them, and\nthey heard the unsuspecting footsteps of their\nvictim climbing the stairs. As they passed down the\nstreet, a few drops of rain were falling, uneasy\npresages of the storm. Angela quickened her pace;\nshe had not carried realism to the extent of arming\nherself with an umbrella. It was, in truth, but a short\ndistance she and Eames had to travel; they were\nonly just out of sight round a bend of the street\nwhen they doubled back upon the lane by which they\nwere to return to the inn. At the entrance of it they\nmet Emmeline, with the Boots in attendance; it\nwas difficult not to believe that, upon arrival at the\ncinema, he would be replaced by a more favoured\nescort. Leyland and Pulteney just stood long enough\nat the turning to make sure that all had gone well,\nand then continued their journey to the garage. Here all was clearly in readiness; the proprietor\nwas waiting for them at the door to receive his\norders. \u201cLook here,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cthis gentleman and\nI are going to watch for a bit in here. Where\u2019s the\ntelephone? Ah, that\u2019s all right; very well, we\u2019ll get\nbehind this lorry. If anybody comes into the garage\nand wants you, he can ring that bell, can\u2019t he? And\nif anybody rings up on the telephone, we\u2019ll take the\nmessage; and if it\u2019s for you, not for us, we\u2019ll let you\nknow. Meanwhile, I suppose you and your mate can\nkeep in the background?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, sir, there won\u2019t be any difficulty\nabout that. About how long might you be requiring\nthe use of the garage for, sir?\u201d \u201cTill nine o\u2019clock\u2014that\u2019s your closing time, isn\u2019t\nit? Any objections?\u201d \u201cThere ain\u2019t no difficulty, sir, except that I\u2019ve got\nto take my car out: I\u2019ve got to meet a gentleman\nwho\u2019s coming down on the 8.40 train. But if I take\nit straight out, and don\u2019t waste any time over it,\nthat\u2019ll be all right, won\u2019t it? She\u2019s all ready for\nstarting.\u201d \u201cVery well. Twenty minutes to nine\u2014or I suppose\nyou\u2019ll want it about twenty-five to. Well, you may\nsee us when you come back, or you may not. There\u2019s\nnothing else, then.\u201d As the proprietor withdrew behind the door which\nled into the workshop at the back, Leyland and\nPulteney took up their stand behind a hay-waggon\nwhich afforded them generous concealment. Even as\nthey did so, a sudden wink of lightning illuminated\nthe outlines of the garage and the road outside; it\nwas followed by a distant sound of thunder. The\nwind had got up by now, and was moaning uneasily\namong the rafters of the building, which was no\nbetter than an open barn. \u201cOur performance could hardly have been better\nstaged,\u201d murmured the old gentleman. \u201cI only\nregret the absence of a revolver. Not that I should\nhave any idea how to use a lethal weapon, but it\nwould give me more sense of derring do. It is\nsingularly unfortunate that, even if I narrate the events\nof this evening to my pupils next term, they will not\nbelieve me. They suspect any information which\ncomes from such a source. To you, I suppose, this\nis an everyday affair?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you believe it, Mr. Pulteney. Most of a\ndetective\u2019s life is spent sitting in an office filling up\nforms, like any bank clerk. I\u2019ve got a revolver with\nme myself, but I\u2019m not expecting any shooting.\nBrinkman doesn\u2019t strike me as being that kind of\ncustomer.\u201d \u201cIs it intended that I should precipitate myself\nupon the miscreant and overpower him, or where\nexactly do my services come in?\u201d Leyland was rather at a loss to answer. The truth\nwas, he did not quite trust Mr. Pulteney, and he\nthought it best for that reason to keep him by his\nside. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201ctwo heads are better than one\nif it comes to a sudden alteration of plans. But there\nisn\u2019t going to be any difficulty about catching our\nfriend. If he comes out by the back, he\u2019ll have my\nman shadowing him. If he should come out by the\nfront, he will have Mr. Eames shadowing him. So\nhe will be caught between two fires.\u201d \u201cBut it might be difficult for Mr. Eames to catch\nhim if he were already in the motor-car and driving\nit.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that, Mr. Pulteney. I\u2019ve\nfixed that car so that nobody\u2019s going to get her to\nmove unless I want him to. It\u2019s the devil of a night,\nthis. I hope Brinkman won\u2019t funk it.\u201d They seemed, indeed, to be in the very centre of a\nthunder-storm, though it was nowhere quite close\nat hand. Every few seconds, from some unexpected\nquarter, the whole sky seemed to wink twice in\nrapid succession, and with the wink the roofs of\nChilthorpe would suddenly stand out silhouetted,\nand a pale glare fell on the white road outside. Rain\nlashed upon the roof above them, and for a few\nminutes every gutter spouted and every seam in the\ntiles let in a pattering flood; then, without a word\nof warning, the rain would die down once more.\nOccasionally the lightning would manifest itself closer,\ngreat jagged streaks across the sky that looked as if\nthey were burying themselves in the hill summits\nabove the town. When the elements were at rest for\na moment, there was an uncanny stillness on every\nside; not a dog barked, not a footstep clattered down\nthe deserted street. Attuned as their nerves were to the thunder, they\nboth started as if in panic when the telephone bell\nrang. Leyland was at the instrument in a moment,\nand heard Angela\u2019s cool voice asking for him at the\nother end. \u201cIs that you, Mr. Leyland? Brinkman has just\nleft the hotel by the front door.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Yes, the front\ndoor. I didn\u2019t see him myself, of course, but my\nhusband said he came out quite coolly, just looking up\nat our window as if to see whether he was watched.\nThen I came straight to the telephone. I just looked\nin at the bar passage, and found that Mr. Eames was\nnot there, so I suppose he has followed. Shall I give\nany message to the man at the back? Oh, all\nright.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Yes, he was carrying a despatch-box, which\nlooks as if he would round up with you before\nlong.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. All right, we\u2019ll expect you when we see\nyou.\u201d \u201cThat sounds all right,\u201d said Leyland to his\ncompanion. \u201cWe\u2019d best take cover. Though why on\nearth the man came out by the front door\u2014Gad, he\nmust be a cool customer! To walk out with his bag\nfrom the front door, and wander in here asking for\nhis car! Keep well behind the lorry, Mr.\nPulteney.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Hullo, what\u2019s that?\u201d The door of the workshop opened, and the\nproprietor appeared, drawing on a pair of\nmotoring-gloves. \u201cSorry, sir, it\u2019s twenty-five to; got to go and\npick up my gent. Bad night for a drive, with the rain\non your wind-screen, and this lightning blinding you\nevery other second.\u201d \u201cHurry up, man, get clear,\u201d said Leyland\nimpatiently. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here in a moment. As you come\nback, you might stop at the Load of Mischief,\nbecause we may want a car.\u201d There was a drumming and a grinding, and the\ntaxi bounded out on to the roadway. Leyland and\nPulteney drew back behind the lorry, and waited for\nthe sound of a footfall. They heard the hoot of the\ntaxi as it passed the turning at the bridge; they\nheard the scrape as it changed gears a little late on\nthe hill road; then the noise died down, and there\nwas silence. Two flashes of lightning, with the\nthunder following quick on them; then silence again.\nFive minutes passed, ten minutes, and still they sat\non in the half-darkness. Leyland\u2019s mind was in a\nwhirl of agitation. Granted that Brinkman had taken\nsome circuitous route, to avoid observation, was it\nlikely that he should take so long as this? He had\nhad time to carry his luggage all round the\ntownship by now.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Suddenly, from up the street,\ncame a sound of running footsteps. Leyland gripped\nhis revolver and waited with drawn breath.",
        "Bredon had undoubtedly secured the best\noccupation for the evening. For two whole days\nhe had missed the feeling of cards between\nhis hands, and now he returned with a great hunger\nto his favourite pastime. True, the circumstances\nwere not ideal. It was thoughtless of Leyland to have\ninsisted on his sitting so close to the window; there\nwas, fortunately, a window-seat, but not generous\nenough in its proportions to secure a convenient\nlay-out of the cards. The rows, instead of lying flat,\nhad to climb over downs and gullies in the faded\nchintz; the result was an occasional avalanche, and\na corresponding loss of temper. In an ideal world,\nBredon reflected, you would have a large building\nlike a racquet-court to play patience in, and you\nwould wheel yourself up and down between the rows\nin an invalid\u2019s chair. There was a soft rustle at the door, and Angela\ncame in. \u201cOo, I\u2019ve been feeling so nice and stealthy,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cMr. Eames and I crept back down the\nlane like burglars. It was better than a cinema, I can\ntell you! We dodged round the privet-hedge, and\ncame in through the back of Mrs. Davis\u2019s kitchen.\nAnd I thought the back stairs would never stop\ncreaking. Did you hear me coming up?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say I did. But you see, I was otherwise\nengaged. To a man like Brinkman, on the alert for\nevery noise, your progress probably sounded like\na charge of cavalry. You\u2019re sure you shut the door\nproperly? I need hardly say that a sudden draught\nwould be a disaster to all my best hopes. A little\nknitting is indicated for you, Angela, to steady the\nmind.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you talk too much. If Brinky came out and\nsaw your lips moving it might worry him. Remember,\nyou\u2019re supposed to be alone in the room. Though\nindeed he probably regards you as potty by now in\nany case, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise him to see you\ntalking to yourself. Words cannot depict the shame\nI have felt this evening at having such a lazy\nhusband. Talk of Nero fiddling while Rome was\nburning!\u201d \u201cSay rather, Drake insisting on finishing his game\nof bowls. Or was it William Tell? I forget. Anyhow,\nthis is the fine old British spirit. What\u2019s the word?\nNot undaunted\u2014imperturbable, that\u2019s what I mean.\nThe myrmidons of Scotland Yard bustle to and fro\noutside; the great detective sits calmly within, with\nall the strings in his hands. My nets begin to close\ntighter round them, Watson. Dash it all, I believe\nPulteney\u2019s let me down. Where\u2019s his other two of\nspades?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be unpleasant, but you will\nperhaps allow me to remind you that you are supposed\nto be on the lookout. If Brinky comes out in front,\nyou are to report to me. And how are you to see him,\nif you will go scavenging about under the\nwindow-seat like that?\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019ll jolly well have to find my two of\nspades, then, while I keep an eye on the street. Fair\ndivision of labour. Watchman, what of the night?\nThere\u2019s going to be a jolly fine thunder-storm. Did\nyou see that flash? I deduce that there will shortly\nbe a slight roll of thunder. There, what did I tell\nyou?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the innate laziness of the man,\u201d\nmurmured Angela, as if to herself, \u201cit\u2019s his\nself-sufficiency! Here\u2019s your beastly two of spades; don\u2019t\nlose it again. You ought to have the cards tied round\nyour neck with a piece of string. I say, aren\u2019t you\nexcited? Do you think Brinky will show fight when\nthey nab him in the garage?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fluster me. I wish to be secluded from the\nworld. Here before me lies a very pretty problem,\nrepresented by two hundred and eight pieces of\npasteboard. Behind that, in the dim background of my\nhalf-awake consciousness, lies a very pretty\nproblem in detection. It is my boast that I can do both\nat once. But how am I to do either if women will\nchatter at me?\u201d \u201cPassengers are requested not to speak to the\nman at the wheel. All right, Aunty, go on with your\nsilly game. I\u2019m going to knit. It doesn\u2019t feel quite\nwomanly to knit, somehow, with a thing like you\nin the room.\u201d There was silence for a while, as Bredon sat over\nhis cards, with an occasional glance at the street\nbelow him. There is said to be a man who has\ninvented a Chinese typewriter; and since (they tell\nus) every word in the Chinese language has its own\nsymbol\u2014the fault of Confucius, for not thinking\nof letters\u2014the machine is said to be of the size and\nshape of a vast organ, and the typist runs to and fro,\npulling out a stop here, pressing down a pedal there,\nin a whirl of activity. Not otherwise did Bredon\nappear when he saw the possibilities of a particular\ngambit in his patience; then he would sit for a while\nlost in thought, puzzling out combinations for the\nfuture. Below him, the street lay in an unearthly\nhalf-darkness. Lamps should not have been needed\nby this time on a June evening, but the thick mantle\nof clouds had taken away all that was left of the\nsun\u2019s departing influence, and it was a twilit world\nthat lay below. He could see a broad splash of light\nfrom the front door, and, further along, the\nmellower radiance diffused by the bar windows, with\ntheir drawn red blinds. From time to time a\nsudden flare of lightning illuminated the whole prospect,\nand shamed these human lights into insignificance. \u201cAngela,\u201d said Bredon suddenly, without turning\nround, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it interests you at all, but\na stealthy figure has crept out into the moonlight.\nAt least, there isn\u2019t any moonlight, but still, those\nirritatingly twirled moustaches, that supercilious\npince-nez\u2014can it be? It is\u2014our old friend\nBrinkman. He carries a despatch-box, but no other\nluggage. He is passing down the street in the direction\nof the turning; perhaps making for the garage\u2014who\nshall say? He is looking round at this window. Ha!\n\u2019tis well, I am observed. Anyhow, it\u2019s up to you to go\nto the telephone this time.\u201d Angela\u2019s self-possession was more of a pose. She\nsprang up in a hurry, dropping her knitting as she\nrose, and threw the door open silently but swiftly;\nthen, as silently, as swiftly, it shut again behind her.\nBut not before irretrievable damage had been done.\nThe evening was full of those sudden gusts and\nair-currents which a thunder-storm brings with it. One\nof these, synchronizing with the sudden opening of\nthe door, neatly lifted up three of the cards from the\nwindow-seat, and swept them out into the open air. Bredon was intensely annoyed, and somewhat\npuzzled as to his duty. On the one hand, it was\nimpossible to go on with the game when three cards,\nwhose values he could not remember, were missing\nfrom a row. On the other hand, Leyland\u2019s\ninstructions had been explicit; he was to sit at the window\nwithout stirring. Then common sense came to his aid.\nAfter all, Brinkman was no longer in sight; even if\nhe were still watching from the corner, he would\nnever suspect that a movement in the room upstairs\nportended discovery. With a great effort Bredon\nheaved himself up from the chair into which he had\nsunk, opened the door delicately for fear of fresh\ndraughts, and in half a minute\u2019s time was searching\nbefore the front of the inn for his truant\npasteboard. The king of spades, good. And here was the three\nof diamonds. But there was one other card; he was\ncertain of it. A friendly flash of lightning gave him a\nsudden snapshot of the road; Brinkman was out of\nsight; another figure, Eames presumably, was\nalready making for the turning. But there was no\ncard in the street; no deceptive fragments of paper,\neven, to catch the eye. He looked round, baffled.\nThen his eye caught the sight of an open\nground-floor window, that of the \u201cbest room.\u201d Could the\nfluttering runaway have dived indoors again? He\nput his head in through the window; there it lay,\nclose to the occasional table with the photograph\nalbum on it. He was back through the front door in\nan instant, and making his way upstairs again with\nhis prize. \u201cGreat Scott!\u201d he said, aloud, as he regained his\nroom, \u201ccould that possibly be it? That would mean,\nof course\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. hang it all, what would that mean?\nAh! That\u2019s more like it.\u201d The patience lay all round\nhim, forgotten for the moment; his eyes sparkled,\nhis hands gripped the arms of his chair. When Angela came back from the telephone, she\nwas astonished at the change that had come over her\nhusband. He was standing on the fender with his\nback to the empty grate, swinging himself to and\nfro while he carolled a snatch from an out-of-date\nmusical repertoire: \u201cAll the girls began to cry, \u2018Hi, hi, hi, Mister Mackay, Take us with you when you fly back to the Isle of Skye,\u2019\u200a\u201d were the actual words that greeted her entrance. \u201cMiles, dear,\u201d she expostulated, \u201cwhatever\u2019s the\nmatter? Have you got it out?\u201d \u201cWhat, the patience? No, I don\u2019t think the\npatience is coming out just yet. But I\u2019ve got a very\nstrong suspicion that our little detective mystery is\ncoming out. As you are up, I wonder if it would be\ntroubling you too much to ask you to step down to\nMrs. Davis and ask her if she ever cut any\nsandwiches for Mr. Brinkman?\u201d \u201cMy poor, poor dear!\u201d said Angela; but she went.\nShe knew the signs of a victory in her husband\u2019s\nerratic deportment. He was still crooning softly to\nhimself when she came back with her message. \u201cMrs. Davis says that she doesn\u2019t remember ever\nto have cut any \u2018sangwiches,\u2019 not for Mr. Brinkman\nshe didn\u2019t. Mr. Pulteney, now, he often takes a nice\n\u2018sangwich\u2019 with him when he goes out fishing. Not\nthat she always makes them herself, because the girl\ncuts as nice a \u2018sangwich\u2019 as you\u2019d wish to see. But\nMr. Brinkman he didn\u2019t order any \u2018sangwiches,\u2019 not\nall this week he hasn\u2019t. That\u2019s all the message. At\nleast, I came away at that point.\u201d \u201cGood! The case progresses. Let me call your\nattention to this singular absence of \u2018sangwich\u2019-cutting\non the part of Mrs. Davis. Angela, I\u2019m right on the\ntrack of the beastly thing, and you mustn\u2019t disturb\nme.\u201d \u201cHave you really worked it all out?\u201d \u201cNo, not quite all; but I\u2019m in the sort of stage\nwhere the great detective says, \u2018Good God, what a\nblind bat I have been!\u2019 As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ve been a blind bat at all. On the contrary,\nI think it\u2019s dashed clever of me to have got hold\nof the thing now. It\u2019s more than you have.\u201d \u201cMiles, you\u2019re not to be odious. Tell me all about\nit, and I\u2019ll see what I think of you.\u201d \u201cWho was it laughed at me for staying at home\nand playing patience while other people did the\nwork? No, you shan\u2019t hear about it; besides I\nhaven\u2019t fitted it all together yet.\u201d \u201cWell, anyhow, you might tell me whether you\u2019ve\nwon the forty quid or lost it.\u201d \u201cNot a word shall you get out of me at present.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll make Mr. Leyland arrest you and\ntorture you with thumb-screws. By the way, I\nwonder what Mr. Leyland\u2019s doing? Brinky must have\ngot to the garage by now, and I should have thought\nhe would have brought him straight back here.\u201d \u201cThe garage? Oh, yes. At least, wait a minute.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nOf course, now I come to think of it, there\u2019s\nno real reason to suppose that Brinkman meant to\ntake the car out at all.\u201d",
        "Eames stood behind the window of the passage\ninto the bar parlour, making sure that there\nwas no light behind him to show a silhouette.\nYes, there was no doubt, it was Brinkman who had\nstepped out into the twilight of the street;\nBrinkman with a despatch-box in his hand; Brinkman\non the run. He waited until the street corner hid\nthe fugitive from view, then crammed on his soft\nhat and followed. He was not an expert at this sort\nof game, but fortunately there was not much to\nbe done. Brinkman would obviously make for the\ngarage, and when he had passed through the open\ndoors of it, it would be easy for him, Eames, to slink\nup behind and post himself outside the gateway to\nprevent a sudden rush. Hang it all, though, why\nhadn\u2019t the man gone out by the back lane? And then he saw that he had counted on his luck\ntoo soon. Brinkman had reached the turning, and\nhad not made for the garage after all. He had turned\nhis back on it, and was starting out on the\nPullford Road, the road toward the gorge and the Long\nPool. This was outside all their calculations; what\non earth could the man be up to? Not only was he\ndeserting his car, he was deserting the garage, and\nwith it all the available petrol-power of Chilthorpe.\nHe could not be walking to Pullford, a distance\nof twenty miles more or less. He could hardly even\nbe walking to Lowgill Junction, eight miles off,\nthough that would, of course, bring him onto the\nmain line. Chilthorpe Station would be hopeless at\nthis time of night; no strand remained to connect it\nwith civilization. No, if Brinkman took this road,\nhe must be taking it only to return along it. And yet, was it safe to reckon on that? Was it\nsafe to make straight for the garage, and warn\nLeyland of what was happening? If he did that, he must\nlet Brinkman out of his sight; and his orders were\nnot to let Brinkman out of his sight. Eames was in\nthe habit of obeying orders, and he obeyed. It\nwould need cautious going, for, if Brinkman turned\nin his tracks, it was not unlikely that he would walk\nstraight into the arms of his pursuer. Very cautiously\nthen, flattening himself in doorways or hiding behind\nclumps of broom and furze on the roadside, Eames\nstalked his man at a distance of some thirty yards.\nIt was difficult work in the half-darkness, but those\nsudden, revealing flashes of lightning made it\nunsafe to go nearer. They had left the last of the\nhouses, and were now reaching the forked roads a\nlittle way up the hill. If Brinkman took the lower\nroad, it must be Lowgill Junction he was making\nfor; that would make easy work for his pursuers,\nwho could ride him down in a fast motor. Surely it\ncould not be that; surely he could not be turning his\nback on the motor and the thousand pounds! No, he was not making for Lowgill. He took the\nhill turning instead; that led either to the railway\nstation or across the moors to Pullford. In either\ncase every step was taking the hunted man farther\naway from help. \u201cIf he goes as far as the first\nmilestone,\u201d Eames said to himself, \u201cI\u2019ll defy my orders\nand cut back to the garage, so that they can get the\ncar out and follow him. Confound it all, what\u2019s the\nman doing now?\u201d Brinkman had left the high road, and was making\nhis way deliberately down the field-path that led\nto the gorge. This was worse than ever; the path\nwas steep, and Eames, although he carried an\nelectric torch which Bredon had lent him, did not\ndare to use it for fear of betraying himself. He could\nnot guess the significance of this last move. There\nwas no road Brinkman could be making for, unless\nhe returned to this same road at the other end of the\ngorge, a few hundred yards higher up. Was it safe\nto wait at the beginning of the path? Was it safe\nto follow along the road, flanking his movements\nfrom above? Once more Eames had to fall back upon\nhis orders. There was only one way of keeping his\nman in sight, and that was to stick to his heels. It\nwould mean, probably, some nasty stumbles in the\nhalf-darkness, but it was too late to consider that.\nAt least, the fir-trees and the bracken made it easier\nto follow unseen. And the fir-trees kept off a little\nof the rain, which was now driving fiercely upon his\novercoat, and clogging the knees of his trousers with\ndamp. Never mind, he had his orders. Any kind of scenery achieves dignity in a\nthunder-storm; but rocky scenery in particular is ennobled\nby the combination. Under those quivering flashes,\nthe two sides of the valley with the river running in\nbetween looked like the wings of a gigantic\nbutterfly shaking off the pitiless dew that was falling on\nthem. The opening of the gorge itself, with the slant\nof the shadows as the lightning\u2019s glare failed to reach\nits depths, was like an illustration to the \u201cInferno.\u201d\nThe rain on the hillside turned to diamond drops as\nit reflected the flashes; \u201cthe fire ran along the\nground,\u201d thought Eames to himself. It was a sight\nto make a man forget his present occupations, if\nthose occupations had been less pressing and less\nsinister. Brinkman himself either did not carry a torch or\ndid not use it. His pace was leisurely on the whole,\nthough he seemed to quicken his step a little when\nthe church clock struck half-past eight. By that time\nhe was already at the opening of the gorge. This took\nhim out of sight, and Eames, secure in the cover\nwhich the dark tufts of fern afforded, ran forward\nover the spongy grass to creep up nearer to him.\nThe gorge itself, ominous at all times, was\nparticularly formidable under such skies as these. The\nhalf-light enabled one to see the path, but (to a man\nunaccustomed to his surroundings) suggested the\never-present possibility of losing one\u2019s foothold; and\nwhen the lightning came, it revealed the angry\ntorrent beneath with unpleasant vividness. Fortunately\nthe noise of the elements deadened the sound of feet\non the hard rock. Eames hesitated for one moment,\nand then followed along the narrow path that led up\nthe gorge. He could just see the dim figure that went before\nhim as it reached the wider foothold at the middle\nof the gorge, where Brinkman and Bredon had\ninterrupted their conversation to comment on the shape\nof the rocks, Then it halted, and Eames halted too;\nhe was now less than twenty yards behind, and he\nwas at the last turn in the rock which could promise\nhim any shelter from observation. He did well to\nhalt, for while he stood there a huge tree of lightning\nseemed to flash out from the opposite side of the\nvalley, and, for an interval which could be counted in\nseconds, the whole landscape lay open to view as if\nin hard daylight. Eames\u2019s eyes were riveted upon a single spot; he\nhad thoughts for nothing but the sudden and\ninexplicable behaviour of Brinkman. In that flash, he\nsaw the little man leaping up in the air, his right\nhand outstretched at full arm\u2019s length, as if to reach\nthe top, or something behind the top, of that very\nledge which in the morning he had compared to the\nrack in a railway carriage. Indeed, Brinkman himself\nlooked not unlike some juvenile traveller who just\ncannot reach the parcel he wants to bring down, and\nmust needs jump for it. What was the object of\nBrinkman\u2019s man\u0153uvre did not appear, nor even\nwhether he was trying to take something down from\nthe ledge or to put something onto it. But the\ngrotesque attitude, momentarily revealed in that single\nspotlight of the thunder-storm, was perfectly\nunmistakable. The prolonged glare left Eames momentarily\nblinded, like one who has just passed a car with very\npowerful headlights. When he saw clearly again, the\ndark figure under the ledge was gone. Could\nBrinkman have taken alarm? He had looked backward\nafter his absurd leap, like a man who felt he was\npursued. In any case, Eames must press forward\nnow, or he would lose his quarry altogether.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\nBy the time he had reached the ledge a new flash\ncame and showed him, at the very end of the gorge,\nBrinkman running as if for his life. There was no\nmore sense in concealment; he must mend his own\npace too; and that was impossible, on this narrow\nshelf of rock, unless he lit his torch. Lighting it, he\ntook one look at the ledge toward which Brinkman\nhad been jumping, and, by reason of his superior\nheight, saw without difficulty an envelope which\nlooked as if it must be the explanation of\nBrinkman\u2019s gesture. He reached it with little trouble, put\nit in his pocket, and ran. As he ran he heard the\nhum of a motor engine on the road above him. The scramble up the bank at the further end of\nthe gorge was less formidable than he had feared, for\nhe kept his torch alight, and he made a pace very\ncreditable for his years. But even as he breasted the\nlevel of the roadway, he saw a car climbing the hill,\ndoubtless carrying Brinkman with it. He cried to\nthe driver to stop, but a volley of thunder drowned\nhis utterance. He turned impotently, and began\nrunning down the hill: in ten minutes or so, at this pace,\nhe should be at the garage. But as he ran he took the\nenvelope out of his pocket and scanned its\nsuperscription by the light of his torch. It read: \u201cTo His\nLordship the Bishop of Pullford. Private and\nConfidential.\u201d He thrust it away, wondering; but a\nshort-winded man running has no taste for puzzles.\nWould it be any use turning in to the Load of\nMischief, and letting somebody else carry his message\nthe rest of the way? Hardly; and a double set of\nexplanations would be a waste of precious time. He reached the garage panting too heavily for\nspeech, and, in answer to a challenge in Leyland\u2019s\nvoice, turned his own torch on himself for\nidentification. Then, leaning wearily against the front of the\nlorry, he blurted out his explanations. \u201cHe\u2019s\ngone\u2014motor-car\u2014toward Pullford\u2014couldn\u2019t stop\nhim\u2014better follow him up\u2014didn\u2019t look a fast car\u2014lost\nhim at the gorge\u2014take me with you, and I\u2019ll\nexplain.\u201d \u201cYes, but curse it all, has he made for Pullford\nor for Lowgill? We must try Lowgill; we can\ntelegraph from there, anyhow, and have him stopped.\nHullo, who next?\u201d Angela had rushed in, hatless, to announce\nBreton\u2019s cryptic observation about the car. She\nknew his mysterious moods, and felt that it was\nbest to make straight for Leyland, especially as her\ncar was the only fast one in the township. \u201cRight you\nare,\u201d she said, when the situation had been\noutlined to her; \u201cI\u2019ll drive you both into Lowgill; jump\nup.\u201d \u201cMr. Pulteney,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cdo you mind\ngoing to the stables at the back of the inn to find\nmy man who\u2019s waiting there? Tell him what\u2019s\nhappened, say he\u2019s to get onto the telephone, break\ninto the post-office if necessary, and warn Pullford\nand Lowgill. He may just have time to head the man\noff. Oh, by the way, he won\u2019t know who you are,\nmay take you for Brinkman. Say, \u2018Here we are\nagain,\u2019 loudly\u2014do you mind?\u2014when you\u2019re outside\nthe stable.\u201d \u201cIt will be a novel experience,\u201d said Mr. Pulteney.",
        "It was nearly eleven o\u2019clock before Angela\nreturned; and, since she resolutely refused to\ndisclose anything about her movements unless\nBredon divulged his theory, there were no\nexplanations at all that night. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m inquisitive,\u201d\nshe explained, \u201cbut I do want to break you of that\nbad habit of obstinacy.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Bredon,\n\u201cif you choose to drag my name in the dust, not\nto mention my car, by these midnight expeditions,\nthere\u2019s no more to be said.\u201d And no more was said. They found Leyland already at breakfast when\nthey came down. He had been up, he said, since six,\nmaking inquiries in every conceivable direction. \u201cI\nmust say,\u201d he added, \u201cit wasn\u2019t Mrs. Bredon\u2019s fault\nwe didn\u2019t catch our man last night.\u201d \u201cThe woman was reckless, I suppose, as usual?\u201d\nasked Bredon. \u201cOo, no,\u201d said Angela in self-defence, \u201cI only got\nher going a little.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s eight miles to Lowgill by the signposts,\u201d\nsaid Leyland, \u201cand a little more in real life. Mrs.\nBredon did it\u2014and, remember, the gradients are far\nworse than those on the Pullford road\u2014in just over\ntwelve minutes. But we\u2019d no luck. The up-train from\nLowgill\u2014it\u2019s the only one of the big expresses that\nstops there\u2014had just gone before we arrived. And,\nof course, we couldn\u2019t tell whether Brinkman had\ngone on it or not. His car passed us on the road, only\na few hundred yards from the station, and we hadn\u2019t\ntime to stop.\u201d \u201cWhat car was he in?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the devilish part of it\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Mrs.\nBredon.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the damnable part of it,\u201d amended\nAngela serenely. \u201cIt was the car from the garage; and\nit sailed out at twenty-five minutes to nine, under\nMr. Leyland\u2019s nose. Even the sleuthlike brain of\nMr. Pulteney didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d explained Leyland, \u201cit was a very\nwell-arranged plant. Brinkman had rung up earlier\nin the afternoon, asking the garage to meet the late\ntrain which gets in to Chilthorpe at 8.40. He gave\nthe name of Merrick. The garage naturally asked\nno questions as to where the message came from;\nthey\u2019re always meeting that late train. And, of\ncourse, they assumed that there was somebody\narriving by that train. Then, when the man had got\na little way out of the town, just above the gorge\nthere, he was stopped on the road by a passenger\nwith a despatch-box in his hand, who was walking\nin the direction of Chilthorpe, as if coming from\nthe station. He waved at the car, and asked if it\nwas for Mr. Merrick; then he explained that he was\nin a great hurry, because he wanted to catch the\nexpress at Lowgill. It was a perfectly normal thing\nto want to do, and there wasn\u2019t much time to do it\nin; so the man went all out, and just caught the\nexpress in time. He didn\u2019t know who we were when\nwe passed him, and it wasn\u2019t till he got back to\nChilthorpe that he realized what he\u2019d done.\nMeanwhile, who\u2019s to say whether Brinkman stopped at\nLowgill, or really got into the express?\u201d \u201cOr took the later train back to Pullford?\u201d\nsuggested Bredon. \u201cNo, we kept a good lookout to see that he didn\u2019t\ndo that. But the other uncertainty remained, and it\nwas fatal to my plans. I sent word to London to\nhave the train watched when it got in, giving a\ndescription of Brinkman; but of course that\u2019s never\nany use. In half an hour or so I shall get a telegram\nfrom London to say they\u2019ve found nothing.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have the express stopped down the\nline?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have liked to, of course. But it\u2019s a mail train,\nand it\u2019s always full of rich people in first-class\ncarriages. Give me a local train on a Saturday night,\nand I\u2019ll have it stopped and searched and all the\npassengers held up for two hours, and not so much\nas a letter to the papers about it. But if you stop\none of these big expresses on the chance of\nheading off a criminal, and nothing comes of it, there\u2019ll\nbe questions asked in the House of Commons. And I\nwas in a bad position, you see. I can\u2019t prove that\nBrinkman was a murderer. Not at present, anyhow.\nIf he\u2019d run off in Mottram\u2019s car, I could have\narrested him for car-stealing, but he hadn\u2019t. Why, he\neven paid Mrs. Davis\u2019s bill!\u201d \u201cDo you mean to say he asked for his bill\nyesterday afternoon, and we never heard of it?\u201d \u201cNo, he calculated it out exactly, left a tip of\ntwo shillings for the barmaid, and went off leaving\nthe money on his chest of drawers.\u201d \u201cWhat about his suitcase?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his, it was Mottram\u2019s. He carried off\nall his own things in the despatch-box. Apart from\nthe fact that he gave a false name to the garage\npeople, his exit was quite en r\u00e8gle. And it\u2019s\ndangerous to stop a train and arrest a man like that. Added\nto which, it was perfectly possible that he was lying\ndoggo at Lowgill.\u201d It was at this point that Mr. Pulteney sailed into\nthe room. The old gentleman was rubbing his hands\nbriskly in the enjoyment of retrospect; he had\nscarce any need of breakfast, you would have said,\nso richly was he chewing the cud of his experiences\novernight. \u201cWhat a day I have spent!\u201d he\nexclaimed. \u201cI have examined a motor-car, and even\nopened part of its mechanism, without asking the\nowner\u2019s leave. I have been suspected of murder. I\nhave set up in an extremely draughty garage,\nwaiting to pounce upon a criminal. And, to crown it all,\nI have approached a total stranger with the words\n\u2018Here we are again.\u2019 Really life has nothing more\nto offer me. But where is Mr. Eames?\u201d \u201cWe took him to Lowgill with us,\u201d explained\nAngela, \u201cand when he got there he insisted on taking\nthe late train back to Pullford. He said he had\nsomething to talk over with the Bishop. He has left some\npyjamas and a toothbrush here as hostages, and\nsays he will look in on us in the course of the day\nto reclaim them. So you\u2019ll see him again.\u201d \u201cA remarkable man. A shrewd judge of\ncharacter. He recognized me at once as a man of\nreflection. God bless my soul! Do I understand that\nMrs. Davis has provided us with sausages?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Angela. \u201cShe must\nhave felt that the occasion had to be marked out\nsomehow. And she was so pleased at having her bill\npaid. I don\u2019t think Brinky can have been such an\nunpleasant man, after all.\u201d \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Leyland earnestly, \u201cthere is\nno greater mistake than to suppose your criminal\nis a man lost to all human feelings. It is perfectly\npossible for Brinkman to have murdered his master,\nand have been prepared to run off with a car and a\nthousand pounds which didn\u2019t belong to him, and\nyet to have shrunk from the prospect of leaving an\nhonest woman like Mrs. Davis the poorer for his\nvisit. We are men, you see, and we are not made\nall in one piece.\u201d \u201cBut how odd of him to pop off into the gorge\nlike that! I mean, it\u2019s a very jolly place, they tell\nme; and we know Brinky admired the scenery of\nit, because he told my husband so. But isn\u2019t\nit rather odd of him to have wanted to take a long,\nlast lingering look at it before he bolted for South\nAmerica?\u201d \u201cIt is perfectly possible that it may have had a\nfascination for him,\u201d assented Leyland. \u201cBut I think\nhis conduct was more reasonable than you suppose.\nAfter all, by coming up at the farther end of the\ngorge he managed to make it look quite natural when\nthe motor found him walking in the direction of\nChilthorpe. And, more than that, I have little doubt\nthat he knew he was followed. Eames is a most\ncapable fellow, but he must, I think, have followed\nhis man a little carelessly, and so given himself\naway. Brinkman probably thought that it was\nBredon who was following him.\u201d \u201cBecause he did it so badly, you mean?\u201d\nsuggested Angela. \u201cMiles, you shouldn\u2019t throw bread\nat breakfast, it\u2019s rude.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I meant that he had reason\nto believe Mr. Eames was at the cinema, whereas\nhe knew Bredon was in the house, and saw him\nsitting in a window that looks down over the street.\nAlmost inevitably he must have supposed that it\nwas the watcher in the front of the house who had\nfollowed in his tracks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worse than that,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\nyou see, when my wife went out of the room, she\nopened the door in that careless way she has, and\nthree of my cards fell into the street below. Well,\nI thought Brinkman had disappeared; there was no\nsign of him. So I went downstairs and retrieved\nthe cards, thinking it couldn\u2019t do any harm. But I\u2019ve\nbeen wondering since whether Brinkman wasn\u2019t still\nwatching, and whether my disappearance from the\nwindow didn\u2019t give him the first hint that he was\nbeing followed. I\u2019m awfully sorry.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t expect it made any difference. He\nwas a cool hand, you see. I suppose he thought your\nsitting in the window must be a trap, and that the\nhouse was really watched at the back. He wasn\u2019t\nfar wrong there, of course.\u201d \u201cIndeed he was not,\u201d assented Mr. Pulteney.\n\u201cYou seem to me to have posted a singularly\nlynx-eyed gentleman in the stables.\u201d \u201cAnd so, you see, he thought he\u2019d brazen it out.\nHe reckoned on being followed, but that didn\u2019t\nmatter to him as long as the man behind was a good\ndistance off, and as long as he himself made sure\nof picking up his car at the right moment. The whole\nthing was monstrously mismanaged on my part. But,\nyou see, I made absolutely certain that he was going\nfor Mottram\u2019s car, in which he\u2019d obviously made all\nthe necessary preparations. Even now I can\u2019t\nunderstand how he consented so calmly to leave the car\nbehind him. Unless, of course, he spotted that we\nwere watching the garage, and knew that it would\nbe unsafe. But he must be crippled for money\nwithout his thousand.\u201d \u201cMy husband,\u201d said Angela mischievously,\n\u201cseemed to know beforehand that he wouldn\u2019t go\noff in Mottram\u2019s car.\u201d \u201cYes, by the way,\u201d asked Leyland, \u201chow was\nthat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it ought to have occurred to me earlier.\nIt never dawned on me till the moment when I\nmentioned it, and of course then it was too late. But it\nwas merely the result of a reasoning process which\nhad been going on in my own mind. I had been\ntrying to work things out, and it seemed to me that\nI had arrived at an explanation which would cover\nall the facts. And that explanation, though it didn\u2019t\nexclude the possibility that Brinkman intended to\nskip with the thousand and the car, didn\u2019t make it\nabsolutely necessary that he should mean to.\u201d \u201cI suppose you\u2019re still hankering after suicide?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say so.\u201d \u201cBut, hang it all, though there\u2019s little enough that\u2019s\nclear, it\u2019s surely clear by now that Brinkman was a\nwrong \u2019un. And if he was a wrong \u2019un, what can his\nmotive have been throughout unless he was\nMottram\u2019s murderer? I don\u2019t associate innocence with a\nsudden flitting at nightfall, and a bogus name given\nin when you order the car to take you to the\nstation.\u201d \u201cStill, it\u2019s not enough to have a general impression\nthat a man is a wrong \u2019un, and hang him on the\nstrength of it. You must discover a motive for which\nhe would have done the murder, and a method by\nwhich he could have done it. Are you prepared to\nproduce those?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d said Leyland. \u201cI don\u2019t profess to have\nall the details of the case at my fingers\u2019 ends; but\nI\u2019m prepared to give what seems to me a rational\nexplanation of all the circumstances. And it\u2019s an\nexplanation which contends that Mottram met his\ndeath by murder.\u201d",
        "\u201cOf course, as to the motive,\u201d went on\nLeyland, \u201cI am not absolutely sure that I can\npoint to a single one. But a combination\nof motives is sufficient, if the motives are\ncomparatively strong ones. On the whole, I am inclined to put\nthe thousand pounds first. For a rich man, Mottram\ndid not pay his secretary very well; and at times, I\nunderstand, he talked of parting with him.\nBrinkman knew that the sum was in Mottram\u2019s\npossession, for it was he himself who cashed the cheque\nat the bank. It was only a day or two before they\ncame down here. On the other hand, I doubt if\nBrinkman knew where the money was; plainly\nMottram didn\u2019t trust him very much, or he wouldn\u2019t\nhave taken the trouble to sew the money in the\ncushions of the car. When I first found the cache, I\nassumed that Brinkman knew of its existence, and\nthat was one of the reasons why I felt so certain that\nhe would make straight for the garage. Now, I\u2019m\nmore inclined to think he fancied he would find the\nmoney among Mottram\u2019s effects, which he must have\nhoped to examine in the interval before the arrival\nof the police.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t think the Euthanasia had\nanything to do with it after all?\u201d asked Bredon. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. There\u2019s no doubt that\nBrinkman was a rabid anti-clerical\u2014Eames was talking to\nme about that\u2014and I think it\u2019s quite likely he would\nhave welcomed, in any case, an opportunity of\ngetting Mottram out of the way provided that the death\nlooked like suicide. The appearance of suicide would\nhave the advantage, as we have all seen, that the\nIndescribable wouldn\u2019t pay up. But he wanted, in\nany case, to give the murder the appearance of\nsuicide, in order to save his own skin.\u201d \u201cThen you think both motives were present to his\nmind?\u201d \u201cProbably. I suppose there is little doubt that he\nknew of the danger to Mottram\u2019s health, and the\nconsequent danger, from his point of view, that the\nmoney would go to the Pullford Diocese. But I don\u2019t\nthink that motive would have been sufficient, if he\nhadn\u2019t reckoned on getting away with a thousand\npounds which didn\u2019t belong to him.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s pass the motive,\u201d said Bredon. \u201cI\u2019m\ninterested to hear your account of the method.\u201d \u201cOur mistake from the first has been that of not\naccepting the facts. We have tried to fit the facts into\nour scheme, instead of letting the facts themselves\nguide us. From the first we were faced with what\nseemed to be a hopeless contradiction. The locked\ndoor seemed to make it certain that Mottram was\nalone when he died. The fact that the gas was turned\noff seemed to make it clear that Mottram was not\nalone when he died. There was ground for suspecting\neither suicide or murder; the difficulty was to make\nthe whole complex of facts fit into either view. We\nhad made a mistake, I repeat, in not taking the facts\nfor our guide. The door was locked; that is a fact.\nTherefore Mottram was alone from the time he\nwent to bed until the time when the door was broken\nin. And at the time when the door was broken in\nthe gas was found turned off. Somebody must have\nturned it off, and in order to do so he must have\nbeen in the room. There was only one person in the\nroom\u2014Mottram. Therefore it was Mottram who\nturned the gas off.\u201d \u201cYou mean in his last dying moments?\u201d \u201cNo, such a theory would be fantastic. Mottram\nclearly turned the gas off in the ordinary way.\nTherefore, now, mark this, it was not the gas in\nMottram\u2019s room which poisoned Mottram.\u201d \u201cBut hang it all, if it wasn\u2019t in his room\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cWhen I say that, I mean it was not the gas\nwhich turned on and off in Mottram\u2019s room. For\nthat gas was turned off. Therefore it must have been\nsome independent supply of gas which poisoned\nhim.\u201d \u201cSuch as?\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t the solution occur to you yet? The room,\nremember, is very low, and the window rather high\nup in the wall. What is to prevent a supply of gas\nbeing introduced from outside and from above?\u201d \u201cGood Lord! You don\u2019t mean you think that\nBrinkman\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cBrinkman had the room immediately above.\nSince his hurried departure, I have had opportunities\nof taking a better look round it. I was making some\nexperiments there early this morning. In the first\nplace, I find that it is possible for a man leaning\nout of the window in Brinkman\u2019s room to control\nwith a stick the position of the window in Mottram\u2019s\nroom\u2014provided always that the window is swinging\nloose. He can ensure at will that Mottram\u2019s window\nstands almost shut, or almost fully open.\u201d \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s true.\u201d \u201cI find, further, that Brinkman\u2019s room, like\nMottram\u2019s, was supplied with a double apparatus, with\na bracket on the wall and with a movable standard\nlamp. But whereas the main tap in Mottram\u2019s room\nwas near the door, and the tube which connected the\ngas with the standard lamp was meant to allow the\nlamp to be put on the writing-table, in Brinkman\u2019s\nroom it was the other way. The main tap was near\nthe window, and the tube which connected it with\nthe standard lamp was meant to allow the lamp to\nbe placed at the bedside. The main tap in\nBrinkman\u2019s room is barely a yard from the window. And\nthe tube of the standard lamp is some four yards\nlong. \u201cWhen Mottram went to bed, Brinkman went up\nto his room. He knew that Mottram had taken a\nsleeping draught; that in half an hour or so he would\nbe asleep, and unconscious of all that went on. So,\nleaving a prudent interval of time, Brinkman\nproceeded as follows. He took the tube off from the\nfoot of the standard lamp; that is quite an easy\nmatter. Then he took the tube to the window.\nWith a walking-stick he slightly opened Mottram\u2019s\nwindow down below\u2014it had been left ajar. And\nthrough the opening thus made he let down the tube\ntill the end of it was in Mottram\u2019s room. Then, with\nthe walking-stick, he shut the window again,\nexcept for a mere crack which was needed to let\nthe tube through. Then he turned on the guide-tap\nwhich fed his standard lamp, and the gas began to\nflow through into Mottram\u2019s room. That coil of\ntube was a venomous serpent, which could poison\nMottram in his sleep, behind locked doors, and\nbe removed again without leaving any trace when\nits deadly work was done. \u201cWhether it was through carelessness on\nBrinkman\u2019s part, or whether it was owing to the wind,\nthat the window swung right open and became fixed\nthere, I don\u2019t know. In any case, it did not make\nmuch difference to his plans. He had now succeeded\nin bringing off the murder, and in a way which\nit would have been hard for anybody to suspect.\nBut there was one more difficulty to be got over: In\norder to remove the suspicion of murder, and to\nmake the suspicion of suicide inevitable, it was\nnecessary to turn on the gas in Mottram\u2019s room. Now,\nthere was no implement Brinkman could employ\nwhich would enable him to reach Mottram\u2019s gas-tap.\nHe depended, therefore, on bluff. He made sure that\nhe would be summoned by the Boots when the\nlocked door forbade entrance. He would force his\nway in with the Boots; he would make straight\nfor the tap, and pretend to turn it off. Would\nanybody doubt that it was he who had turned it off?\nThe room was full of gas fumes, and even a man of\nmore intelligence than the Boots would naturally\nleap to the conclusion that the gas must have been\non, in order to account for the fumes. \u201cHis plan, you see, was perfect in its preparations.\nIt was an unexpected interference that prevented\nits coming off. When Brinkman was telling you\nthe story, he pretended that it was he who saw Dr.\nFerrers outside, and suggested calling him in.\nActually it was the Boots, according to the story he\nhimself tells, who drew attention to the presence of Dr.\nFerrers and suggested his being called in. This point,\nwhich was of capital importance, was slurred over at\nthe inquest because nobody saw the bearing of it.\nBrinkman did not want Dr. Ferrers to be there; yet\nthe suggestion was too reasonable to be turned down.\nBrinkman stationed himself with his shoulder close\nto the lock, while Ferrers leant his weight against\nthe door at the other end, nearest the hinges.\nAssuming that the lock would give, Brinkman could\nrush into the room first and go through the motions\nof turning off the gas without attracting suspicion. \u201cActually, it was the hinges which gave. Dr. Ferrers,\nrealizing that the gas must be turned off in order\nto clear the air, ran straight to the tap over the d\u00e9bris\nof the broken door before Brinkman could get\nat it. And Ferrers naturally exclaimed in surprise\nwhen he found the tap already turned off. The Boots\nheard his exclamation; Brinkman\u2019s plan had fallen\nthrough. There was nothing for it but to pretend that\nthe tap was a loose one, and that Dr. Ferrers had\nhimself turned it off without noticing it. That was\nthe story, Bredon, which he put up to you. We know\nthat it was a lie.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite see,\u201d said Bredon, \u201chow all this\nworks in with the sandwiches and whisky. In the\nmotor, I mean. What was the idea of them?\u201d \u201cWell, Brinkman\u2019s original idea must clearly have\nbeen flight. That was, I take it, when he realized the\ndifficulty which had been created for him by his\nfailure to reach the gas first. It must have been\nbefore I arrived that he made these preparations\u2014stored\nthe motor with food and painted out the\nnumber-plate at the back. I\u2019ve had him under pretty\ncareful observation ever since I came here. But that\nwas Tuesday afternoon, and I have no doubt that\nhis preparations had been made by then.\u201d \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t he skip?\u201d \u201cI think he was worried by my arrival. You see,\nhe tried to palm off the suicide story on me, and I\ndidn\u2019t fall to it. If he skipped, he would confirm\nme in my conviction that there had been a murder,\nand, although he himself might get off scotfree, it\nwould mean that your Indescribable people would\nhave to pay up to the Bishop of Pullford. He couldn\u2019t\nstand the idea of that. He preferred to hang about\nhere, trying to convince you, because you were\nalready half-convinced, that the case was one of\nsuicide and that the company was not liable.\u201d \u201cIn fact, he just waited for the funeral, and then\nmade off?\u201d \u201cNo, he waited until he thought he wasn\u2019t watched.\nIt\u2019s a rum business, shadowing a man; you don\u2019t\nwant him to see exactly who is shadowing him, or\nwhere the man is who is shadowing him; but you\ndo, very often, want him to know that he is\nshadowed, because that makes him lose his head and give\nhimself away. Now, Brinkman didn\u2019t know what I\nsuspected and didn\u2019t, I think, know about my two\nmen at the Swan. But I contrived to let him see that\nhe was under observation, and that it wasn\u2019t safe\nfor him to go far out of my sight. It\u2019s an old game:\nyou give a man that impression, and then you\nsuddenly let on that he is free\u2014for the moment at any\nrate. He seizes his chance, and, with luck, you catch\nhim. He really thought yesterday evening that you\nwere the only person watching the front of the house.\nBut he was clever enough, confound him, to see that\nthere might be danger for him in the garage. So he\nrang up, ordering a car to meet the 8.40 at\nChilthorpe Station, and then made his\narrangements\u2014uncommonly good ones\u2014for boarding the car en\nroute. And nobody\u2019s to blame, exactly, but I gravely\nfear that the murderer has got off scotfree.\u201d As if in confirmation of his words, the maid\ncame in with a telegram. He opened it and crushed\nit in his hand. \u201cAs I thought,\u201d he said; \u201cthey\nsearched the train at the terminus and didn\u2019t find\ntheir man. They may watch the ports, but I doubt\nif they\u2019ll get him now. It\u2019s a rotten business.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve explained everything,\u201d said\nBredon, \u201cI mean, about Brinkman\u2019s movements\nafter the murder. Indeed, I know for a fact that\nyou haven\u2019t explained everything; partly because\nyou don\u2019t know everything. But I think your account\nof Brinkman\u2019s movements that night is\nextraordinarily ingenious, and I only wish it were true. I\nwish it were true, I mean, because it would have\nbrought us up, for once in our lives, against a really\nclever criminal. But, you see, there\u2019s one thing which\nis fatal to all your theory. You haven\u2019t explained\nwhy the gas-tap showed the mark where Mottram\nturned it on and didn\u2019t show the mark where\nMottram turned it off.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I admit that\u2019s puzzling. Still, one can\nimagine circumstances\u201d\u2014\u2014 \u201cOne can imagine circumstances, but one can\u2019t fit\nthem onto the facts. If the gas had been quite close\nto Mottram\u2019s bed, and he had had a stick by his side,\nhe might have turned off the tap with the stick; I\u2019ve\nknown slack men do that. But the gas wasn\u2019t near\nenough for that. Or, again, if Mottram had gone to\nbed in gloves, he might have turned off the tap\nwith gloves on; but he didn\u2019t. The tap was stiff;\nit was stiff both when you turned it on and when\nyou turned it off; and there must, in reason, have\nbeen some slight trace left if that gas was turned\noff by a man\u2019s naked fingers. Therefore it wasn\u2019t\nturned off by a man\u2019s naked fingers. Therefore it\nwasn\u2019t turned off by Mottram, or by anybody who\nhad any business to turn it off. It was turned off by\nsomebody who had a secret end to serve in doing so.\u201d \u201cYou mean a criminal end?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said a secret end. Your\nview doesn\u2019t explain that; and because it doesn\u2019t\nexplain that, although I think you\u2019ve told us an\nextraordinarily ingenious story, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nworth forty pounds.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Hullo! What\u2019s this\narriving?\u201d The taxi from the garage had drawn up outside\nthe inn\u2019s door, and was depositing some passengers\nwho had obviously come by the early morning train\nfrom Pullford. They were not left in doubt for long;\nthe coffee-room door was opened, and, with \u201cDon\u2019t\nget up, please\u201d written all over his apologetic\nfeatures, the Bishop of Pullford walked in. Eames\nfollowed behind him. \u201cGood-morning, Mr. Bredon. I\u2019m so sorry to\ndisturb you and your friends at breakfast like this.\nBut Mr. Eames here has been telling me about your\nalarums and excursions last night, and I thought\nprobably there would be some tired brains this\nmorning. Also, I felt it was important to tell you all I\nknow, because of Mr. Brinkman\u2019s hurried\ndeparture.\u201d Bredon hastily effected the necessary\nintroductions. \u201cYou know something, then, after all?\u201d \u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t think I\u2019ve been playing you\nfalse, Mr. Bredon. The evidence I\u2019m referring to\nonly came to hand last night. But such as it is, it\u2019s\ndecisive; it proves that poor Mottram met his death\nby suicide.\u201d",
        "\u201cRapid adjustment of the mental\nperspective,\u201d said Mr. Pulteney, \u201cis an invaluable\nexercise, especially at my age. But I\nconfess there is a point at which the process becomes\nconfusing. Are we now to understand that Mr.\nBrinkman, so far from being a murderer, is simply an\ninnocent man with a taste for motoring late at night?\nI have no doubt there is a satisfactory explanation\nof it all, but it looks to me as if there had been\nan absence of straightforwardness on somebody\u2019s\npart.\u201d \u201cPossibly on that of Mr. Eames,\u201d said the Bishop.\n\u201cI have to confess, on his behalf, that he has been\nconcealing something, and to take the blame for his\nconduct\u2014if blame attaches to it\u2014unreservedly upon\nmyself. However, I do not think that any earlier\ndisclosure could have helped forward the cause of\njustice; and I have lost no time in putting it all\nbefore you.\u201d \u201cYou mean that letter which was left about in\nthe gorge,\u201d suggested Bredon, \u201caddressed to the\nBishop of Pullford? With a confession of suicide\nin it?\u201d \u201cGoodness, Mr. Bredon, you seem to know as\nmuch about it as I do myself! Well, that is the long\nand short of it. When Mr. Eames was with you last\nnight, Mr. Leyland, he told you that he had followed\nBrinkman along the gorge, and that Brinkman had\ndisappeared in a motor. He did not tell you that,\nhalf way through the gorge, he saw Brinkman\nleaping up under a ledge in the rock, as if to put\nsomething on it or take something down from it. The\nsomething which he was putting up or taking down\nwas, I make no doubt, the document which I now\nhold in my hand. Mr. Eames found it after Brinkman\nhad left, and, seeing that it was addressed to me\nwith an intimation that it was private and\nconfidential, thought it best to carry it straight to me\nwithout informing you of its existence. I\nunderstood him to say that he did not mention its\nexistence to you, Mr. Bredon, either.\u201d \u201cNor did I,\u201d put in Eames. \u201cHow jolly of you, Mr. Eames,\u201d said Angela.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think what a lot of trouble we\u2019ve been\nhaving with my husband; he thinks he knows all\nabout the mystery, and he won\u2019t tell us; isn\u2019t it\nodious of him? And I\u2019m so glad to think that you\nmanaged to keep him in the dark about something.\u201d \u201cNot entirely,\u201d protested Bredon. \u201cCast your eye\nover that, Mr. Eames.\u201d And a document was handed,\nfirst to Eames, then to the rest of the company,\nwhich certainly seemed to make Eames\u2019s caution\nunnecessary. It was a plain scrap of paper, scrawled\nover in pencil with the handwriting of a man who is\ntravelling at thirty-five miles an hour over bumpy\nroads in a badly sprung car. All it said was, \u201cMake\nEames shew you what he found in the gorge. I\nthought it was you. F. Brinkman.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the Bishop. \u201cBrinkman, it seemed,\nhad some doubt as to the fate of a document which\ngot into the hands of the Catholic authorities. Poor\nfellow, he was always rather bitter about it.\nHowever, here we are, Mr. Bredon, owning up like good\nboys. It was to put that very document into your\nhands that I came down this morning. But I think\nMr. Eames was quite right in holding that the\ndocument, with such a superscription, ought to be\nhanded over to me direct, without any mention even\nof its existence to a third party.\u201d \u201cI for one,\u201d put in Leyland, \u201capplaud his action.\nI do not believe in all these posthumous revelations;\nI prefer to respect the confidence of the dead. But I\nunderstand that Your Lordship is prepared to let\nus see the contents of the letter after all?\u201d \u201cCertainly. I think poor Mottram\u2019s last directions\nwere influenced simply by consideration for my own\nfeelings in the matter. I have no hesitation myself\nin making it public. Shall I read it here and now?\u201d In deference to a chorus of assent, the Bishop\ntook out the enclosure of the envelope and prepared\nto read. \u201cI ought to say by way of preface,\u201d he\nexplained, \u201cthat I knew poor Mottram\u2019s handwriting\nwell enough, and I feel fully convinced that this is\na genuine autograph of his, not a forgery. You will\nsee why I mention that later on. This is how the\nletter runs: \u201c\u200a\u2018My dear Lord Bishop: \u201c\u200a\u2018Pursuant to our conversation of Thursday\n  evening last, it will be within your Lordship\u2019s memory\n  that upon that occasion I asserted the right of a man,\n  in given circumstances, to take his own life,\n  particularly when same was threatened by an incurable\n  and painful disease. This I only mentioned casually,\n  when illustrating the argument I was then trying to\n  put forward, namely that the end justifies the means,\n  even in a case where said means are bad, provided\n  said ends are good. I note that your Lordship is of\n  the contrary opinion, namely that said end does not\n  justify said means. I am, however, confident that in\n  a concrete case like the present your Lordship will\n  be more open to conviction re this matter, as it is a\n  case where I am acting to the best of my lights,\n  which, your Lordship has often told me, is all that\n  a man can do when in doubtful circumstances. \u201c\u200a\u2018I regret to have to inform your Lordship that,\n  interviewing recently a specialist in London re my\n  health, said specialist informed me that I was\n  suffering from an incurable disease. I have not the skill\n  to write the name of it; and as it is of an unusual\n  nature, maybe it would not interest your Lordship to\n  know it. The specialist was, however, of the decided\n  opinion that I could not survive more than two years\n  or thereabouts; and that in the interim the disease\n  would give rise to considerable pain. It is therefore\n  my intention, in pursuance of the line of argument\n  which I have already done my best to explain to your\n  Lordship, to take my own life, in circumstances\n  which will be sufficiently public by the time this\n  reaches you. \u201c\u200a\u2018I have not, as your Lordship knows, any firm\n  religious convictions. I believe that there is a future\n  life of some kind, and that we shall all be judged\n  according to our opportunities and the use we made\n  of same. I believe that God is merciful, and will\n  make allowances for the difficulties we had in\n  knowing what was the right thing to do and in doing it.\n  But I have been through some hard times, and maybe\n  not always acted for the best. Being desirous,\n  therefore, of making my peace with God, I have taken the\n  liberty of devising some of the property of which I\n  die possessed to your Lordship personally, to be used\n  for the benefit of the diocese of Pullford. Said\n  property consisting of the benefits accruing from the\n  Euthanasia policy taken out by me with the\n  Indescribable Insurance Company. And so have directed\n  my lawyers in a will made by me recently. \u201c\u200a\u2018I believe that your Lordship is a man of God,\n  and anxious to do his best for his fellow-citizens in\n  the town of Pullford. I believe that the money will\n  serve a good end, although I do not agree with what\n  your Lordship teaches. I feel sure that your Lordship\n  will realize the desirability of keeping this letter\n  private, and not letting it be known that I took my\n  own life. The insurance company would probably\n  refuse to pay the claim if I was supposed to have died\n  by my own hand, that being their rule in such cases,\n  except where the deceased was of unsound mind,\n  which is not the case, me being in full possession of\n  all my faculties. If, however, the preparations which\n  I have made should eventuate successfully, it will not\n  be supposed by the coroner\u2019s jury that I took my own\n  life, and the claim will be paid accordingly. Your\n  Lordship will realize that this is only fair, since\n  (1) in taking my own life I am only anticipating the\n  decree of nature by a few months, and (2) the object\n  to which I have devised the money is not the selfish\n  enjoyment of a few persons, but the spiritual\n  benefit of a large number, mostly poor. I am writing this,\n  therefore, for your Lordship\u2019s own eyes, and it has\n  no need to be made public. I am quite sure that\n  God will forgive me what I am doing if it is at all\n  wrong, for I am afraid to suffer pain and am doing\n  my best to bequeath my money in such a way that\n  same will be used for good purposes. With every\n  gratitude for the kindness I have always received at\n  the Cathedral House, though not of the same\n  religion, I remain, \u201c\u200a\u2018Your Lordship\u2019s obedient servant, \u201c\u200a\u2018J. Mottram.\u2019\u200a\u201d The Bishop\u2019s voice quavered a little at certain\npoints in this recital; it was difficult not to be\naffected by the laborious efforts of a pen untrained\nin language to do justice to the writer\u2019s friendly\nintentions. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry indeed for the poor\nfellow,\u201d the Bishop said. \u201cThe older we grow, the more\ntender we must become toward the strange vagaries\nof the human conscience. That\u2019s not the letter of a\nman, whose mind is unhinged. And yet, what is one\nto make of a conscience so strangely misformed?\nHowever, I didn\u2019t come here to talk about all that.\nYou\u2019ll see for yourselves that, although the writer\nrecommends my keeping it dark, he places me under\nno obligation to do so\u2014he would have put me in an\nuncommonly awkward position if he had. As it is,\nI\u2019ve had no hesitation in reading it to you, and shall\nhave no hesitation in producing it, if necessary,\nbefore a court of law. It seems that our legacy, after\nall, was only a castle in Spain.\u201d \u201cThe poor dear!\u201d said Angela. \u201cAnd it\u2019s bad luck\non you, Mr. Leyland. Did you realize, My Lord,\nthat Mr. Leyland had just succeeded in persuading\nus all that Mr. Brinkman had murdered Mr.\nMottram by letting in gas from the room above?\u201d \u201cWell, thank God it was nothing as bad as that!\u201d\nsaid the Bishop. \u201cAt least this letter will help us\nto take a kindlier view of him.\u201d \u201cIt would be a very singular and, I had almost\nsaid, a diverting circumstance, if both things could\nhave happened at once,\u201d said Mr. Pulteney, \u201cif,\nwhile Mottram was busy poisoning himself with his\nown gas down below, Brinkman was at the same\nmoment, in complete ignorance, feeding him with an\nextra supply of gas from above. It would be a\nsomewhat knotty problem, in that case, to decide whether\nwe were to call it suicide or murder. However,\u201d\nhe added with a little bow to the Bishop, \u201cwe have\na competent authority with us.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t ask me, sir,\u201d protested the Bishop, \u201cI\nshould have to consult my Canon Penitentiary. He\nwould tell me, I fancy, that the act of murder in this\ncase inflowed into the act of suicide, but I am not\nsure that would help us much.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d suggested Eames, \u201cMr. Bredon could\ntell us what view the Indescribable would take of\nsuch a case.\u201d \u201cThey would be hard put to it,\u201d said Bredon.\n\u201cFortunately, there is no question of any such doubt\nhere. For Leyland\u2019s suggestion of murder was only\nbased on the impossibility of suicide, in view of the\ngas being turned off. Whereas Mr. Pulteney\u2019s\ningenious suggestion has all the difficulties in it which\nLeyland was trying to avoid.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hanged if I can make head or tail of it,\u201d\nsaid Leyland. \u201cIt\u2019s like a nightmare, this case;\nevery time you think you\u2019ve found some solid ground\nto rest on, it sinks under your feet. I shall begin to\nbelieve in ghosts soon. And what are we to make\nof the message itself? Might I see the envelope, My\nLord?\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Thank you. Well, it\u2019s clear that\nBrinkman wasn\u2019t putting the letter up on the ledge; he\nwas taking it down. It\u2019s so weather-stained that it\nmust clearly have been there the best part of a week.\nNow, why on earth was Brinkman so anxious to\ntake the letter away with him? For the letter proved\nit was suicide, and that\u2019s precisely what he wanted\nto have proved.\u201d \u201cBrinkman may not have known what was in the\nletter,\u201d suggested Eames. \u201cHe may have thought the thousand pounds were\nin it,\u201d suggested Pulteney, \u201cwaiting there as a\nsurprise present for the Bishop. I am no acrobat\nmyself, but I believe I could jump pretty high if you\ngave me that sum to aspire to.\u201d \u201cI wonder if Brinkman did know?\u201d said\nLeyland. \u201cOf course if he did he was an accessory before\nthe fact to Mottram\u2019s suicide. And that might make\nhim anxious for his own position\u2014but it doesn\u2019t\nring true, that idea.\u201d \u201cMight I see the letter itself?\u201d asked Bredon. \u201cIt\nsounds impolite, I know; but I only want to look at\nthe way in which it\u2019s written.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Thank you, My\nLord.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It\u2019s rather a suggestive fact, isn\u2019t it, that\nthis letter was copied?\u201d \u201cCopied?\u201d asked the Bishop. \u201cHow on earth can\nyou tell that?\u201d \u201cI am comparing it in my mind\u2019s eye with the\nletter we found lying about in Mottram\u2019s bedroom,\nhalf-finished. Mottram wrote with difficulty; his\nthoughts didn\u2019t flow to his pen. Consequently, in that\nletter to the Pullford Examiner you will find that\nonly the last sentence at the bottom of the page has\nbeen blotted when the ink was wet. The rest of the\npage had had time to dry naturally, while Mottram\nwas thinking of what to say next. But this letter of\nyours, My Lord, has been written straight off, and\nthe blotting process becomes more and more marked\nthe further you get down the page. I say, therefore,\nthat Mottram had already composed the letter in\nrough, and when he set down to this sheet of paper\nhe was copying it straight down.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not suggesting that Brinkman dictated\nthe letter?\u201d asked Leyland. \u201cOf course that would\nopen up some interesting possibilities.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t thinking of that. I was only\nthinking it was rather a cold-blooded way for a suicide\nto write his last letter. But it\u2019s a small point.\u201d \u201cAnd meanwhile,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cI suppose\nyou\u2019re waiting for me to fork out those forty\npounds?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said the Bishop, \u201cyou have a personal\ninterest in this, Mr. Bredon? Well, in any case you\nhave saved your company a larger sum than that.\nI\u2019m afraid you will have to write and tell them that\nit was suicide, and the claim does not urge.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, My Lord,\u201d said Bredon,\nknocking out his pipe thoughtfully into the fireplace, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to write to the company and tell them that\nthe claim has got to be paid, because Mottram met\nhis death by accident.\u201d",
        "\u201cGod bless my soul!\u201d cried the Bishop, \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t mean to say you\u2019re preparing to\nhush it up! Why, your moral theology\nmust be as bad as poor Mottram\u2019s.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t a question of theology,\u201d replied Bredon,\n\u201cit\u2019s a question of fact. I am going to write to the\nIndescribable Company and tell them that Mottram\ndied by accident, because that happens to be the\ntruth.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014h-h!\u201d said Angela. \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Mr. Eames. \u201cNot another mental perspective!\u201d groaned Mr.\nPulteney. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it is. I\u2019m not a detective\nreally; I can\u2019t sit down and think things out. I see\neverything just as other people do, I share all their\nbewilderment. But suddenly, when I\u2019m thinking of\nsomething quite different, a game of patience, for\nexample, I see the whole thing in a new mental\nperspective. It\u2019s like the optical illusion of the tumbling\ncubes\u2014you know, the pattern of cubes which looks\nconcave to the eye, and then, by a readjustment of\nyour mental focus, you suddenly see them as convex\ninstead. What produces that change? Why, you catch\nsight of one particular angle in a new light, and\nfrom that you get your new mental picture of the\nwhole pattern. Just so, one can stumble upon a new\nmental perspective about a problem like this by\nsuddenly seeing one single fact in a new light. And\nthen the whole problem rearranges itself.\u201d \u201cI am indebted to you for your lucid exposition,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Pulteney, \u201cbut even now the events of the\npast week are not quite clear to me.\u201d \u201cMiles, don\u2019t be tiresome,\u201d said Angela. \u201cStart\nright from the beginning, and don\u2019t let\u2019s have any\nmystery-making.\u201d \u201cAll right. It would make a better story the other\nway, but still\u2014well, first you want to get some\npicture of Mottram. I can only do it by guesswork,\nbut I should say this: He had an enormous amount\nof money, and no heir whom he cared for. He was\na shrewd, rather grasping man, and he came to think\nthat everybody else was after his money. It\u2019s not\nuncommon with rich people\u2014what you might call\nthe Chuzzlewit-complex. Am I right so far?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d said the Bishop. \u201cAgain, he was a man who loved a mystery for\nits own sake, surprises, almost practical jokes. And\nagain, he was a vain man in some ways, caring\nintensely what other people thought of him, and very\nanxious to know what they thought of him. Also,\nhe had a high respect for the Catholic Church, or\nat least for its representatives in Pullford.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s true,\u201d said Eames. \u201cWell, I think he really did mean to leave some\nmoney to the Pullford Diocese. No, don\u2019t interrupt;\nthat\u2019s not as obvious as it sounds. He really did\nmean to endow the diocese, and he disclosed his\nintention to Brinkman. Brinkman, as we know, was\na real anti-clerical, and he protested violently.\nCatholics were alike, he said, all the world over; the\napparent honesty of a man like Your Lordship was\nonly a blind. In reality Catholics, and especially\nCatholic priests, were always hunting for money and\nwould do anything to get it\u2014anything. At last\nMottram determined that he must settle the point for\nhimself. First of all, he went round to the Cathedral\nhouse and defended the proposition that it was\nlawful to do evil in order that good might come. He\nwanted to see whether he would get any support\nfor that view in the abstract; he got none. Then he\ndecided, with Brinkman\u2019s collaboration, on a\npractical test. He would put Your Lordship\u2019s honesty to\nthe proof. \u201cHe went up to London, saw his solicitors, and\nadded a codicil to his will, leaving the benefits of the\nEuthanasia policy to the Bishop of Pullford. I am\nafraid it must be admitted that he did not, at the\ntime, mean that codicil to become operative. It was\npart of his mystery. Then he went on to our people\nat the Indescribable, and spun a cock-and-bull yarn\nabout seeing a specialist, who had told him that he\nhad only two more years to live. Actually he was in\nrobust health; he only invented this story and told\nit to the Indescribable in order that, when it came\nto the point, it might be reasonable (though not\nnecessary) to explain his death as suicide. Then he came,\nback here and made preparations for his holiday.\nHe was going to take his holiday at Chilthorpe\u2014to\nbe more accurate, he meant to start his holiday at\nChilthorpe. He strongly urged Your Lordship to\ncome down and share part of it with him; it was\nessential to his plan.\u201d \u201cAnd that,\u201d suggested the Bishop, \u201cexplains his\nintense eagerness that I should come down?\u201d \u201cPrecisely. He made certain, as best he could, that\nyou would arrive here on the morning after him;\nthat you would be told he had gone out to fish the\nLong Pool, and that you would be asked to follow\nhim. This would ensure that you would be the first\nwitness of his disappearance.\u201d \u201cHis what?\u201d \u201cHis disappearance. He meant to disappear. Not\nonly for the sake of the test, I imagine; he wanted to\ndisappear for the fun of the thing; to see what\nhappened. He wanted to be a celebrity in the\nnewspapers. He wanted to read his own obituaries. That\nwas why he wrote, or rather got Brinkman to write,\na letter to the Pullford Examiner, calling him all\nsorts of names\u2014the letter was signed, of course, with\na pseudonym. You found that out, didn\u2019t you,\nLeyland?\u201d \u201cYes, confound it all, I heard only this morning\nthat \u2018Brutus\u2019 was really Brinkman. But I never saw\nthe point.\u201d \u201cThen he sat down and wrote an unfinished letter\nin answer to these charges. That letter, of course,\nwas to be found after his disappearance, and would\nbe published in thick type by the Pullford Examiner.\nThat would set everybody talking about him, and\nhis obituary notices would be lively reading. He\nwanted to read them himself. But in order to do that\nhe must disappear. \u201cThe Chilthorpe gorge is a good place to\ndisappear from. Leave your hat on the edge of it, and go\nand hide somewhere\u2014you will be reported the next\nmorning as a tragic accident. Mottram had made\nall arrangements for hiding. He was going to spend\nhis holiday incognito somewhere; I think in Ireland,\nbut it may have been on the Continent. He was\ngoing to take Brinkman with him. He would\ndisappear, of course, in his car. He had victualled it\nbefore he left Pullford. On his arrival at Chilthorpe\nhis first act was to paint out its number-plate. He hid\nsome notes in the cushions of the car\u2014that, I think,\nwas a mere instinct of secretiveness; there was no\nneed to do so. \u201cThe plan, then, was this. On Tuesday morning,\nearly, Mottram was to set out for the gorge. Almost\nimmediately afterward, Brinkman was to take out\nthe motor, as if to go to Pullford. He was to pick up\nMottram, who would hide under the seat or disguise\nhimself or smuggle himself away somehow, and\ndrive like mad for the coast. Later, you, My Lord,\nwould come to the Load of Mischief, and would get\nthe message about going out to join Mottram at the\nLong Pool. In passing through the gorge, you would\n(I fancy) have found some traces there\u2014Mottram\u2019s\nhat, for example, or his fishing-rod; and your first\nthought would have been that the poor fellow had\nslipped in. Then, looking round, you would find this\nletter half-concealed on a high ledge. You would\nread it, and you would think that Mottram had\ncommitted suicide. \u201cAnd then\u2014then you would either make the\ncontents of this letter public or you wouldn\u2019t. If\nBrinkman was right in his estimate, you would keep\nthe letter dark; the death, before long, would be\npresumed. The Indescribable Company would have\nbeen on the point of paying out the half-million\nwhen\u2014Mottram would have reappeared, and Your\nLordship would have been in a delicate position. If\nMottram was right in his view of your character,\nthen you would produce the letter; Mottram\u2019s death\nwould be regarded as suicide, and the Indescribable\nwould refuse all claims. Then Mottram would have\nreappeared, and would have seen to it that, in one\nway or another, the Pullford Diocese should be\nrewarded for the honesty of its Bishop. \u201cHe was not really a very complete conspirator,\npoor Mottram. He made three bad mistakes, as it\nproved. Though indeed they would not have\nmattered, or two of them would not have mattered, if\nevents had proceeded according to plan. \u201cIn the first place, he went and wrote his name\nin the visitors\u2019 book immediately on arrival. He\nwanted to leave no doubt that it was Jephthah\nMottram in person who arrived at the Load of Mischief\non Monday night. He wanted journalists to come\ndown here and look reverently at the great man\u2019s\nsignature. Of course, in reality, it is a thing nobody ever\ndoes on the night of arrival. It has made me\nsuspicious from the very first, as my wife will tell you. \u201cIn the second place, when he took the precaution\nof drawing up a new will he neglected to sign it\novernight. Brinkman, I suppose, pointed out to him that\nif any fatal accident occurred\u2014say a motor accident\u2014the\ncodicil leaving the half-million to the Bishop\nwould be perfectly valid. To avoid this danger they\nmust have drawn up a new will, and if Mottram had\nsigned this overnight his death would have made it\nvalid. As it was, for some reason\u2014probably because\nBrinkman himself was drawing it up (I think the\nwriting is Brinkman\u2019s) late on Monday night\u2014the\nwill was never signed and was useless. \u201cIn the third place, he did something overnight\nwhich he ought to have left till the next morning.\nHe not only wrote his confidential letter to the\nBishop but he went out with Brinkman to the gorge\nand posted it\u2014put it on the ledge ready for the\nBishop to find next morning. He did not mean to go\ninto the gorge at all the next morning. He would\nstart out on the way to it, say, at eight, and at ten\nminutes past eight Brinkman, driving the car, would\npick him up on the road. From the side of the road\nthey could throw over Mottram\u2019s hat, possibly, and\nthey could slide his rod down the rocks, so as to\nmake it appear that he had been there. (Brinkman,\nin this way, would establish an alibi; he could not be\nsupposed to have murdered Mottram in the gorge.)\nBut it was not safe to let the letter drop in this\ncasual way; therefore the letter must be planted out\novernight. There was no great danger of its\npremature discovery; in any case, Mottram put it rather\nout of sight on a ledge so high up that only a tall\nman would see it, and only if he was looking about\nhim carefully. \u201cThat is the complicated part of this business; the\nrest of it depends on two simple accidents. Mottram\nwent to bed rather early; he was in an excited frame\nof mind, and determined to steady himself with a\nsleeping draught. The watch, the studs, were only\nsymptoms of that fussiness we all feel on the eve of\na great adventure. I suppose he borrowed a match\nfrom Brinkman to light his gas with. But it was a\nclear night; there was no need of light to go to bed\nby. But just at the last moment\u2014a fateful moment\nfor himself\u2014he did light the gas; perhaps he wanted\nto read a page or two of his novel before turning in. \u201cThe rest of the story could be more easily told\nupstairs. I wonder if you would mind all coming\nup into the actual room? It makes it so much easier\nto construct the scene if you are on the spot.\u201d The whole party applauded this decision. \u201cThis is\nwhat is called an object-lesson, in the education of\nthe young,\u201d observed Mr. Pulteney. \u201cThe young like\nit; they are in a position to hack one another\u2019s shins\nwhen the teacher\u2019s back is turned.\u201d When they reached the bedroom, Bredon found\nhimself falling into the attitude of a lecturer. \u201cThe\nguide,\u201d murmured Angela, \u201ctaking a party round\nthe ruins of the old dungeon. Scene of the \u2019orrible\ncrime. Please pay attention, gentlemen!\u201d \u201cYou see how the gas works in here,\u201d began\nBredon. \u201cThere\u2019s the main tap, we\u2019ll call it A, which\ncontrols the whole supply. Tap B is for the bracket;\ntap C leads through the tube to the standard lamp.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter leaving tap B or tap C on as long\nas tap A is turned off. \u201cWhen Mottram went up to bed, tap B and tap\nC were both open, but tap A was properly turned\noff. Mottram took no particular notice of the\ndisposition of taps; he turned on one tap at random,\ntap A. Then he lit his match, and put it to the\nbracket, which naturally lit. He then immediately\nthrew the match away. We know that, because we\nfound the match, and it was hardly burned down the\nstalk at all. Meanwhile, of course, he had also\nallowed the gas to escape through the tube into the\nstandard lamp; it never occurred to him to light\nthis. The standard was at the other end of the room,\nclose to the open window; the slight escape of gas\ndid not, unfortunately for him, offend his nostrils.\nBrinkman told me, and it is probably true, that\nMottram had not a very keen sense of smell. After\na minute or two, feeling ready to go to sleep, he\nwent up to the taps again, and forgot to reverse the\nprocess he had gone through before. Instead of\nturning off the main tap, A, he carelessly turned off tap\nB. And the light on the bracket obediently went out. \u201cThat is the lesson of a finger-print. Tap A was\nstiff, and Mottram left a mark when he turned it\non; he would have left another if he had turned it\noff. He did not; he turned off tap B, which works at\na mere touch, and of course he left no mark in\ndoing so. There, then, lies Mottram; the sleeping\ndraught has already taken effect; the wind gets up,\nand blows the window to; tap A is still open, and\ntap C is still open; and through the burner of the\nstandard lamp the acetylene is pouring into the\nroom. \u201cBrinkman is not a late sleeper. The Boots, who\nis the earliest riser in this establishment, tells me\nthat Brinkman was always awake when he went\nround for the shoes. On Tuesday morning Brinkman\nmust have woken early, to be greeted by a smell of\ngas. It may have crept in through his window, or\neven come up through the floor, for the floors here\nare full of cracks. Once he had satisfied himself that\nthe escape was not in his own room, he must have\nthought of the room below. When he reached the\nlower passage, the increasing smell of gas left him in\nno doubt. He knocked at Mottram\u2019s door, got no\nanswer, and rushed in, going straight across and\nopening the window so as to get some air. Then he\nhad time to turn round and see what was on the\nbed. There was no doubt that he was too late to\nhelp.\u201d \u201cDid he know it was accident?\u201d asked Eames.\n\u201cOr did he think it was suicide?\u201d \u201cI think he must have known it was accident.\nAnd now, consider his position. Here was Mottram,\ndead by accident. There up in London was\nMottram\u2019s codicil, willing half a million to the Diocese of\nPullford. And that codicil had not been meant to\nbecome operative. It had been made only for the\npurposes of the test. And now, through this accident,\nthe codicil, which did not represent Mottram\u2019s real\nwishes, had suddenly become valid. It would\ncertainly be judged valid, unless\u2014unless the claim were\ndismissed owing to a verdict of suicide. Brinkman\nmay or may not have been a good man; he was\ncertainly a good secretary. Put yourself in his\nposition, Mr. Eames. He could only give effect to his\ndead master\u2019s real wishes by pretending that his\ndead master had committed suicide. \u201cYou remember the remark in \u2018The Importance of\nBeing Earnest,\u2019 that to lose one parent may be an\naccident, to lose both looks like carelessness? So it\nwas with Mottram and the taps. Two taps turned on\nmeant, and would be understood to mean, an\naccident. But, and this is worth remembering, if all three\ntaps were found on, it would look like suicide.\nBrinkman acted on the spur of the moment; he was in a\nhurry, for the atmosphere of the room was still\ndeadly. He wrapped his handkerchief round his\nfingers, so as to leave no mark, then, in his confusion,\nhe turned the wrong tap! He meant to turn tap B\non; instead, he turned tap A off. That sounds\nimpossible, I know. But you will notice that whereas\ntap A and tap B are turned off when they are at the\nhorizontal, tap C is turned off when it is at the\nvertical, When Brinkman, then, saw the three taps, B\nand C were both horizontal, and A was vertical, it\nwas natural, in the flurry of the moment, for him to\nimagine that if all three taps were in the same\nposition (that is, all horizontal) they would all be turned\non. Instinctively, then, he turned tap A from the\nvertical to the horizontal. And in doing so he left\nthe whole three in the same position in which they\nwere before Mottram lit his match. No gas was\nescaping at all. The result of Brinkman\u2019s action was\nnot to corroborate the theory of suicide, but to\nintroduce a quite new theory\u2014that of murder.\nHalf-stifled, he rushed from the room, locked the door on\nthe outside, and took the key away with him up to\nhis room.\u201d \u201cSteady on,\u201d put in Angela, \u201cwhy did he lock the\ndoor?\u201d \u201cIt may have been only so as to keep the room\nprivate till he had thought the thing out, and the\nBoots may have come round too soon for him. Or,\nmore probably, it was another deliberate effort to\nencourage the idea of suicide. Anyhow, his actions\nfrom that moment onward were perfectly\nclear-headed. He helped to break down the door, and,\nwhile Ferrers was examining the gas, while the Boots\nwas lighting a match, he thrust the key in on the\ninner side of the door. It was only when he had done\nthis, when he thought that he had made the suicide\ntheory an absolute certainty, that he was suddenly\nconfronted with the horrible mistake he had made\nin turning the wrong tap. It was a bad moment for\nhim, but fortunately one which excused a certain\ndisplay of emotion.\u201d \u201cAnd he thought he would be run in for the\nmurder?\u201d asked Leyland. \u201cNot necessarily. But your arrival worried him\nbadly; you got hold of the murder idea from the\nstart.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he skip, then? There was the car,\nall ready provisioned.\u201d \u201cThe trouble is that Brinkman is, according to his\nlights, an honest man. And he hated the idea of the\nEuthanasia money going to the Bishop. I was a\ngodsend to him; here was a nice, stupid man, briefed to\ndefend the thesis of suicide. As soon as I came, he\ntried to take me out for a walk in the gorge.\u201d \u201cWhy in the gorge?\u201d asked the Bishop. \u201cSo that I should find the letter. Yesterday he did\nmanage to take me to the gorge, and actually drew\nmy attention to the ledge. I saw a bit of paper there,\nbut it never occurred to me to wonder what it was.\nPoor Brinkman! He must have thought me an ass!\u201d \u201cBut why didn\u2019t he get the letter himself, and\nbring it to us? Or leave it lying about?\u201d \u201cThat was the maddening thing, the poor little\nman just couldn\u2019t reach it. The wind of Monday\nnight had blown it a bit further away, I suspect. Of\ncourse, he could have gone out with a step-ladder, or\nrolled stones up to stand on. But, you see, you were\nwatching him, and I\u2019m pretty sure he knew you were\nwatching him. He thought it best to lead us on,\nlead me on rather, and make me find out the\nenvelope for myself. When he\u2019d drawn me right across\nthe trail of it, and I\u2019d failed to see it, he was in\ndespair. He decided that he must bolt after all. It\nwas too horrible a position to be here under\nobservation, and fearing arrest at any moment. If he\nwere arrested, you see, he must either tell a lie, and\nland himself in suspicion, or tell the truth, and see\nthe Euthanasia money fall into Catholic hands. \u201cHe ordered a car from the garage to meet the\ntrain which arrives at Chilthorpe at 8.40. He\ndetermined to meet it on the way to the station. I\ndon\u2019t think the thought of the car lying at the\ngarage, with the \u2018sangwiches\u2019\u2014I mean the sandwiches\u2014and\nthe whisky on board, occurred to him for a\nmoment. He is an honest man. But on his way to\nmeet the car he would go through the gorge, and\nmake sure that he was followed; he would draw\nattention to the document, and then disappear from\nthe scene. He had not much luggage; he had only\nto clear up a few papers, mostly belonging to\nMottram. Among these was the unsigned will which had\nbeen drawn up, ready for Mottram\u2019s signature, on\nthe Monday night. This he burned; it could be no\nuse to anybody now. He burned it standing at the\nwindow, and the last, unburnt piece escaped from his\nfingers, and fluttered down through a second window\ninto the room below\u2014this room, which had been\nMottram\u2019s. That was your find, Leyland. And the\nodd thing is that it was through this absurd detail\nthat I got onto the track of the whole thing; because\none of my patience cards fluttered down through\na ground-floor window; and as I was carrying it\nupstairs I realized that was how the scrap of paper\ncame to be lying about in Mottram\u2019s room. Then I\nbegan wondering what the will was, and why\nBrinkman should have been burning it, and suddenly the\nwhole truth began to sketch itself in my mind, just\nas I\u2019ve been telling it you. \u201cBrinkman had bad luck to the last. I dropped\nthat card just after he started out with his\ndespatch-box; he saw that I\u2019d disappeared from the window,\nand supposed, with delight, that I was following him.\nWith delight, for of course I was the one man who\nwas interested in proving the death to be suicide.\nHe went back to the cache in the gorge, leading me\n(as he supposed) all the way; then he waited for a\nflash of lightning, and jumped up so as to draw\nattention to the envelope. As he came down again\nhe looked round, and, in the last rays of the\nlightning flash, saw that it was Eames, not I, who was\nfollowing him. Eames\u2014the one man who would\ncertainly make away with the precious document! But\nthere was no time to be lost; he could hear the taxi\nalready on the hill. He ran round to the road, leaped\non board the taxi, and, in desperation, sent a note\nto me by the taxi-man telling me to make Eames\nshew me what he had found. I don\u2019t know where\nBrinkman is now, but I rather hope he gets clear.\u201d \u201cAmen to that,\u201d said Leyland; \u201cit would be\nuncommonly awkward for us if we found him. What\non earth could we charge him with? You can\u2019t hang\na man for turning the wrong gas-tap by mistake.\u201d \u201cPoor Mr. Simmonds will be relieved about this,\u201d\nsaid Angela. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said the Bishop, \u201cI hear that\nMottram did leave some unsettled estate after all, and\nthat, I suppose, will go to Simmonds. Not a great\ndeal, but it\u2019s enough for him to marry on.\u201d Angela swears that at this point she heard, on\nthe other side of the door, a scuffle and the rustle of\ndeparting footsteps. She says you can\u2019t cure maids\nof their bad habits, really. \u201cMy own difficulty,\u201d said the Bishop, \u201cis about\nmy moral claim to this money. For it was left to me,\nit seems, by a will which the testator did not mean\nto take effect.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, you\u2019ve earned it, My Lord,\u201d\nsuggested Bredon. \u201cAfter all, poor Mottram was\nonly waiting to find out whether you would prove\nto be an honest man or not. And I think you\u2019ve come\nout of the test very well. Besides, you can\u2019t refuse\nthe legacy; it\u2019s in trust for the diocese. I hope\nPullford will see a lot of Catholic activity now.\u201d \u201cThe church collections will be beginning to fall\noff almost at once,\u201d said Eames, with a melancholy\nface. \u201cI wish I had scrutinized those motor-cushions\nmore closely,\u201d said Mr. Pulteney. \u201cIt seems to me\nthat I get nothing out of all this.\u201d \u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d said Leyland, \u201cI suppose\nthe bet\u2019s off.\u201d \u201cAnd Mr. Bredon,\u201d added the Bishop, \u201cwill get\nno thanks from his company. I\u2019m afraid, Mr.\nBredon, you will have carried nothing away with you\nfrom your visit to these parts.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d said Bredon."

        "\n      A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree\n      which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the\n      time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of\n      them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\n      gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\n      eldest son to watch; but about twelve o\u2019clock he fell asleep, and in the\n      morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered\n      to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another\n      apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener\n      at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him:\n      however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the\n      tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the\n      air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping\n      at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\u2019s son jumped up and shot\n      an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a\n      golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was\n      brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called\n      together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of\n      the kingdom: but the king said, \u2018One feather is of no use to me, I must\n      have the whole bird.",

        "\n      There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\n      wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any\n      shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl,\n      or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an\n      old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her\n      castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and\n      set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never\n      to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she\n      was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her\n      up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages\n      hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.",

        "\n      In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of\n      beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that\n      it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When\n      she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing\n      it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning\n      coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said:\n      \u2018Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\u2019 The coal replied: \u2018I\n      fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer\n      force, my death would have been certain,\u2014I should have been burnt to\n      ashes.\u2019 The bean said: \u2018I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the\n      old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth\n      without any mercy, like my comrades.\u2019 \u2018And would a better fate have fallen\n      to my lot?\u2019 said the straw. \u2018The old woman has destroyed all my brethren\n      in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.\n      I luckily slipped through her fingers.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018But what are we to do now?\u2019 said the coal.\n     \n      \u2018I think,\u2019 answered the bean, \u2018that as we have so fortunately escaped\n      death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\n      mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair\n      to a foreign country.\u2019\n     \n      The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\n      together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no\n      bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it. The\n      straw hit on a good idea, and said: \u2018I will lay myself straight across,\n      and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\u2019 The straw therefore\n      stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an\n      impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge.\n      But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath\n      her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.\n      The straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the\n      stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water,\n      and breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the\n      shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed\n      so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with her,\n      likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of\n      work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate\n      heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The\n      bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all\n      beans since then have a black seam.\n    ",
        "\n      A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\n      where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had plenty\n      of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to\n      eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had\n      been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very\n      much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the\n      river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had\n      thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the\n      bank. Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again\n      into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the\n      water and said, \u2018I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in\n      return for your kindness to me\u2014you will soon have a daughter.\u2019 What\n      the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little\n      girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for\n      joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the\n      child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends,\n      and neighbours. But the queen said, \u2018I will have the fairies also, that\n      they might be kind and good to our little daughter.\u2019 Now there were\n      thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve\n      golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the\n      fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red\n      cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long\n      white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round\n      in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave\n      her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all\n      that was good in the world.\n     \n      Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\n      the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come,\n      with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\n      broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\n      Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\n      scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.\n      So she cried out, \u2018The king\u2019s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be\n      wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\u2019 Then the twelfth of the\n      friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said\n      that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\n      mischief; so her gift was, that the king\u2019s daughter, when the spindle\n      wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\n      hundred years.\n     \n      However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the\n      threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should\n      be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were\n      in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well\n      behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her.\n     \n      It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and\n      queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved\n      about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last\n      she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending\n      with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she\n      turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away\n      very busily. \u2018Why, how now, good mother,\u2019 said the princess; \u2018what are you\n      doing there?\u2019 \u2018Spinning,\u2019 said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming\n      a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. \u2018How prettily that little thing turns\n      round!\u2019 said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin.\n      But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy\u2019s prophecy was\n      fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the\n      ground.\n     \n      However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the\n      king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell\n      asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the\n      court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the\n      walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep;\n      the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it\n      for the king\u2019s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment\n      pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for\n      something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler,\n      who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and\n      thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\n     \n      A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\n      became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and\n      hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there\n      went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose\n      (for so the king\u2019s daughter was called): so that, from time to time,\n      several kings\u2019 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the\n      palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and\n      bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck\n      fast, and died wretchedly.\n     \n      After many, many years there came a king\u2019s son into that land: and an old\n      man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\n      palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\n      lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from\n      his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break\n      through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died.\n      Then the young prince said, \u2018All this shall not frighten me; I will go and\n      see this Briar Rose.\u2019 The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent\n      upon going.\n     \n      Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to\n      the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which\n      he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he\n      came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep;\n      and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the\n      pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came\n      into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was\n      standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink\n      a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and\n      the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going\n      to beat the boy.\n     \n      Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\n      every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\n      the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\n      fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\n      could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\n      But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\n      upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\n      awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. And\n      the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\n      pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew\n      into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the\n      kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the\n      goose for the king\u2019s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of\n      ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box\n      on his ear.\n     \n      And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was\n      given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\n    ",
        "\n      A shepherd\u2019s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\n      suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took\n      to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road\n      he met a sparrow that said to him, \u2018Why are you so sad, my friend?\u2019\n      \u2018Because,\u2019 said the dog, \u2018I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.\u2019\n      \u2018If that be all,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018come with me into the next town,\n      and I will soon find you plenty of food.\u2019 So on they went together into\n      the town: and as they passed by a butcher\u2019s shop, the sparrow said to the\n      dog, \u2018Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.\u2019 So\n      the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully\n      about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a\n      steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then\n      the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he\n      soon ate it all up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018you shall have some more if\n      you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down\n      another steak.\u2019 When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him,\n      \u2018Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?\u2019 \u2018I have had plenty of\n      meat,\u2019 answered he, \u2018but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat\n      after it.\u2019 \u2018Come with me then,\u2019 said the sparrow, \u2018and you shall soon have\n      that too.\u2019 So she took him to a baker\u2019s shop, and pecked at two rolls that\n      lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for\n      more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When\n      that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now.\n      \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he; \u2018and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\u2019\n      So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm,\n      they had not gone far before the dog said, \u2018I am very much tired\u2014I\n      should like to take a nap.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered the sparrow, \u2018do so, and\n      in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.\u2019 So the dog stretched himself\n      out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a\n      carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of\n      wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but\n      would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him,\n      called out, \u2018Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\u2019 But\n      the carter, grumbling to himself, \u2018You make it the worse for me, indeed!\n      what can you do?\u2019 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog,\n      so that the wheels crushed him to death. \u2018There,\u2019 cried the sparrow, \u2018thou\n      cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say.\n      This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\u2019 \u2018Do your worst,\n      and welcome,\u2019 said the brute, \u2018what harm can you do me?\u2019 and passed on.\n      But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung\n      of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out,\n      without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the\n      cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. \u2018What an unlucky wretch I\n      am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow, as she alighted\n      upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up\n      and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a\n      blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow\n      fell upon the poor horse\u2019s head with such force, that he fell down dead.\n      \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the\n      sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again\n      crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second\n      cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again\n      cried out, \u2018Miserable wretch that I am!\u2019 But the sparrow answered, \u2018Not\n      wretch enough yet!\u2019 and perched on the head of the second horse, and\n      pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his\n      hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and\n      killed him on the spot. \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 said he. \u2018Not wretch\n      enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she\n      began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking\n      about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but\n      killed his third horse as he done the other two. \u2018Alas! miserable wretch\n      that I am!\u2019 cried he. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 answered the sparrow as she\n      flew away; \u2018now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\u2019 The\n      carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\n      overflowing with rage and vexation. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said he to his wife, \u2018what ill\n      luck has befallen me!\u2014my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\n      dead.\u2019 \u2018Alas! husband,\u2019 replied she, \u2018and a wicked bird has come into the\n      house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and\n      they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a\n      rate!\u2019 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting\n      upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them.\n      \u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was\n      almost all gone. \u2018Not wretch enough yet!\u2019 said the sparrow; \u2018thy cruelty\n      shall cost thee thy life yet!\u2019 and away she flew.\n     \n      The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into\n      his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself\n      angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the\n      outside of the window, and cried \u2018Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy\n      life!\u2019 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it\n      at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow\n      now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and cried, \u2018Carter! it shall\n      cost thee thy life!\u2019 Then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck\n      the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the\n      sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious,\n      that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table,\n      and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end,\n      however, they caught her: and the wife said, \u2018Shall I kill her at once?\u2019\n      \u2018No,\u2019 cried he, \u2018that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much\n      more cruel death; I will eat her.\u2019 But the sparrow began to flutter about,\n      and stretch out her neck and cried, \u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life\n      yet!\u2019 With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet,\n      and cried, \u2018Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\u2019 And the\n      wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so\n      that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\n    ",

They slept in twelve\n      beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and\n      locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn\n      through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find\n      out how it happened, or where they had been.\n     \n      Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\n      discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced\n      in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and\n      should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed,\n      after three days and nights, should be put to death.\n     \n      A king\u2019s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\n      taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\n      twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and,\n      in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his\n      chamber was left open. But the king\u2019s son soon fell asleep; and when he\n      awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing,\n      for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened\n      the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off.\n      After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all\n      lost their lives in the same manner.\n     \n      Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and\n      could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned:\n      and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked\n      him where he was going. \u2018I hardly know where I am going, or what I had\n      better do,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018but I think I should like very well to find\n      out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a\n      king.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old dame, \u2018that is no very hard task: only take\n      care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring\n      to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast\n      asleep.\u2019\n     \n      Then she gave him a cloak, and said, \u2018As soon as you put that on you will\n      become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the princesses\n      wherever they go.\u2019 When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he\n      determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was\n      willing to undertake the task.\n     \n      He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine\n      royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the\n      outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the\n      princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away\n      secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on\n      his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast\n      asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and\n      the eldest said, \u2018This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose\n      his life in this way!\u2019 Then they rose up and opened their drawers and\n      boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the\n      glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the\n      youngest said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very\n      uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us.\u2019 \u2018You simpleton,\u2019 said\n      the eldest, \u2018you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings\u2019\n      sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had\n      not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.\u2019\n     \n      When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\n      snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite\n      safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the\n      bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier saw them\n      going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the\n      way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak\n      which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of\n      the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out\n      to her sisters, \u2018All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.\u2019 \u2018You\n      silly creature!\u2019 said the eldest, \u2018it is nothing but a nail in the wall.\u2019\n      Then down they all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most\n      delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and\n      glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some\n      token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud\n      noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, \u2018I am sure all\n      is not right\u2014did not you hear that noise? That never happened\n      before.\u2019 But the eldest said, \u2018It is only our princes, who are shouting\n      for joy at our approach.\u2019\n     \n      Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\n      gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\n      diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\n      was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\n      the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\n      So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\n      lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\n      who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\n     \n      One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\n      the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\n      prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\n      said, \u2018I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\n      we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems\n      very heavy today.\u2019 \u2018It is only the heat of the weather,\u2019 said the\n      princess: \u2018I feel it very warm too.\u2019\n     \n      On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which\n      came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and\n      went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the\n      soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when\n      any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so\n      that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this, too, the\n      youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced\n      her. They danced on till three o\u2019clock in the morning, and then all their\n      shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off. The princes\n      rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed\n      himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore\n      they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the\n      next night.\n     \n      When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\n      and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much\n      tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, \u2018Now all is quite\n      safe\u2019; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled\n      off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the soldier said nothing\n      about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange\n      adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing\n      happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes\n      were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night\n      the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had\n      been.\n     \n      As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\n      before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve\n      princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. And\n      when the king asked him. \u2018Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?\u2019 he\n      answered, \u2018With twelve princes in a castle under ground.\u2019 And then he told\n      the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the\n      golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the\n      princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and\n      when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny\n      what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier\n      which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, \u2018I am not\n      very young, so I will have the eldest.\u2019\u2014And they were married that\n      very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king\u2019s heir.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by\n      the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one\n      day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves\n      and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep\n      into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish. But the\n      fish said, \u2018Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an enchanted\n      prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!\u2019 \u2018Oh, ho!\u2019 said the man,\n      \u2018you need not make so many words about the matter; I will have nothing to\n      do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!\u2019\n      Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to\n      the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave.\n     \n      When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he\n      had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\n      prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. \u2018Did not you\n      ask it for anything?\u2019 said the wife, \u2018we live very wretchedly here, in\n      this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\n      little cottage.\u2019\n     \n      The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\n      seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\n      green. And he stood at the water\u2019s edge, and said:\n     \n      Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, \u2018Well, what is her will?\n      What does your wife want?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018she says that when I\n      had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you\n      go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug\n      little cottage.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is in the cottage\n      already!\u2019 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a\n      nice trim little cottage. \u2018Come in, come in!\u2019 said she; \u2018is not this much\n      better than the filthy pigsty we had?\u2019 And there was a parlour, and a\n      bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little\n      garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a\n      courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman,\n      \u2018how happily we shall live now!\u2019 \u2018We will try to do so, at least,\u2019 said\n      his wife.\n     \n      Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\n      \u2018Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\n      courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to have\n      a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give\n      us a castle.\u2019 \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go to him\n      again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty\n      cottage to live in.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said the wife; \u2018he will do it very\n      willingly, I know; go along and try!\u2019\n     \n      The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the\n      sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close\n      to the edge of the waves, and said:\n     \n      \u2018Well, what does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the man,\n      dolefully, \u2018my wife wants to live in a stone castle.\u2019 \u2018Go home, then,\u2019\n      said the fish; \u2018she is standing at the gate of it already.\u2019 So away went\n      the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\n      castle. \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018is not this grand?\u2019 With that they went into the\n      castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all\n      richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the\n      castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of\n      sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables\n      and cow-houses. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the man, \u2018now we will live cheerful and happy\n      in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps we may,\u2019\n      said the wife; \u2018but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to\n      that.\u2019 So they went to bed.\n     \n      The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she\n      jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \u2018Get up, husband, and\n      bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said\n      the man, \u2018why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.\u2019 \u2018Then I\n      will,\u2019 said she. \u2018But, wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018how can you be king\u2014the\n      fish cannot make you a king?\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018say no more about it,\n      but go and try! I will be king.\u2019 So the man went away quite sorrowful to\n      think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a\n      dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of\n      foam as he cried out:\n     \n      \u2018Well, what would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the poor man,\n      \u2018my wife wants to be king.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is king\n      already.\u2019\n     \n      Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a\n      troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when he\n      went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a\n      golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair\n      maidens, each a head taller than the other. \u2018Well, wife,\u2019 said the\n      fisherman, \u2018are you king?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am king.\u2019 And when he had\n      looked at her for a long time, he said, \u2018Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is\n      to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as\n      we live.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know how that may be,\u2019 said she; \u2018never is a long time.\n      I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I\n      should like to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Alas, wife! why should you wish to be\n      emperor?\u2019 said the fisherman. \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018go to the fish! I say\n      I will be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah, wife!\u2019 replied the fisherman, \u2018the fish cannot\n      make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a\n      thing.\u2019 \u2018I am king,\u2019 said Ilsabill, \u2018and you are my slave; so go at once!\u2019\n     \n      So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, \u2018This\n      will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at\n      last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\u2019 He soon came to\n      the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty\n      whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near\n      as he could to the water\u2019s brink, and said:\n     \n      \u2018What would she have now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018she\n      wants to be emperor.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is emperor already.\u2019\n     \n      So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\n      sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\n      her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and\n      attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest\n      giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And before her\n      stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and\n      said, \u2018Wife, are you emperor?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am emperor.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said\n      the man, as he gazed upon her, \u2018what a fine thing it is to be emperor!\u2019\n      \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope\n      next.\u2019 \u2018O wife, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018how can you be pope? there is but one\n      pope at a time in Christendom.\u2019 \u2018Husband,\u2019 said she, \u2018I will be pope this\n      very day.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 replied the husband, \u2018the fish cannot make you pope.\u2019\n      \u2018What nonsense!\u2019 said she; \u2018if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope:\n      go and try him.\u2019\n     \n      So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\n      and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were in\n      trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle\n      of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south\n      all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the\n      fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees\n      knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:\n     \n      \u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the fisherman, \u2018my\n      wife wants to be pope.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish; \u2018she is pope already.\u2019\n     \n      Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne that\n      was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and around\n      her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side of her\n      were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as large as\n      the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a\n      small rushlight. \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the fisherman, as he looked at all this\n      greatness, \u2018are you pope?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am pope.\u2019 \u2018Well, wife,\u2019\n      replied he, \u2018it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for\n      you can be nothing greater.\u2019 \u2018I will think about that,\u2019 said the wife.\n      Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for\n      thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep,\n      morning broke, and the sun rose. \u2018Ha!\u2019 thought she, as she woke up and\n      looked at it through the window, \u2018after all I cannot prevent the sun\n      rising.\u2019 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and\n      said, \u2018Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and\n      moon.\u2019 The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so\n      much that he started and fell out of bed. \u2018Alas, wife!\u2019 said he, \u2018cannot\n      you be easy with being pope?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am very uneasy as long as\n      the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!\u2019\n     \n      Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the\n      shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook.\n      And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings\n      played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great\n      black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon\n      their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as\n      well as he could:\n     \n      \u2018What does she want now?\u2019 said the fish. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018she wants to be\n      lord of the sun and moon.\u2019 \u2018Go home,\u2019 said the fish, \u2018to your pigsty\n      again.\u2019\n     \n      And there they live to this very day.\n    ",
        "\n      Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and\n      the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: \u2018Brother wolf,\n      what bird is it that sings so well?\u2019 \u2018That is the King of birds,\u2019 said the\n      wolf, \u2018before whom we must bow down.\u2019 In reality the bird was the\n      willow-wren. \u2018IF that\u2019s the case,\u2019 said the bear, \u2018I should very much like\n      to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\u2019 \u2018That is not done quite\n      as you seem to think,\u2019 said the wolf; \u2018you must wait until the Queen\n      comes,\u2019 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and\n      the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear\n      would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve,\n      and said: \u2018No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away\n      again.\u2019 So they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted\n      away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal\n      palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and\n      Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones\n      lying there. \u2018Is that the royal palace?\u2019 cried the bear; \u2018it is a wretched\n      palace, and you are not King\u2019s children, you are disreputable children!\u2019\n      When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and\n      screamed: \u2018No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you\n      will have to pay for that!\u2019\n     \n      The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\n      holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\n      when their parents again brought food they said: \u2018We will not so much as\n      touch one fly\u2019s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\n      settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here\n      and has insulted us!\u2019 Then the old King said: \u2018Be easy, he shall be\n      punished,\u2019 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\u2019s cave, and\n      called in: \u2018Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\n      suffer for it\u2014we will punish you by a bloody war.\u2019 Thus war was\n      announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\n      part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\n      contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air,\n      not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies\n      had to come.\n     \n      When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to\n      discover who was the enemy\u2019s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the\n      most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid\n      herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced.\n      There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: \u2018Fox, you\n      are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us.\u2019\n      \u2018Good,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018but what signal shall we agree upon?\u2019 No one knew\n      that, so the fox said: \u2018I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks\n      like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is\n      going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as\n      fast as you can.\u2019 When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and\n      revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When\n      day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came\n      running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren with\n      his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and\n      whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both\n      sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the\n      hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox\u2019s tail, and sting with all\n      his might. When the fox felt the first string, he started so that he\n      lifted one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in\n      the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment;\n      at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail\n      between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost,\n      and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\n     \n      Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried: \u2018Children,\n      rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\u2019s content, we have won the battle!\u2019\n      But the young wrens said: \u2018We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the\n      nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children, before\n      we will do that.\u2019 Then the willow-wren flew to the bear\u2019s hole and cried:\n      \u2018Growler, you are to come to the nest to my children, and beg their\n      pardon, or else every rib of your body shall be broken.\u2019 So the bear crept\n      thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the\n      young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and\n      made merry till quite late into the night.\n    ",
        "\n      One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\n      out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\n      spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down to\n      rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\n      favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\n      catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\n      she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\n      along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\n      princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\n      deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail her\n      loss, and said, \u2018Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all\n      my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.\u2019\n     \n      Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\n      \u2018Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018what can you\n      do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\u2019 The\n      frog said, \u2018I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if\n      you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden\n      plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.\u2019 \u2018What\n      nonsense,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018this silly frog is talking! He can never\n      even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my\n      ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.\u2019 So\n      she said to the frog, \u2018Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all\n      you ask.\u2019 Then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water;\n      and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and\n      threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her\n      ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her\n      hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as\n      fast as she could. The frog called after her, \u2018Stay, princess, and take me\n      with you as you said,\u2019 But she did not stop to hear a word.\n     \n      The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\n      strange noise\u2014tap, tap\u2014plash, plash\u2014as if something was\n      coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle\n      knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:\n     \n      Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the\n      frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\n      frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\n      seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\n      asked her what was the matter. \u2018There is a nasty frog,\u2019 said she, \u2018at the\n      door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told\n      him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out\n      of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.\u2019\n     \n      While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\n     \n      Then the king said to the young princess, \u2018As you have given your word you\n      must keep it; so go and let him in.\u2019 She did so, and the frog hopped into\n      the room, and then straight on\u2014tap, tap\u2014plash, plash\u2014from\n      the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table\n      where the princess sat. \u2018Pray lift me upon chair,\u2019 said he to the\n      princess, \u2018and let me sit next to you.\u2019 As soon as she had done this, the\n      frog said, \u2018Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\u2019 This\n      she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \u2018Now I am\n      tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\u2019 And the princess,\n      though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\n      pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\n      light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. \u2018Now,\n      then,\u2019 thought the princess, \u2018at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled\n      with him no more.\u2019\n     \n      But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping\n      at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\n     \n      And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon her\n      pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the\n      same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\n      astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\n      with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\n      of her bed.\n     \n      He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\n      changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some\n      princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her\n      plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \u2018You,\u2019 said the prince,\n      \u2018have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that\n      you should go with me into my father\u2019s kingdom, where I will marry you,\n      and love you as long as you live.\u2019\n     \n      The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \u2018Yes\u2019 to all\n      this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses,\n      decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach\n      rode the prince\u2019s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the\n      misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\n      bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\n     \n      They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\n      horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\u2019s\n      kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\n      many years.\n    ",
        "\n      A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\n      to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\n      length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\n      \u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer from\n      hunger,\u2019 said the cat; \u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere,\n      or you will be caught in a trap some day.\u2019 The good advice was followed,\n      and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. At\n      length, after much consideration, the cat said: \u2018I know no place where it\n      will be better stored up than in the church, for no one dares take\n      anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar, and not touch\n      it until we are really in need of it.\u2019 So the pot was placed in safety,\n      but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said\n      to the mouse: \u2018I want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has\n      brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he\n      is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the\n      christening. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by\n      yourself.\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 answered the mouse, \u2018by all means go, and if you\n      get anything very good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet\n      red christening wine myself.\u2019 All this, however, was untrue; the cat had\n      no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight to\n      the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the\n      top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town,\n      looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and\n      licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it\n      was evening did she return home. \u2018Well, here you are again,\u2019 said the\n      mouse, \u2018no doubt you have had a merry day.\u2019 \u2018All went off well,\u2019 answered\n      the cat. \u2018What name did they give the child?\u2019 \u2018Top off!\u2019 said the cat\n      quite coolly. \u2018Top off!\u2019 cried the mouse, \u2018that is a very odd and uncommon\n      name, is it a usual one in your family?\u2019 \u2018What does that matter,\u2019 said the\n      cat, \u2018it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\u2019\n     \n      Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to the\n      mouse: \u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day\n      alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white\n      ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\u2019 The good mouse consented, but the\n      cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot\n      of fat. \u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself,\u2019 said\n      she, and was quite satisfied with her day\u2019s work. When she went home the\n      mouse inquired: \u2018And what was the child christened?\u2019 \u2018Half-done,\u2019 answered\n      the cat. \u2018Half-done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my\n      life, I\u2019ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!\u2019\n     \n      The cat\u2019s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \u2018All good\n      things go in threes,\u2019 said she, \u2018I am asked to stand godmother again. The\n      child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it\n      has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once\n      every few years, you will let me go, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Top-off! Half-done!\u2019\n      answered the mouse, \u2018they are such odd names, they make me very\n      thoughtful.\u2019 \u2018You sit at home,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018in your dark-grey fur coat\n      and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\u2019s because you do not go\n      out in the daytime.\u2019 During the cat\u2019s absence the mouse cleaned the house,\n      and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.\n      \u2018When everything is eaten up one has some peace,\u2019 said she to herself, and\n      well filled and fat she did not return home till night. The mouse at once\n      asked what name had been given to the third child. \u2018It will not please you\n      more than the others,\u2019 said the cat. \u2018He is called All-gone.\u2019 \u2018All-gone,\u2019\n      cried the mouse \u2018that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never\n      seen it in print. All-gone; what can that mean?\u2019 and she shook her head,\n      curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.\n     \n      From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the\n      winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the\n      mouse thought of their provision, and said: \u2018Come, cat, we will go to our\n      pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves\u2014we shall enjoy\n      that.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered the cat, \u2018you will enjoy it as much as you would\n      enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\u2019 They set\n      out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was\n      still in its place, but it was empty. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the mouse, \u2018now I see\n      what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true friend! You have\n      devoured all when you were standing godmother. First top off, then\n      half-done, then\u2014\u2019 \u2018Will you hold your tongue,\u2019 cried the cat, \u2018one\n      word more, and I will eat you too.\u2019 \u2018All-gone\u2019 was already on the poor\n      mouse\u2019s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang on her,\n      seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.\n    ",
        "\n      The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\n      only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\n      mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\n      fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\n      over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\n      great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got\n      ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her mother,\n      packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver;\n      trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride.\n      And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the\n      bridegroom\u2019s hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the\n      princess\u2019s horse was the fairy\u2019s gift, and it was called Falada, and could\n      speak.\n     \n      When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\n      bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and\n      gave it to the princess, and said, \u2018Take care of it, dear child; for it is\n      a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\u2019 Then they all took a\n      sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her\n      bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her bridegroom\u2019s\n      kingdom.\n     \n      One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel\n      very thirsty: and she said to her maid, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some\n      water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.\u2019 \u2018Nay,\u2019\n      said the maid, \u2018if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by\n      the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.\u2019 Then\n      she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and\n      drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and\n      she wept and said, \u2018Alas! what will become of me?\u2019 And the lock answered\n      her, and said:\n     \n      But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\n      maid\u2019s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\n     \n      Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the\n      sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at\n      last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\u2019s rude speech, and\n      said, \u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.\u2019\n      But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before:\n      \u2018Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.\u2019 Then the\n      princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held\n      her head over the running stream, and cried and said, \u2018What will become of\n      me?\u2019 And the lock of hair answered her again:\n     \n      And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and\n      floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not\n      see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm;\n      and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had\n      lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got\n      upon Falada again, the maid said, \u2018I shall ride upon Falada, and you may\n      have my horse instead\u2019; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon\n      afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid\u2019s shabby\n      ones.\n     \n      At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\n      servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\n      happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\n     \n      Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\n      other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\n      royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\n      meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\n      who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but\n      the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\n     \n      Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\n      amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going\n      on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too\n      delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the\n      bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in\n      the court below. \u2018I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the\n      road,\u2019 said she; \u2018pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be\n      idle.\u2019 The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to\n      do; but at last he said, \u2018I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may\n      go and help him.\u2019 Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to\n      help in watching the king\u2019s geese, was Curdken.\n     \n      But the false bride said to the prince, \u2018Dear husband, pray do me one\n      piece of kindness.\u2019 \u2018That I will,\u2019 said the prince. \u2018Then tell one of your\n      slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very\n      unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road\u2019; but the truth was, she was very\n      much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she\n      had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada\n      was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged\n      the man to nail up Falada\u2019s head against a large dark gate of the city,\n      through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she\n      might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as\n      she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.\n     \n      Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she\n      said sorrowfully:\n     \n      and the head answered:\n     \n      Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came\n      to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving\n      locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it\n      glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks\n      out, but she cried:\n     \n      Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken\u2019s hat; and away\n      it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till,\n      by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and\n      had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not\n      speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the\n      evening, and then drove them homewards.\n     \n      The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl\n      looked up at Falada\u2019s head, and cried:\n     \n      and the head answered:\n     \n      Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\n      to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\n      take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\n     \n      Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\n      over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he\n      came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\n      watched the geese till it grew dark.\n     \n      In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\n      said, \u2018I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\n      longer.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the king. \u2018Because, instead of doing any good, she\n      does nothing but tease me all day long.\u2019 Then the king made him tell him\n      what had happened. And Curdken said, \u2018When we go in the morning through\n      the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\n      of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\n     \n      and the head answers:\n     \n      And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\n      where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to\n      run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old\n      king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he\n      placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada,\n      and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a\n      bush by the meadow\u2019s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they\n      drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her\n      hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:\n     \n      And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken\u2019s hat, and away\n      went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\n      hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\n      when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\n      and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \u2018That I\n      must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\u2019\n     \n      But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\n      him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\n      lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\n      royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so\n      beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false\n      bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood\n      by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek\n      and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride,\n      the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The\n      bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the\n      true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite\n      dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little\n      goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\n     \n      When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he\n      would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\n      princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true\n      waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave\n      thus. \u2018Nothing better,\u2019 said this false bride, \u2018than that she should be\n      thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses\n      should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was\n      dead.\u2019 \u2018Thou art she!\u2019 said the old king; \u2018and as thou has judged thyself,\n      so shall it be done to thee.\u2019 And the young king was then married to his\n      true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all\n      their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the\n      faithful Falada to life again.\n    ",
        "\n      1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\n     \n      \u2018The nuts are quite ripe now,\u2019 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\n      \u2018suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\n      before the squirrel takes them all away.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said\n      Partlet, \u2018let us go and make a holiday of it together.\u2019\n     \n      So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\n      there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\n      nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I\n      do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become\n      them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage\n      of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat\n      down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. \u2018That\u2019s\n      a good joke!\u2019 said Chanticleer; \u2018no, that will never do; I had rather by\n      half walk home; I\u2019ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I\u2019ll\n      not draw.\u2019 While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out,\n      \u2018You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I\u2019ll give\n      it you well for your insolence!\u2019 and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer\n      most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck\u2019s blows\n      with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy;\n      which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage\n      home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box,\n      and drove, crying, \u2018Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.\u2019 And away they\n      went at a pretty good pace.\n     \n      After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\n      walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \u2018Stop, stop!\u2019\n      and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\n      dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\n      friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\n      drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that\n      the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage.\n      Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to\n      take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to\n      dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet\u2019s\n      toes.\n     \n      Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the\n      dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from\n      one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters\n      there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was\n      full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they\n      spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the\n      way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying\n      one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome\n      supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\n     \n      Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\n      stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg,\n      they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\n      fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and\n      seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\u2019s easy chair and\n      the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as\n      softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the\n      yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the\n      inn, soon swam out of their reach.\n     \n      An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\n      to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked\n      into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up\n      the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. \u2018Bless me!\u2019 said\n      he, \u2018all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning\u2019:\n      and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear!\n      the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He\n      now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had\n      come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all\n      off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of\n      vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing\n      for his trouble but their apish tricks.\n     \n      2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\n     \n      Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so\n      Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed\n      six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage, and away\n      they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, \u2018Where are you\n      going?\u2019 And Chanticleer replied,\n     \n      Then the cat said, \u2018Take me with you,\u2019 Chanticleer said, \u2018With all my\n      heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.\u2019\n     \n      Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and Chanticleer\n      gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with them.\n     \n      When they arrived at Mr Korbes\u2019s house, he was not at home; so the mice\n      drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew upon\n      a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into the washing\n      cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the millstone laid\n      himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself up in the towel.\n     \n      When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the\n      cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash\n      himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when\n      he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over\n      his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to\n      bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek:\n      at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of\n      the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his\n      head, and killed him on the spot.\n     \n      3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\n     \n      Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to\n      eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be\n      shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she\n      said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however,\n      it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat.\n      Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, \u2018Pray run as\n      fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.\u2019\n      Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, \u2018River, give\n      me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a\n      great nut.\u2019 The river said, \u2018Run first to the bride, and ask her for a\n      silken cord to draw up the water.\u2019 Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said,\n      \u2018Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me\n      water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain,\n      and will be choked by a great nut.\u2019 But the bride said, \u2018Run first, and\n      bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.\u2019 Then\n      Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where\n      it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the\n      silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave\n      him water, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she\n      was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more.\n     \n      Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\n      came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\n      hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\n      themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the\n      fox. \u2018Where are you going, Chanticleer?\u2019 said he. \u2018To bury my Partlet,\u2019\n      said the other. \u2018May I go with you?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018Yes; but you must get\n      up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\u2019 Then the fox got up\n      behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of\n      the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\n     \n      So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \u2018How shall we get over?\u2019\n      said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \u2018I will lay myself across, and you\n      may pass over upon me.\u2019 But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped\n      away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were\n      drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, \u2018I\n      am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass\n      over upon me.\u2019 So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that\n      the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone,\n      who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor\n      Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got\n      safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out\n      of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were\n      too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the\n      stream and drowned.\n     \n      Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a\n      grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her. Then\n      he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too;\n      and so all were dead.\n    ",
        "\n      There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.\n      At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These\n      people had a little window at the back of their house from which a\n      splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\n      flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one\n      dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great\n      power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by\n      this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was\n      planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh\n      and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look\n      pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: \u2018What ails\n      you, dear wife?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018if I can\u2019t eat some of the rampion,\n      which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die.\u2019 The man, who loved\n      her, thought: \u2018Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the\n      rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\u2019 At twilight, he clambered\n      down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a\n      handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a\n      salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her\u2014so very\n      good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.\n      If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the\n      garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but\n      when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the\n      enchantress standing before him. \u2018How can you dare,\u2019 said she with angry\n      look, \u2018descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall\n      suffer for it!\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 answered he, \u2018let mercy take the place of justice, I\n      only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion\n      from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died\n      if she had not got some to eat.\u2019 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to\n      be softened, and said to him: \u2018If the case be as you say, I will allow you\n      to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\n      condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the\n      world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.\u2019\n      The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was\n      brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name\n      of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\n     \n      Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\n      twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a\n      forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little\n      window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath\n      it and cried:\n     \n      Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard\n      the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound\n      them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell\n      twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\n     \n      After a year or two, it came to pass that the king\u2019s son rode through the\n      forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\n      charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\n      solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\u2019s\n      son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but\n      none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched\n      his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it.\n      Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress\n      came there, and he heard how she cried:\n     \n      Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed\n      up to her. \u2018If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my\n      fortune,\u2019 said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to\n      the tower and cried:\n     \n      Immediately the hair fell down and the king\u2019s son climbed up.\n     \n      At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had\n      never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\u2019s son began to talk to her\n      quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that\n      it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then\n      Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for\n      her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: \u2018He\n      will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\u2019; and she said yes, and laid\n      her hand in his. She said: \u2018I will willingly go away with you, but I do\n      not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that\n      you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will\n      descend, and you will take me on your horse.\u2019 They agreed that until that\n      time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.\n      The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her:\n      \u2018Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me\n      to draw up than the young king\u2019s son\u2014he is with me in a moment.\u2019\n      \u2018Ah! you wicked child,\u2019 cried the enchantress. \u2018What do I hear you say! I\n      thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived\n      me!\u2019 In her anger she clutched Rapunzel\u2019s beautiful tresses, wrapped them\n      twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and\n      snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.\n      And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where\n      she had to live in great grief and misery.\n     \n      On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\n      fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\n      window, and when the king\u2019s son came and cried:\n     \n      she let the hair down. The king\u2019s son ascended, but instead of finding his\n      dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked\n      and venomous looks. \u2018Aha!\u2019 she cried mockingly, \u2018you would fetch your\n      dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the\n      cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost\n      to you; you will never see her again.\u2019 The king\u2019s son was beside himself\n      with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped\n      with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he\n      wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries,\n      and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus\n      he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert\n      where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a\n      girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar\n      to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him\n      and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they\n      grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his\n      kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time\n      afterwards, happy and contented.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he\n      entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there.\n      He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at the top of\n      this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen asleep under\n      the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms, had\n      flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\n     \n      The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\n      \u2018You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.\u2019 He\n      took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\n      one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\n      had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\n      when they did not see each other they were sad.\n     \n      Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began\n      to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the\n      spring. Lina saw this and said, \u2018Listen, old Sanna, why are you fetching\n      so much water?\u2019 \u2018If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will tell you\n      why.\u2019 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the\n      cook said: \u2018Early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, I\n      will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, I will throw in\n      Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\u2019\n     \n      Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\n      was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel: \u2018If\n      you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said:\n      \u2018Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Then will I\n      tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the\n      house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I\n      would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning\n      when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw\n      you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and\n      go away together.\u2019\n     \n      The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\n      away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\n      bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\n      and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\n      alarmed, and she said to herself: \u2018What shall I say now when the forester\n      comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be followed\n      instantly to get them back again.\u2019\n     \n      Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and overtake\n      the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the forest, and\n      when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina said to\n      Fundevogel: \u2018Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said:\n      \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019 Then said Lina: \u2018Do you become a rose-tree, and I\n      the rose upon it.\u2019 When the three servants came to the forest, nothing was\n      there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but the children were nowhere.\n      Then said they: \u2018There is nothing to be done here,\u2019 and they went home and\n      told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little\n      rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the old cook scolded and said: \u2018You\n      simpletons, you should have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off\n      the rose and brought it home with you; go, and do it at once.\u2019 They had\n      therefore to go out and look for the second time. The children, however,\n      saw them coming from a distance. Then Lina said: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave\n      me, and I will never leave you.\u2019 Fundevogel said: \u2018Neither now; nor ever.\u2019\n      Said Lina: \u2018Then do you become a church, and I\u2019ll be the chandelier in\n      it.\u2019 So when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with\n      a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other: \u2018What can we do\n      here, let us go home.\u2019 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not\n      found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and\n      there was a chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: \u2018You\n      fools! why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier\n      home with you?\u2019 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went\n      with the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\n      saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\n      after them. Then said Lina: \u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never\n      leave you.\u2019 Then said Fundevogel: \u2018Neither now, nor ever.\u2019 Said Lina: \u2018Be\n      a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\u2019 The cook, however, came up to\n      them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink\n      it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her head in its beak and\n      drew her into the water, and there the old witch had to drown. Then the\n      children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have\n      not died, they are living still.\n    ",
        "\n      One summer\u2019s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\n      window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came a\n      peasant woman down the street crying: \u2018Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\n      cheap!\u2019 This rang pleasantly in the tailor\u2019s ears; he stretched his\n      delicate head out of the window, and called: \u2018Come up here, dear woman;\n      here you will get rid of your goods.\u2019 The woman came up the three steps to\n      the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for\n      him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at\n      length said: \u2018The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four ounces,\n      dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence.\u2019\n      The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but\n      went away quite angry and grumbling. \u2018Now, this jam shall be blessed by\n      God,\u2019 cried the little tailor, \u2018and give me health and strength\u2019; so he\n      brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across\n      the loaf and spread the jam over it. \u2018This won\u2019t taste bitter,\u2019 said he,\n      \u2018but I will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.\u2019 He laid the\n      bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches.\n      In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were\n      sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in\n      hosts. \u2018Hi! who invited you?\u2019 said the little tailor, and drove the\n      unbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German, would\n      not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing companies. The\n      little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from\n      the hole under his work-table, and saying: \u2018Wait, and I will give it to\n      you,\u2019 struck it mercilessly on them. When he drew it away and counted,\n      there lay before him no fewer than seven, dead and with legs stretched\n      out. \u2018Are you a fellow of that sort?\u2019 said he, and could not help admiring\n      his own bravery. \u2018The whole town shall know of this!\u2019 And the little\n      tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on\n      it in large letters: \u2018Seven at one stroke!\u2019 \u2018What, the town!\u2019 he\n      continued, \u2018the whole world shall hear of it!\u2019 and his heart wagged with\n      joy like a lamb\u2019s tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go\n      forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for\n      his valour. Before he went away, he sought about in the house to see if\n      there was anything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing\n      but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he\n      observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into\n      his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was\n      light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and\n      when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant\n      looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to\n      him, and said: \u2018Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking\n      the wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my\n      luck. Have you any inclination to go with me?\u2019 The giant looked\n      contemptuously at the tailor, and said: \u2018You ragamuffin! You miserable\n      creature!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Oh, indeed?\u2019 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\n      showed the giant the girdle, \u2018there may you read what kind of a man I am!\u2019\n      The giant read: \u2018Seven at one stroke,\u2019 and thought that they had been men\n      whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect for the\n      tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took a stone in\n      his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it. \u2018Do\n      that likewise,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018if you have strength.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019\n      said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play with us!\u2019 and put his hand into his\n      pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran\n      out of it. \u2018Faith,\u2019 said he, \u2018that was a little better, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 The\n      giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it of the little\n      man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye\n      could scarcely follow it. \u2018Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,\u2019\n      \u2018Well thrown,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018but after all the stone came down to\n      earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come back at all,\u2019 and\n      he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the\n      air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not\n      come back. \u2018How does that shot please you, comrade?\u2019 asked the tailor.\n      \u2018You can certainly throw,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018but now we will see if you are\n      able to carry anything properly.\u2019 He took the little tailor to a mighty\n      oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: \u2018If you are\n      strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.\u2019 \u2018Readily,\u2019\n      answered the little man; \u2018take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will\n      raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.\u2019 The\n      giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a\n      branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the\n      whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite\n      merry and happy, and whistled the song: \u2018Three tailors rode forth from the\n      gate,\u2019 as if carrying the tree were child\u2019s play. The giant, after he had\n      dragged the heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried:\n      \u2018Hark you, I shall have to let the tree fall!\u2019 The tailor sprang nimbly\n      down, seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and\n      said to the giant: \u2018You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\n      the tree!\u2019\n     \n      They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\n      hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\n      down, gave it into the tailor\u2019s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\n      tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\n      it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. When\n      he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \u2018What is this?\n      Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\u2019 \u2018There is no lack of\n      strength,\u2019 answered the little tailor. \u2018Do you think that could be\n      anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over the\n      tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket. Jump as\n      I did, if you can do it.\u2019 The giant made the attempt but he could not get\n      over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also\n      the tailor kept the upper hand.\n     \n      The giant said: \u2018If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\n      cavern and spend the night with us.\u2019 The little tailor was willing, and\n      followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\n      there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\n      was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \u2018It is much\n      more spacious here than in my workshop.\u2019 The giant showed him a bed, and\n      said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too big for\n      the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner.\n      When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was\n      lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the\n      bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for\n      good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had\n      quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them\n      quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified, they were afraid that\n      he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry.\n     \n      The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\n      After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\n      palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\n      Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\n      read on his girdle: \u2018Seven at one stroke.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said they, \u2018what does the\n      great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty lord.\u2019\n      They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their opinion that\n      if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful man who ought\n      on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and\n      he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military\n      service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper,\n      waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed\n      to him this proposal. \u2018For this very reason have I come here,\u2019 the tailor\n      replied, \u2018I am ready to enter the king\u2019s service.\u2019 He was therefore\n      honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned him.\n     \n      The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him\n      a thousand miles away. \u2018What is to be the end of this?\u2019 they said among\n      themselves. \u2018If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him, seven of us\n      will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him.\u2019 They came\n      therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to the king, and\n      begged for their dismissal. \u2018We are not prepared,\u2019 said they, \u2018to stay\n      with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\u2019 The king was sorry that for the\n      sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had\n      never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him\n      again. But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded\n      lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on\n      the royal throne. He thought about it for a long time, and at last found\n      good counsel. He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed\n      that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him. In a\n      forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with\n      their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach\n      them without putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor conquered\n      and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife,\n      and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should\n      go with him to assist him. \u2018That would indeed be a fine thing for a man\n      like me!\u2019 thought the little tailor. \u2018One is not offered a beautiful\n      princess and half a kingdom every day of one\u2019s life!\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he\n      replied, \u2018I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the help of\n      the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no\n      need to be afraid of two.\u2019\n     \n      The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When\n      he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers: \u2018Just\n      stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\u2019 Then he\n      bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a while he\n      perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and snored so that\n      the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not idle, gathered two\n      pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the tree. When he was\n      halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat just above the\n      sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one\n      of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he\n      awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \u2018Why are you knocking me?\u2019 \u2018You must\n      be dreaming,\u2019 said the other, \u2018I am not knocking you.\u2019 They laid\n      themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on\n      the second. \u2018What is the meaning of this?\u2019 cried the other \u2018Why are you\n      pelting me?\u2019 \u2018I am not pelting you,\u2019 answered the first, growling. They\n      disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter\n      rest, and their eyes closed once more. The little tailor began his game\n      again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on\n      the breast of the first giant. \u2018That is too bad!\u2019 cried he, and sprang up\n      like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.\n      The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage\n      that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last\n      they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the little\n      tailor leapt down. \u2018It is a lucky thing,\u2019 said he, \u2018that they did not tear\n      up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to\n      another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\u2019 He drew out his sword\n      and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out\n      to the horsemen and said: \u2018The work is done; I have finished both of them\n      off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\n      defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\n      like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\u2019 \u2018But are you not\n      wounded?\u2019 asked the horsemen. \u2018You need not concern yourself about that,\u2019\n      answered the tailor, \u2018they have not bent one hair of mine.\u2019 The horsemen\n      would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the\n      giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees.\n     \n      The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\n      repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid\n      of the hero. \u2018Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my kingdom,\u2019\n      said he to him, \u2018you must perform one more heroic deed. In the forest\n      roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch it first.\u2019 \u2018I\n      fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one blow, is my kind\n      of affair.\u2019 He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the\n      forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside. He\n      had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed\n      directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more\n      ado. \u2018Softly, softly; it can\u2019t be done as quickly as that,\u2019 said he, and\n      stood still and waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang\n      nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its\n      strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the\n      strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. \u2018Now, I have\n      got the bird,\u2019 said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put\n      the rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of\n      the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the\n      king.\n     \n      The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\n      demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\n      made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\n      help. \u2018Willingly,\u2019 said the tailor, \u2018that is child\u2019s play!\u2019 He did not\n      take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\n      that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such\n      a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When the\n      boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted\n      tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and\n      sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in\n      one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round\n      outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was\n      much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught. The\n      little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner\n      with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to the king, who was now,\n      whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his\n      daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no warlike\n      hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone\n      to his heart still more than it did. The wedding was held with great\n      magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made.\n     \n      After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\n      night: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I will\n      rap the yard-measure over your ears.\u2019 Then she discovered in what state of\n      life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her\n      wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her\n      husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her and\n      said: \u2018Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall\n      stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and\n      take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world.\u2019 The\n      woman was satisfied with this; but the king\u2019s armour-bearer, who had heard\n      all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot.\n      \u2018I\u2019ll put a screw into that business,\u2019 said the little tailor. At night he\n      went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he\n      had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again.\n      The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out\n      in a clear voice: \u2018Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons,\n      or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears. I smote seven at one blow.\n      I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar,\n      and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.\u2019 When these men\n      heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and\n      ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would\n      venture anything further against him. So the little tailor was and\n      remained a king to the end of his life.\n    ",
        "\n      Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two\n      children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had little to\n      bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could\n      no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night\n      in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his\n      wife: \u2018What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, when\n      we no longer have anything even for ourselves?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what,\n      husband,\u2019 answered the woman, \u2018early tomorrow morning we will take the\n      children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will\n      light a fire for them, and give each of them one more piece of bread, and\n      then we will go to our work and leave them alone. They will not find the\n      way home again, and we shall be rid of them.\u2019 \u2018No, wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018I\n      will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?\u2014the\n      wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.\u2019 \u2018O, you fool!\u2019 said\n      she, \u2018then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the\n      planks for our coffins,\u2019 and she left him no peace until he consented.\n      \u2018But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,\u2019 said the man.\n     \n      The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard\n      what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept bitter tears,\n      and said to Hansel: \u2018Now all is over with us.\u2019 \u2018Be quiet, Gretel,\u2019 said\n      Hansel, \u2018do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way to help us.\u2019 And\n      when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat,\n      opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon shone brightly, and the\n      white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver\n      pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as\n      many as he could get in. Then he went back and said to Gretel: \u2018Be\n      comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake\n      us,\u2019 and he lay down again in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun\n      had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying: \u2018Get up, you\n      sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.\u2019 She gave each a\n      little piece of bread, and said: \u2018There is something for your dinner, but\n      do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.\u2019 Gretel took\n      the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then\n      they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had walked a\n      short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so\n      again and again. His father said: \u2018Hansel, what are you looking at there\n      and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your\n      legs.\u2019 \u2018Ah, father,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I am looking at my little white cat,\n      which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\u2019 The wife\n      said: \u2018Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\n      shining on the chimneys.\u2019 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\n      the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\n      out of his pocket on the road.\n     \n      When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \u2018Now,\n      children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be\n      cold.\u2019 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little\n      hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very\n      high, the woman said: \u2018Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and\n      rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we\n      will come back and fetch you away.\u2019\n     \n      Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\n      piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\n      believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a\n      branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing\n      backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time,\n      their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last\n      they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said: \u2018How\n      are we to get out of the forest now?\u2019 But Hansel comforted her and said:\n      \u2018Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find\n      the way.\u2019 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister\n      by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver\n      pieces, and showed them the way.\n     \n      They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to\n      their father\u2019s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened\n      it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \u2018You naughty children,\n      why have you slept so long in the forest?\u2014we thought you were never\n      coming back at all!\u2019 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to\n      the heart to leave them behind alone.\n     \n      Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the land,\n      and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father:\n      \u2018Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that is the\n      end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so\n      that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of\n      saving ourselves!\u2019 The man\u2019s heart was heavy, and he thought: \u2018It would be\n      better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.\u2019 The woman,\n      however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and\n      reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded\n      the first time, he had to do so a second time also.\n     \n      The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\n      When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out\n      and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the\n      door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little\n      sister, and said: \u2018Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God\n      will help us.\u2019\n     \n      Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\n      beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\n      than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in\n      his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\n      \u2018Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\u2019 said the father, \u2018go on.\u2019 \u2018I am\n      looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants\n      to say goodbye to me,\u2019 answered Hansel. \u2018Fool!\u2019 said the woman, \u2018that is\n      not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the\n      chimney.\u2019 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the\n      path.\n     \n      The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\n      never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\n      the mother said: \u2018Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you\n      may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the\n      evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\u2019 When it was\n      noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his\n      by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to\n      the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel\n      comforted his little sister and said: \u2018Just wait, Gretel, until the moon\n      rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn\n      about, they will show us our way home again.\u2019 When the moon came they set\n      out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly\n      about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to\n      Gretel: \u2018We shall soon find the way,\u2019 but they did not find it. They\n      walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening,\n      but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had\n      nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as\n      they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay\n      down beneath a tree and fell asleep.\n     \n      It was now three mornings since they had left their father\u2019s house. They\n      began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\n      help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it was\n      mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which\n      sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And when\n      its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they\n      followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it\n      alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was\n      built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear\n      sugar. \u2018We will set to work on that,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018and have a good meal.\n      I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window,\n      it will taste sweet.\u2019 Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of\n      the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and\n      nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:\n     \n      The children answered:\n     \n      and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\n      taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\n      the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.\n      Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who supported\n      herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly\n      frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman,\n      however, nodded her head, and said: \u2018Oh, you dear children, who has\n      brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No harm shall happen to\n      you.\u2019 She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.\n      Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples,\n      and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white\n      linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in\n      heaven.\n     \n      The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a\n      wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little\n      house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell into her\n      power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with\n      her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent\n      like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near. When Hansel\n      and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said\n      mockingly: \u2018I have them, they shall not escape me again!\u2019 Early in the\n      morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she\n      saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy\n      cheeks she muttered to herself: \u2018That will be a dainty mouthful!\u2019 Then she\n      seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable,\n      and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not\n      help him. Then she went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried:\n      \u2018Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your\n      brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is\n      fat, I will eat him.\u2019 Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in\n      vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\n     \n      And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\n      but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\n      cried: \u2018Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\n      be fat.\u2019 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old\n      woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel\u2019s\n      finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him. When\n      four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized\n      with impatience and would not wait any longer. \u2018Now, then, Gretel,\u2019 she\n      cried to the girl, \u2018stir yourself, and bring some water. Let Hansel be fat\n      or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.\u2019 Ah, how the poor little\n      sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did\n      flow down her cheeks! \u2018Dear God, do help us,\u2019 she cried. \u2018If the wild\n      beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died\n      together.\u2019 \u2018Just keep your noise to yourself,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018it\n      won\u2019t help you at all.\u2019\n     \n      Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\n      the water, and light the fire. \u2018We will bake first,\u2019 said the old woman,\n      \u2018I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\u2019 She pushed poor\n      Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\n      \u2018Creep in,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018and see if it is properly heated, so that we\n      can put the bread in.\u2019 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut\n      the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But\n      Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \u2018I do not know how I am to do\n      it; how do I get in?\u2019 \u2018Silly goose,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018The door is big\n      enough; just look, I can get in myself!\u2019 and she crept up and thrust her\n      head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into\n      it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to\n      howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was\n      miserably burnt to death.\n     \n      Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\n      and cried: \u2018Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\u2019 Then Hansel\n      sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\n      rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\n      as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch\u2019s\n      house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\n      \u2018These are far better than pebbles!\u2019 said Hansel, and thrust into his\n      pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: \u2018I, too, will take\n      something home with me,\u2019 and filled her pinafore full. \u2018But now we must be\n      off,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018that we may get out of the witch\u2019s forest.\u2019\n     \n      When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of water.\n      \u2018We cannot cross,\u2019 said Hansel, \u2018I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.\u2019 \u2018And\n      there is also no ferry,\u2019 answered Gretel, \u2018but a white duck is swimming\n      there: if I ask her, she will help us over.\u2019 Then she cried:\n     \n      The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his\n      sister to sit by him. \u2018No,\u2019 replied Gretel, \u2018that will be too heavy for\n      the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\u2019 The good\n      little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked\n      for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them,\n      and at length they saw from afar their father\u2019s house. Then they began to\n      run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father\u2019s\n      neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children\n      in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore\n      until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one\n      handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety\n      was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is\n      done, there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur\n      cap out of it.\n    ",
        "\n      Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into partnership\n      and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in\n      great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to\n      their stores. The bird\u2019s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in\n      fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw to the cooking.\n     \n      When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new.\n      And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a fellow\n      bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household\n      arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor\n      simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home\n      and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire and\n      fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until\n      it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the pot to see\n      that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he\n      just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the\n      vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted,\n      and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside\n      his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal,\n      they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was\n      really a very delightful life.\n     \n      Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the\n      wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and\n      had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\n      change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as\n      the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\n      master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\n      drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\n      to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\n     \n      And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\n      made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\n      till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\n      sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew\n      out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog\n      who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and\n      so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this\n      bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog\n      answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the\n      reason his life had been forfeited.\n     \n      He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had\n      seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best\n      of things and to remain with one another.\n     \n      So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\n      wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\n      out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot;\n      but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already\n      parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\n     \n      Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could\n      nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and\n      there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found.\n      Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire\n      and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water, but his pail\n      fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover\n      himself, he was drowned.\n    ",
        "\n      Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was\n      beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother, however,\n      loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so\n      the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of\n      the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. Her stepmother sent\n      her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until\n      she made her fingers bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on\n      to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the\n      spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran\n      home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to\n      her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, \u2018As you have\n      let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\u2019\n     \n      The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her\n      distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\n     \n      She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\n      beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in\n      every direction.\n     \n      She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker\u2019s oven\n      full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, \u2018Take us out, take us out,\n      or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.\u2019\n      So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\n     \n      She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\n      \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray,\u2019 cried the tree; \u2018my apples, one and all, are\n      ripe.\u2019 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her\n      like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple\n      left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap\n      and walked on again.\n     \n      The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\n      woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\n      turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, \u2018What are you\n      afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\n      properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\n      however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\n      it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\n      in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.\u2019 The old woman\n      spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\n      into her service.\n     \n      She took care to do everything according to the old woman\u2019s bidding and\n      every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\n      feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good as\n      her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and boiled\n      meats every day.\n     \n      So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to\n      grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became\n      conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was\n      homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle\n      than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went to Mother\n      Holle and said, \u2018I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer,\n      for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.\u2019\n     \n      Then Mother Holle said, \u2018I am pleased that you should want to go back to\n      your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will\n      take you home myself.\u2019\n     \n      Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate was\n      opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon her,\n      and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from head to\n      foot.\n     \n      \u2018That is a reward for your industry,\u2019 said Mother Holle, and as she spoke\n      she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\n     \n      The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old world\n      close to her mother\u2019s house. As she entered the courtyard, the cock who\n      was perched on the well, called out:\n     \n      Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\n      covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them all\n      that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great\n      riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try\n      her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin, and\n      the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn-bush, so that\n      she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the\n      well, and jumped in herself.\n     \n      Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till\n      she came to the oven. \u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be\n      burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\u2019 cried the loaves as\n      before. But the lazy girl answered, \u2018Do you think I am going to dirty my\n      hands for you?\u2019 and walked on.\n     \n      Presently she came to the apple-tree. \u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\n      apples, one and all, are ripe,\u2019 it cried. But she only answered, \u2018A nice\n      thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\u2019 and\n      passed on.\n     \n      At last she came to Mother Holle\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about\n      the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\n      herself without delay to the old woman.\n     \n      The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\n      to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\n      return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the\n      third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the\n      mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to make the old\n      woman\u2019s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might\n      fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she\n      might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself,\n      \u2018The gold will soon be mine.\u2019 Mother Holle led her, as she had led her\n      sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of\n      the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her.\n     \n      \u2018That is in return for your services,\u2019 said the old woman, and she shut\n      the gate.\n     \n      So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\n      well called out as she saw her:\n     \n      But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\n      her as long as she lived.\n    ",
        "\n      Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\n      who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\n      nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\n      little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\n      wear anything else; so she was always called \u2018Little Red-Cap.\u2019\n     \n      One day her mother said to her: \u2018Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of\n      cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and\n      weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you\n      are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may\n      fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and\n      when you go into her room, don\u2019t forget to say, \u201cGood morning\u201d, and don\u2019t\n      peep into every corner before you do it.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018I will take great care,\u2019 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her\n      hand on it.\n     \n      The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and\n      just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not\n      know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n     \n      \u2018Good day, Little Red-Cap,\u2019 said he.\n     \n      \u2018Thank you kindly, wolf.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018To my grandmother\u2019s.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018What have you got in your apron?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\n      have something good, to make her stronger.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under\n      the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must\n      know it,\u2019 replied Little Red-Cap.\n     \n      The wolf thought to himself: \u2018What a tender young creature! what a nice\n      plump mouthful\u2014she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\n      act craftily, so as to catch both.\u2019 So he walked for a short time by the\n      side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: \u2018See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty\n      the flowers are about here\u2014why do you not look round? I believe,\n      too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\n      walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\n      out here in the wood is merry.\u2019\n     \n      Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here\n      and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she\n      thought: \u2018Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please\n      her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good\n      time\u2019; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And\n      whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one\n      farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n     \n      Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\u2019s house and knocked at\n      the door.\n     \n      \u2018Who is there?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Little Red-Cap,\u2019 replied the wolf. \u2018She is bringing cake and wine; open\n      the door.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Lift the latch,\u2019 called out the grandmother, \u2018I am too weak, and cannot\n      get up.\u2019\n     \n      The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word\n      he went straight to the grandmother\u2019s bed, and devoured her. Then he put\n      on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew\n      the curtains.\n     \n      Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when\n      she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her\n      grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n     \n      She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\n      went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\n      herself: \u2018Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\n      being with grandmother so much.\u2019 She called out: \u2018Good morning,\u2019 but\n      received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\n      There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\n      looking very strange.\n     \n      \u2018Oh! grandmother,\u2019 she said, \u2018what big ears you have!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018The better to hear you with, my child,\u2019 was the reply.\n     \n      \u2018But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\u2019 she said.\n     \n      \u2018The better to see you with, my dear.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018The better to hug you with.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018The better to eat you with!\u2019\n     \n      And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed\n      and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n     \n      When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\n      fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\n      the house, and thought to himself: \u2018How the old woman is snoring! I must\n      just see if she wants anything.\u2019 So he went into the room, and when he\n      came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \u2018Do I find you\n      here, you old sinner!\u2019 said he. \u2018I have long sought you!\u2019 Then just as he\n      was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\n      devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not\n      fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of\n      the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap\n      shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out,\n      crying: \u2018Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf\u2019;\n      and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able\n      to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they\n      filled the wolf\u2019s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the\n      stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n     \n      Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\u2019s skin and\n      went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\n      Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \u2018As long\n      as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood,\n      when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\u2019\n     \n      It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\n      grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\n      path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her\n      way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had\n      said \u2018good morning\u2019 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that\n      if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have\n      eaten her up. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the grandmother, \u2018we will shut the door, that\n      he may not come in.\u2019 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: \u2018Open\n      the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some\n      cakes.\u2019 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole\n      twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending\n      to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after\n      her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in\n      his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said\n      to the child: \u2018Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so\n      carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.\u2019 Red-Cap carried\n      until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages\n      reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched\n      out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to\n      slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and\n      was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything\n      to harm her again.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\n      grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for.\n      He said to himself, \u2018I will give her to the first suitable man who comes\n      and asks for her hand.\u2019 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as he\n      appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\n      which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\n      not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\n      She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\n      nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \u2018You\n      have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\n      time.\u2019 \u2018I do not know where your house is,\u2019 she answered. \u2018My house is out\n      there in the dark forest,\u2019 he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying\n      that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed only\n      replied, \u2018You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already invited\n      guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I will strew\n      ashes along the path.\u2019\n     \n      When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\n      dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be\n      able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils\n      to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the entrance to\n      the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed,\n      throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. She\n      walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the\n      forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so grim and mysterious, that\n      it did not please her at all. She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be\n      seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\n     \n      The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\n      cage on the wall. Again it cried:\n     \n      The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\n      all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar, and\n      there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\n      shaking. \u2018Can you tell me,\u2019 asked the girl, \u2018if my betrothed husband lives\n      here?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Ah, you poor child,\u2019 answered the old woman, \u2018what a place for you to\n      come to! This is a murderers\u2019 den. You think yourself a promised bride,\n      and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you\n      will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron of\n      water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in\n      their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat you, for\n      they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save you, you\n      would be lost.\u2019\n     \n      Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\n      from view. \u2018Keep as still as a mouse,\u2019 she said; \u2018do not move or speak, or\n      it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are all asleep, we\n      will flee together. I have long been waiting for an opportunity to\n      escape.\u2019\n     \n      The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\n      dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and paid\n      no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink, three\n      glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with\n      that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her dainty\n      clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and\n      sprinkled salt upon it.\n     \n      The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask,\n      for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers.\n      One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger\n      of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a\n      hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and\n      fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. The\n      robber took a light and began looking for it, but he could not find it.\n      \u2018Have you looked behind the large cask?\u2019 said one of the others. But the\n      old woman called out, \u2018Come and eat your suppers, and let the thing be\n      till tomorrow; the finger won\u2019t run away.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018The old woman is right,\u2019 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\n      the finger and sat down.\n     \n      The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\n      long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\n      snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the\n      cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were\n      lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread\n      lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she passed safely\n      over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs, opened the door,\n      and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers\u2019 den. They found the\n      ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and\n      grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along\n      the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before they\n      reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened.\n     \n      The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom arrived\n      and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken care to\n      invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast, each guest\n      in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a\n      word.\n     \n      \u2018And you, my love,\u2019 said the bridegroom, turning to her, \u2018is there no tale\n      you know? Tell us something.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018I will tell you a dream, then,\u2019 said the bride. \u2018I went alone through a\n      forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but a\n      bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\n     \n      And again a second time it said these words.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\n      and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\n      cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head\n      still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered, \u201cAh, you\n      poor child, you are come to a murderers\u2019 den; your betrothed does indeed\n      live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat\n      you.\u201d\u2019\n     \n      \u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this\n      when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them.\n      They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and\n      with that she died.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\n      pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\n      finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut off\n      her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great\n      cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.\u2019 And with these\n      words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the assembled\n      guests.\n     \n      The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\n      tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\n      delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\n      condemned to death for their wicked deeds.\n    ",
        "\n      A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\n      fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. \u2018How lonely it is,\n      wife,\u2019 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, \u2018for you and me to\n      sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us\n      while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!\u2019 \u2018What you\n      say is very true,\u2019 said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel;\n      \u2018how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were ever so small\u2014nay,\n      if it were no bigger than my thumb\u2014I should be very happy, and love\n      it dearly.\u2019 Now\u2014odd as you may think it\u2014it came to pass that\n      this good woman\u2019s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished\n      it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy\n      and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, \u2018Well, we\n      cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we\n      will love him dearly.\u2019 And they called him Thomas Thumb.\n     \n      They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\n      bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\n      Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be\n      a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\n     \n      One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel,\n      he said, \u2018I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I want to\n      make haste.\u2019 \u2018Oh, father,\u2019 cried Tom, \u2018I will take care of that; the cart\n      shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\u2019 Then the woodman laughed,\n      and said, \u2018How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\u2019s bridle.\u2019\n      \u2018Never mind that, father,\u2019 said Tom; \u2018if my mother will only harness the\n      horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to go.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said\n      the father, \u2018we will try for once.\u2019\n     \n      When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom\n      into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go,\n      crying out, \u2018Go on!\u2019 and \u2018Stop!\u2019 as he wanted: and thus the horse went on\n      just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It\n      happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom was\n      calling out, \u2018Gently! gently!\u2019 two strangers came up. \u2018What an odd thing\n      that is!\u2019 said one: \u2018there is a cart going along, and I hear a carter\n      talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.\u2019 \u2018That is queer, indeed,\u2019\n      said the other; \u2018let us follow the cart, and see where it goes.\u2019 So they\n      went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the\n      woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried out, \u2018See, father,\n      here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take me down!\u2019 So his\n      father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his\n      son out of the horse\u2019s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as\n      merry as you please.\n     \n      The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what to\n      say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, \u2018That little\n      urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from\n      town to town as a show; we must buy him.\u2019 So they went up to the woodman,\n      and asked him what he would take for the little man. \u2018He will be better\n      off,\u2019 said they, \u2018with us than with you.\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t sell him at all,\u2019 said\n      the father; \u2018my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver\n      and gold in the world.\u2019 But Tom, hearing of the bargain they wanted to\n      make, crept up his father\u2019s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear,\n      \u2018Take the money, father, and let them have me; I\u2019ll soon come back to\n      you.\u2019\n     \n      So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a large\n      piece of gold, and they paid the price. \u2018Where would you like to sit?\u2019\n      said one of them. \u2018Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice\n      gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we go\n      along.\u2019 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\n      father they took him away with them.\n     \n      They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man said,\n      \u2018Let me get down, I\u2019m tired.\u2019 So the man took off his hat, and put him\n      down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the road. But\n      Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into an old\n      mouse-hole. \u2018Good night, my masters!\u2019 said he, \u2018I\u2019m off! mind and look\n      sharp after me the next time.\u2019 Then they ran at once to the place, and\n      poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Tom\n      only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark, so\n      that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as sulky as\n      could be.\n     \n      When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. \u2018What\n      dangerous walking it is,\u2019 said he, \u2018in this ploughed field! If I were to\n      fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.\u2019\n      At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. \u2018This is\n      lucky,\u2019 said he, \u2018I can sleep here very well\u2019; and in he crept.\n     \n      Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\n      together; and one said to the other, \u2018How can we rob that rich parson\u2019s\n      house of his silver and gold?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you!\u2019 cried Tom. \u2018What noise was\n      that?\u2019 said the thief, frightened; \u2018I\u2019m sure I heard someone speak.\u2019 They\n      stood still listening, and Tom said, \u2018Take me with you, and I\u2019ll soon show\n      you how to get the parson\u2019s money.\u2019 \u2018But where are you?\u2019 said they. \u2018Look\n      about on the ground,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and listen where the sound comes\n      from.\u2019 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their\n      hands. \u2018You little urchin!\u2019 they said, \u2018what can you do for us?\u2019 \u2018Why, I\n      can get between the iron window-bars of the parson\u2019s house, and throw you\n      out whatever you want.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a good thought,\u2019 said the thieves; \u2018come\n      along, we shall see what you can do.\u2019\n     \n      When they came to the parson\u2019s house, Tom slipped through the window-bars\n      into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl, \u2018Will you\n      have all that is here?\u2019 At this the thieves were frightened, and said,\n      \u2018Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\u2019 But Tom\n      seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, \u2018How much\n      will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\u2019 Now the cook lay in the next\n      room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened.\n      Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little way; but at\n      last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \u2018The little urchin is only\n      trying to make fools of us.\u2019 So they came back and whispered softly to\n      him, saying, \u2018Now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us\n      out some of the money.\u2019 Then Tom called out as loud as he could, \u2018Very\n      well! hold your hands! here it comes.\u2019\n     \n      The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to open\n      the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the\n      maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the\n      time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when she had\n      looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found nobody, she\n      went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her eyes open.\n     \n      The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\n      place to finish his night\u2019s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to\n      sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother.\n      But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows happen to\n      us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the\n      cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of\n      hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. He still,\n      however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of\n      the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow\u2019s rick, and the cow had\n      taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. \u2018Good lack-a-day!\u2019 said he, \u2018how came I\n      to tumble into the mill?\u2019 But he soon found out where he really was; and\n      was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between\n      the cow\u2019s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went into her\n      stomach. \u2018It is rather dark,\u2019 said he; \u2018they forgot to build windows in\n      this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.\u2019\n     \n      Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\n      all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\n      down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\n      cried out as loud as he could, \u2018Don\u2019t bring me any more hay! Don\u2019t bring\n      me any more hay!\u2019\n     \n      The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\n      speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\n      that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\n      her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself up\n      out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\n      parson, and said, \u2018Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\u2019 But the parson said,\n      \u2018Woman, thou art surely mad!\u2019 However, he went with her into the\n      cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\n     \n      Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, \u2018Don\u2019t\n      bring me any more hay!\u2019 Then the parson himself was frightened; and\n      thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\n      spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\n      lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\n     \n      Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy task;\n      but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh ill-luck\n      befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach,\n      with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\n     \n      Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not\n      dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called out,\n      \u2018My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019s that?\u2019 said the\n      wolf. \u2018In such and such a house,\u2019 said Tom, describing his own father\u2019s\n      house. \u2018You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the\n      pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig,\n      apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can wish.\u2019\n     \n      The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the\n      house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the\n      pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart\u2019s content. As soon as he had\n      had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that he could\n      not go out by the same way he came in.\n     \n      This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\n      great shout, making all the noise he could. \u2018Will you be easy?\u2019 said the\n      wolf; \u2018you\u2019ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.\u2019\n      \u2018What\u2019s that to me?\u2019 said the little man; \u2018you have had your frolic, now\n      I\u2019ve a mind to be merry myself\u2019; and he began, singing and shouting as\n      loud as he could.\n     \n      The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a\n      crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\n      suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe,\n      and gave his wife a scythe. \u2018Do you stay behind,\u2019 said the woodman, \u2018and\n      when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe.\u2019\n      Tom heard all this, and cried out, \u2018Father, father! I am here, the wolf\n      has swallowed me.\u2019 And his father said, \u2018Heaven be praised! we have found\n      our dear child again\u2019; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear\n      she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on\n      the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open\n      his body, and set Tommy free. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the father, \u2018what fears we have\n      had for you!\u2019 \u2018Yes, father,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have travelled all over the\n      world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very\n      glad to come home and get fresh air again.\u2019 \u2018Why, where have you been?\u2019\n      said his father. \u2018I have been in a mouse-hole\u2014and in a snail-shell\u2014and\n      down a cow\u2019s throat\u2014and in the wolf\u2019s belly; and yet here I am\n      again, safe and sound.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Well,\u2019 said they, \u2018you are come back, and we will not sell you again for\n      all the riches in the world.\u2019\n     \n      Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to\n      eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes\n      for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey. So Master\n      Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he\n      had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things,\n      and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that,\n      after all, there\u2019s no place like HOME!\n    ",
        "\n      By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream of\n      water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller\u2019s house was\n      close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\n      She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud of\n      her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt\n      in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now this king\n      was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller\u2019s boast his\n      greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him.\n      Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of\n      straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, \u2018All this must be spun\n      into gold before morning, as you love your life.\u2019 It was in vain that the\n      poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that\n      she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was\n      locked, and she was left alone.\n     \n      She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate;\n      when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled\n      in, and said, \u2018Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping\n      for?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she, \u2018I must spin this straw into gold, and I know not\n      how.\u2019 \u2018What will you give me,\u2019 said the hobgoblin, \u2018to do it for you?\u2019 \u2018My\n      necklace,\u2019 replied the maiden. He took her at her word, and sat himself\n      down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\n     \n      And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the\n      straw was all spun into gold.\n     \n      When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\n      but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\n      miller\u2019s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\n      and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\n      said, \u2018What will you give me to do your task?\u2019 \u2018The ring on my finger,\u2019\n      said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\n      wheel again, and whistled and sang:\n     \n      till, long before morning, all was done again.\n     \n      The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but\n      still he had not enough: so he took the miller\u2019s daughter to a yet larger\n      heap, and said, \u2018All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be\n      my queen.\u2019 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and said, \u2018What\n      will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?\u2019 \u2018I have nothing\n      left,\u2019 said she. \u2018Then say you will give me,\u2019 said the little man, \u2018the\n      first little child that you may have when you are queen.\u2019 \u2018That may never\n      be,\u2019 thought the miller\u2019s daughter: and as she knew no other way to get\n      her task done, she said she would do what he asked. Round went the wheel\n      again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold.\n      The king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to\n      keep his word; so he married the miller\u2019s daughter, and she really became\n      queen.\n     \n      At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\n      dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where she\n      was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then she\n      grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the\n      wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last\n      her tears softened him, and he said, \u2018I will give you three days\u2019 grace,\n      and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child.\u2019\n     \n      Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that she\n      had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find out new\n      ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with TIMOTHY,\n      ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could remember; but to\n      all and each of them he said, \u2018Madam, that is not my name.\u2019\n     \n      The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\n      BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\n      still said to every one of them, \u2018Madam, that is not my name.\u2019\n     \n      The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, \u2018I have travelled\n      two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as I was\n      climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox and the\n      hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before the hut\n      burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was dancing\n      upon one leg, and singing:\n     \n      When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\n      friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\n      to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\n      arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\n      to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with him\n      to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, \u2018Now, lady, what is my name?\u2019\n      \u2018Is it JOHN?\u2019 asked she. \u2018No, madam!\u2019 \u2018Is it TOM?\u2019 \u2018No, madam!\u2019 \u2018Is it\n      JEMMY?\u2019 \u2018It is not.\u2019 \u2018Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?\u2019 said the lady\n      slyly. \u2018Some witch told you that!\u2014some witch told you that!\u2019 cried\n      the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\n      floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\n      out.\n     \n      Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby\n      crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for\n      nothing, and said, \u2018We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr\n      RUMPLESTILTSKIN!\u2019\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\n      when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\n      was quite happy and thought: \u2018You certainly are a pretty girl!\u2019 And when\n      she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and\n      as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was\n      cooking until she was satisfied, and said: \u2018The cook must know what the\n      food is like.\u2019\n     \n      It came to pass that the master one day said to her: \u2018Gretel, there is a\n      guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\u2019 \u2018I will\n      see to it, master,\u2019 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\n      plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\n      the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\n      nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out to\n      her master: \u2018If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from\n      the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the\n      moment they are at their juiciest.\u2019 The master said: \u2018I will run myself,\n      and fetch the guest.\u2019 When the master had turned his back, Gretel laid the\n      spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \u2018Standing so long by the\n      fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come?\n      Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.\u2019 She ran down,\n      set a jug, said: \u2018God bless it for you, Gretel,\u2019 and took a good drink,\n      and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and\n      took yet another hearty draught.\n     \n      Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and\n      drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good, Gretel\n      thought: \u2018Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\u2019 She touched it\n      with her finger, and said: \u2018Ah! how good fowls are! It certainly is a sin\n      and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!\u2019 She ran to the\n      window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no\n      one, and went back to the fowls and thought: \u2018One of the wings is burning!\n      I had better take it off and eat it.\u2019 So she cut it off, ate it, and\n      enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: \u2018The other must go down\n      too, or else master will observe that something is missing.\u2019 When the two\n      wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him.\n      It suddenly occurred to her: \u2018Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at\n      all, and have turned in somewhere.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Well, Gretel, enjoy\n      yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up\n      entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God\u2019s good\n      gifts be spoilt?\u2019 So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink\n      and ate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was\n      swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the\n      other and said: \u2018What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go\n      together; what\u2019s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I\n      were to take another draught it would do me no harm.\u2019 So she took another\n      hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\n     \n      While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \u2018Hurry up,\n      Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, I will soon\n      serve up,\u2019 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that the\n      table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going\n      to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently the guest\n      came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door. Gretel ran,\n      and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her\n      finger to her lips and said: \u2018Hush! hush! go away as quickly as you can,\n      if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did\n      ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears. Just\n      listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\u2019 The guest heard the\n      sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Gretel\n      was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: \u2018You have\n      invited a fine guest!\u2019 \u2018Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019\n      said she, \u2018he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up,\n      off the dish, and has run away with them!\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a nice trick!\u2019 said her\n      master, and lamented the fine chickens. \u2018If he had but left me one, so\n      that something remained for me to eat.\u2019 He called to him to stop, but the\n      guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife still in\n      his hand, crying: \u2018Just one, just one,\u2019 meaning that the guest should\n      leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest, however, thought\n      no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if\n      fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of\n      hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold\n      the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of\n      his mouth. His son and his son\u2019s wife were disgusted at this, so the old\n      grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they\n      gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And\n      he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. Once, too,\n      his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and\n      broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed.\n      Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he\n      had to eat.\n     \n      They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\n      began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \u2018What are you\n      doing there?\u2019 asked the father. \u2018I am making a little trough,\u2019 answered\n      the child, \u2018for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\u2019\n     \n      The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began\n      to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth\n      always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a\n      little of anything.\n    ",
        "\n      There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants,\n      and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not\n      even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his\n      wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her: \u2018Listen, I have a\n      good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden\n      calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it\n      will certainly get big and be a cow.\u2019 the woman also liked the idea, and\n      their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it\n      ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.\n     \n      Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\n      called the cow-herd in and said: \u2018Look, I have a little calf there, but it\n      is still small and has to be carried.\u2019 The cow-herd said: \u2018All right,\u2019 and\n      took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the\n      grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating,\n      and the cow-herd said: \u2018It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats\n      already!\u2019 At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said\n      to the calf: \u2018If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on\n      your four legs; I don\u2019t care to drag you home again in my arms.\u2019 But the\n      little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when\n      the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing,\n      he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered: \u2018It is still standing out\n      there eating. It would not stop and come with us.\u2019 But the little peasant\n      said: \u2018Oh, but I must have my beast back again.\u2019 Then they went back to\n      the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The\n      cow-herd said: \u2018It must have run away.\u2019 The peasant, however, said: \u2018Don\u2019t\n      tell me that,\u2019 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his\n      carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which\n      had run away.\n     \n      And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so\n      long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and\n      could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the\n      flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin\n      there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he\n      passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity\n      he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad\n      and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned\n      back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller\u2019s wife was alone in\n      the house, and said to the peasant: \u2018Lay yourself on the straw there,\u2019 and\n      gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down\n      with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: \u2018He is tired and has gone\n      to sleep.\u2019 In the meantime came the parson; the miller\u2019s wife received him\n      well, and said: \u2018My husband is out, so we will have a feast.\u2019 The peasant\n      listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he\n      had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the\n      woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\n     \n      Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside.\n      The woman said: \u2018Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\u2019 she quickly hid the roast\n      meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the\n      bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then\n      she opened the door for her husband, and said: \u2018Thank heaven, you are back\n      again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an\n      end.\u2019 The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, \u2018What is\n      that fellow doing there?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the wife, \u2018the poor knave came in the\n      storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and\n      cheese, and showed him where the straw was.\u2019 The man said: \u2018I have no\n      objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.\u2019 The woman said: \u2018But\n      I have nothing but bread and cheese.\u2019 \u2018I am contented with anything,\u2019\n      replied the husband, \u2018so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\u2019\n      and looked at the peasant and said: \u2018Come and eat some more with me.\u2019 The\n      peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After\n      this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground,\n      and asked: \u2018What have you there?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018I have a\n      soothsayer inside it.\u2019 \u2018Can he foretell anything to me?\u2019 said the miller.\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 answered the peasant: \u2018but he only says four things, and the\n      fifth he keeps to himself.\u2019 The miller was curious, and said: \u2018Let him\n      foretell something for once.\u2019 Then the peasant pinched the raven\u2019s head,\n      so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \u2018What\n      did he say?\u2019 The peasant answered: \u2018In the first place, he says that there\n      is some wine hidden under the pillow.\u2019 \u2018Bless me!\u2019 cried the miller, and\n      went there and found the wine. \u2018Now go on,\u2019 said he. The peasant made the\n      raven croak again, and said: \u2018In the second place, he says that there is\n      some roast meat in the tiled stove.\u2019 \u2018Upon my word!\u2019 cried the miller, and\n      went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\n      prophesy still more, and said: \u2018Thirdly, he says that there is some salad\n      on the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and went\n      there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more\n      till he croaked, and said: \u2018Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes\n      under the bed.\u2019 \u2018That would be a fine thing!\u2019 cried the miller, and looked\n      there, and found the cakes.\n     \n      And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\u2019s wife was\n      frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The\n      miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant\n      said: \u2018First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is\n      something bad.\u2019 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the\n      miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three\n      hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\u2019s head till\n      he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \u2018What did he say?\u2019 The peasant\n      replied: \u2018He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on\n      the porch.\u2019 The miller said: \u2018The Devil must go out,\u2019 and opened the\n      house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant\n      unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the\n      miller said: \u2018It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.\u2019 The\n      peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred\n      talers.\n     \n      At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\n      house, and the peasants said: \u2018The small peasant has certainly been to the\n      place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.\u2019\n      Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say\n      from whence his wealth came. He answered: \u2018I sold my cow\u2019s skin in the\n      town, for three hundred talers.\u2019 When the peasants heard that, they too\n      wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows,\n      and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the\n      greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \u2018But my servant must go\n      first.\u2019 When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her\n      more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give\n      them so much, and said: \u2018What can I do with all these skins?\u2019\n     \n      Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\n      outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\n      treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\n      sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\n      pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was\n      to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a\n      distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man\n      who had been with the miller\u2019s wife. He said to him: \u2018I set you free from\n      the closet, set me free from the barrel.\u2019 At this same moment up came,\n      with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long\n      been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \u2018No, I will not\n      do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\u2019 The shepherd\n      hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \u2018What are you about? What is it\n      that you will not do?\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018They want to make me mayor, if I\n      will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\u2019 The shepherd\n      said: \u2018If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would\n      get into the barrel at once.\u2019 The peasant said: \u2018If you will get in, you\n      will be mayor.\u2019 The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut\n      the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\u2019s flock for himself, and\n      drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass\n      had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water.\n      When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: \u2018I am quite willing to\n      be mayor.\u2019 They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was\n      saying this, and answered: \u2018That is what we intend, but first you shall\n      look about you a little down below there,\u2019 and they rolled the barrel down\n      into the water.\n     \n      After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village,\n      the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and\n      looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said:\n      \u2018Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\n      truly,\u2019 replied the peasant, \u2018I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got\n      to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and\n      there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and\n      from thence I brought this flock away with me.\u2019 Said the peasants: \u2018Are\n      there any more there?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018more than I could want.\u2019 Then\n      the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for\n      themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: \u2018I come first.\u2019 So they\n      went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small\n      fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they\n      were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: \u2018We already see\n      the sheep down below!\u2019 The mayor pressed forward and said: \u2018I will go down\n      first, and look about me, and if things promise well I\u2019ll call you.\u2019 So he\n      jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them,\n      and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire\n      village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\n      Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\n      \u2018Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\n      hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\u2019\n      \u2018Very well,\u2019 said she, \u2018it shall all be ready.\u2019 When dinner-time drew\n      nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put\n      it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle\n      in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she\n      said to herself, \u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the\n      cellar for the ale.\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug\n      and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the\n      jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, \u2018The\n      dog is not shut up\u2014he may be running away with the steak; that\u2019s\n      well thought of.\u2019 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the\n      rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it.\n     \n      Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\n      faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \u2018It\u2019s all gone, and \u201cwhat\n      can\u2019t be cured must be endured\u201d,\u2019 said Catherine. So she turned round; and\n      as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool\n      herself.\n     \n      Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\n      the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the\n      cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\n      happened. \u2018My stars!\u2019 said she, \u2018what shall I do to keep Frederick from\n      seeing all this slopping about?\u2019 So she thought a while; and at last\n      remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and\n      that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely.\n      \u2018What a lucky thing,\u2019 said she, \u2018that we kept that meal! we have now a\n      good use for it.\u2019 So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down\n      just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale\n      that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \u2018Ah! well,\u2019 said\n      she, \u2018when one goes another may as well follow.\u2019 Then she strewed the meal\n      all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said,\n      \u2018How very neat and clean it looks!\u2019\n     \n      At noon Frederick came home. \u2018Now, wife,\u2019 cried he, \u2018what have you for\n      dinner?\u2019 \u2018O Frederick!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I was cooking you a steak; but\n      while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I\n      ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the\n      sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is\n      now quite dry, and looks so clean!\u2019 \u2018Kate, Kate,\u2019 said he, \u2018how could you\n      do all this?\u2019 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and\n      then spoil all the meal?\u2019 \u2018Why, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018I did not know I\n      was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\u2019\n     \n      The husband thought to himself, \u2018If my wife manages matters thus, I must\n      look sharp myself.\u2019 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\n      said to Catherine, \u2018What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them\n      into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go\n      near or meddle with them.\u2019 \u2018No, Frederick,\u2019 said she, \u2018that I never will.\u2019\n      As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates\n      and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. \u2018Oh dear me, I\n      should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for\n      yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\u2019 \u2018Yellow buttons!\u2019 said they: \u2018let\n      us have a look at them.\u2019 \u2018Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and\n      you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.\u2019 So the rogues\n      went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them\n      all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all\n      about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out,\n      \u2018Kate, what have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said she, \u2018I have bought all\n      these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the\n      pedlars went themselves and dug them up.\u2019 \u2018Wife, wife,\u2019 said Frederick,\n      \u2018what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all\n      my money: how came you to do such a thing?\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 answered she, \u2018I did\n      not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.\u2019\n     \n      Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, \u2018Hark\n      ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the\n      thieves.\u2019 \u2018Well, we will try,\u2019 answered he; \u2018but take some butter and\n      cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\u2019 \u2018Very\n      well,\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he\n      left his wife some way behind. \u2018It does not matter,\u2019 thought she: \u2018when we\n      turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\u2019\n     \n      Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was\n      a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side\n      as they passed. \u2018Ah, see now,\u2019 said she, \u2018how they have bruised and\n      wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\u2019 So she took pity on\n      them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels\n      might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of\n      her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine\n      looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, \u2018Well, I suppose\n      the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I\n      have.\u2019 Then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody\n      knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the\n      road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting\n      for them.\n     \n      At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\n      eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \u2018Where are the butter and cheese?\u2019\n      said he. \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered she, \u2018I used the butter to grease those poor trees\n      that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the\n      other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road\n      together somewhere.\u2019 \u2018What a goose you are to do such silly things!\u2019 said\n      the husband. \u2018How can you say so?\u2019 said she; \u2018I am sure you never told me\n      not.\u2019\n     \n      They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \u2018Kate, I hope you\n      locked the door safe when you came away.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered she, \u2018you did not\n      tell me.\u2019 \u2018Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\u2019 said\n      Frederick, \u2018and bring with you something to eat.\u2019\n     \n      Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\n      \u2018Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\u2019t think he is very fond of\n      butter and cheese: I\u2019ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for\n      I have often seen him take some.\u2019\n     \n      When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\n      took off the hinges, and said, \u2018Frederick told me to lock the door, but\n      surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\u2019 So she took her\n      time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, \u2018There,\n      Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you\n      please.\u2019 \u2018Alas! alas!\u2019 said he, \u2018what a clever wife I have! I sent you to\n      make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go\n      in and out as they please\u2014however, as you have brought the door, you\n      shall carry it about with you for your pains.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 answered she,\n      \u2018I\u2019ll carry the door; but I\u2019ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also\u2014that\n      would be too much of a load; so if you please, I\u2019ll fasten them to the\n      door.\u2019\n     \n      Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into\n      the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when\n      it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\n      Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\n      were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\n      class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so\n      they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\n      Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\n      some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the\n      head with them: but they only said, \u2018It must be near morning, for the wind\n      shakes the fir-apples down.\u2019\n     \n      Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but\n      she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\n      softly, \u2018Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018not now,\n      they will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that: they must go.\u2019 \u2018Well, then,\n      make haste and throw them down, if you will.\u2019 Then away rattled the nuts\n      down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \u2018Bless me, it is\n      hailing.\u2019\n     \n      A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so\n      she whispered to Frederick, \u2018I must throw the vinegar down.\u2019 \u2018Pray don\u2019t,\u2019\n      answered he, \u2018it will discover us.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said she, \u2018go it\n      must.\u2019 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, \u2018What a\n      heavy dew there is!\u2019\n     \n      At last it popped into Catherine\u2019s head that it was the door itself that\n      was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \u2018Frederick, I must throw the\n      door down soon.\u2019 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was\n      sure it would betray them. \u2018Here goes, however,\u2019 said she: and down went\n      the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out\n      \u2018Murder!\u2019 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could,\n      and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there\n      they found all their money safe and sound.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\n      daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was her\n      own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated, because\n      she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which\n      the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother\n      that she must and would have that apron. \u2018Be quiet, my child,\u2019 said the\n      old woman, \u2018and you shall have it. Your stepsister has long deserved\n      death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off. Only\n      be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push her well to\n      the front.\u2019 It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not\n      just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long\n      she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the witch\u2019s\n      daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when she\n      was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the front, and took for herself\n      the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, the old woman came\n      creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to\n      see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with\n      both hands, and cut her own child\u2019s head off.\n     \n      When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\n      was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said to\n      him: \u2018Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\n      wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes, and\n      she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said Roland, \u2018I\n      counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she\n      pursues us.\u2019 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead\n      girl\u2019s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front\n      of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she hurried\n      away with her lover.\n     \n      When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\n      wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch cried:\n      \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,\u2019 answered the first\n      drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and\n      cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Here in the kitchen, I am warming myself,\u2019\n      cried the second drop of blood. She went into the kitchen, but found no\n      one. Then she cried again: \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Ah, here in the bed, I am\n      sleeping,\u2019 cried the third drop of blood. She went into the room to the\n      bed. What did she see there? Her own child, whose head she had cut off,\n      bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window,\n      and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her\n      stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. \u2018That shall not\n      help you,\u2019 cried she, \u2018even if you have got a long way off, you shall\n      still not escape me.\u2019 She put on her many-league boots, in which she\n      covered an hour\u2019s walk at every step, and it was not long before she\n      overtook them. The girl, however, when she saw the old woman striding\n      towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a\n      lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it. The witch\n      placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless\n      trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed,\n      and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come. At this the\n      girl and her sweetheart Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and\n      they walked on the whole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed\n      herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge,\n      and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch\n      came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: \u2018Dear musician,\n      may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he replied, \u2018I\n      will play to you while you do it.\u2019 As she was hastily creeping into the\n      hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who\n      the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was\n      forced to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the\n      more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her\n      clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and\n      as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\n     \n      As they were now set free, Roland said: \u2018Now I will go to my father and\n      arrange for the wedding.\u2019 \u2018Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait\n      for you,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018and that no one may recognize me, I will change\n      myself into a red stone landmark.\u2019 Then Roland went away, and the girl\n      stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. But\n      when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\n      fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\n      long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\n      changed herself into a flower, and thought: \u2018Someone will surely come this\n      way, and trample me down.\u2019\n     \n      It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\n      the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\n      laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\n      in the shepherd\u2019s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\n      already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire\n      in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he\n      came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He could not\n      conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his\n      house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was certainly\n      pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that\n      he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said:\n      \u2018There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if\n      anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it\n      is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.\u2019\n     \n      The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned, he\n      saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang towards it,\n      and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an\n      end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she\n      had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his\n      house-keeping. She told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her\n      if she would marry him, but she answered: \u2018No,\u2019 for she wanted to remain\n      faithful to her sweetheart Roland, although he had deserted her.\n      Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, but to continue keeping house\n      for the shepherd.\n     \n      And now the time drew near when Roland\u2019s wedding was to be celebrated, and\n      then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced that all\n      the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the bridal pair.\n      When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought\n      her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls\n      came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back,\n      until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.\n      But when she began her song, and it reached Roland\u2019s ears, he sprang up\n      and cried: \u2018I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no\n      other!\u2019 Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind,\n      had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then the faithful maiden held\n      her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy\n      began.\n    ",
        "\n      It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\n      around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at\n      her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as\n      she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops\n      of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that\n      sprinkled the white snow, and said, \u2018Would that my little daughter may be\n      as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony\n      windowframe!\u2019 And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as\n      white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as\n      ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\n     \n      But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\n      queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to\n      think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\n      looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\n      herself in it, and say:\n     \n      And the glass had always answered:\n     \n      But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\n      old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then\n      the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as\n      usual:\n     \n      When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one\n      of her servants, and said, \u2018Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I\n      may never see her any more.\u2019 Then the servant led her away; but his heart\n      melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, \u2018I will\n      not hurt you, thou pretty child.\u2019 So he left her by herself; and though he\n      thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he\n      felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his\n      mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of\n      someone finding and saving her.\n     \n      Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the\n      wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening\n      she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little\n      feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the\n      cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven\n      little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in\n      them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood\n      seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of\n      each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that\n      she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds;\n      but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh\n      suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.\n     \n      By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\n      dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\n      They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right.\n      The first said, \u2018Who has been sitting on my stool?\u2019 The second, \u2018Who has\n      been eating off my plate?\u2019 The third, \u2018Who has been picking my bread?\u2019 The\n      fourth, \u2018Who has been meddling with my spoon?\u2019 The fifth, \u2018Who has been\n      handling my fork?\u2019 The sixth, \u2018Who has been cutting with my knife?\u2019 The\n      seventh, \u2018Who has been drinking my wine?\u2019 Then the first looked round and\n      said, \u2018Who has been lying on my bed?\u2019 And the rest came running to him,\n      and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the\n      seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and\n      they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to\n      look at her, and said, \u2018Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!\u2019 And\n      they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the\n      seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till\n      the night was gone.\n     \n      In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and\n      said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and\n      spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care\n      of her. Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold\n      and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home; and they\n      warned her, and said, \u2018The queen will soon find out where you are, so take\n      care and let no one in.\u2019\n     \n      But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\n      must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\n      said:\n     \n      And the glass answered:\n     \n      Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\n      always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\n      And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\n      than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way\n      over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at\n      the door, and cried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 Snowdrop looked out at the\n      window, and said, \u2018Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?\u2019 \u2018Good\n      wares, fine wares,\u2019 said she; \u2018laces and bobbins of all colours.\u2019 \u2018I will\n      let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,\u2019 thought\n      Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door. \u2018Bless me!\u2019 said the old\n      woman, \u2018how badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my\n      nice new laces.\u2019 Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood\n      before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace\n      so tight, that Snowdrop\u2019s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she\n      were dead. \u2018There\u2019s an end to all thy beauty,\u2019 said the spiteful queen,\n      and went away home.\n     \n      In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved\n      they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as\n      if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found\n      what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to\n      breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, \u2018The old woman\n      was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we\n      are away.\u2019\n     \n      When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\n      as before; but to her great grief it still said:\n     \n      Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\n      Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\n      another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\n      comb. When she reached the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, she knocked at the door, and\n      cried, \u2018Fine wares to sell!\u2019 But Snowdrop said, \u2018I dare not let anyone\n      in.\u2019 Then the queen said, \u2018Only look at my beautiful combs!\u2019 and gave her\n      the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it\n      into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison\n      was so powerful that she fell down senseless. \u2018There you may lie,\u2019 said\n      the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very\n      early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they\n      thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they\n      took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they\n      warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.\n     \n      Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\n      read the very same answer as before; and she said, \u2018Snowdrop shall die, if\n      it cost me my life.\u2019 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\n      ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\n      whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\n      peasant\u2019s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\u2019 cottage, and\n      knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said,\n      \u2018I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.\u2019 \u2018Do as you\n      please,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018but at any rate take this pretty apple; I\n      will give it you.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Snowdrop, \u2018I dare not take it.\u2019 \u2018You silly\n      girl!\u2019 answered the other, \u2018what are you afraid of? Do you think it is\n      poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\u2019 Now the\n      apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was\n      poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so\n      very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer.\n      But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead\n      upon the ground. \u2018This time nothing will save thee,\u2019 said the queen; and\n      she went home to her glass, and at last it said:\n     \n      And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.\n     \n      When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying\n      on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she\n      was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her\n      face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed\n      quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and\n      bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her:\n      but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while\n      she was alive; so they said, \u2018We will never bury her in the cold ground.\u2019\n      And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and\n      wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a\n      king\u2019s daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the\n      dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too,\n      and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and\n      at last a dove, and sat by her side.\n     \n      And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\n      though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\n      as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\n      dwarfs\u2019 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\n      letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to\n      let him take her away; but they said, \u2018We will not part with her for all\n      the gold in the world.\u2019 At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave\n      him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him,\n      the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and\n      said, \u2018Where am I?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018Thou art quite safe with me.\u2019\n     \n      Then he told her all that had happened, and said, \u2018I love you far better\n      than all the world; so come with me to my father\u2019s palace, and you shall\n      be my wife.\u2019 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and\n      everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.\n     \n      To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop\u2019s old enemy the queen;\n      and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\n      glass and said:\n     \n      And the glass answered:\n     \n      When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were\n      so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when\n      she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she\n      thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down\n      and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that\n      land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and\n      paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her\n      time of need.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\n      Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\n      bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\n      and said: \u2018Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so\n      that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\u2019 Then she\n      went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was\n      come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\n     \n      Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts\n      were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It happened once\n      when the child was a little older, that it was lying in her arms and she\n      fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the child had the power\n      of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen, and cut it in pieces,\n      and dropped some of its blood on the queen\u2019s apron and on her dress. Then\n      he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to\n      suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed\n      her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the\n      blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he\n      ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be\n      seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for\n      seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two\n      angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a\n      day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.\n     \n      The cook, however, thought to himself: \u2018If the child has the power of\n      wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\u2019 So he\n      left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to speak,\n      and said to him: \u2018Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden,\n      and all else that pertains to it.\u2019 Scarcely were the words out of the\n      boy\u2019s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for. After a\n      while the cook said to him: \u2018It is not well for you to be so alone, wish\n      for a pretty girl as a companion.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s son wished for one, and\n      she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter\n      could have painted her. The two played together, and loved each other with\n      all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman. The\n      thought occurred to him, however, that the king\u2019s son might some day wish\n      to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out\n      and took the maiden aside, and said: \u2018Tonight when the boy is asleep, go\n      to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart\n      and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.\u2019 Thereupon\n      he went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and said:\n      \u2018Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed\n      anyone?\u2019 The cook once more said: \u2018If you do not do it, it shall cost you\n      your own life.\u2019 When he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to\n      her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid\n      them on a plate, and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy:\n      \u2018Lie down in your bed, and draw the clothes over you.\u2019 Then the wicked\n      wretch came in and said: \u2018Where are the boy\u2019s heart and tongue?\u2019 The girl\n      reached the plate to him, but the king\u2019s son threw off the quilt, and\n      said: \u2018You old sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce\n      thy sentence. You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round\n      your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from\n      your throat.\u2019 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\n      into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\n      were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\n      flames broke forth from his throat. The king\u2019s son remained there a short\n      while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she were still\n      alive. At length he said to the maiden: \u2018I will go home to my own country;\n      if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 she replied, \u2018the\n      way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land where I am unknown?\u2019\n      As she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from\n      each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and\n      took her with him. Then he went away to his own country, and the poodle\n      had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was\n      confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach\n      up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and cried:\n      \u2018Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you dead?\u2019 She\n      answered: \u2018I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,\u2019 for she thought the\n      angels were there. Said he: \u2018I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were\n      said to have torn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set\n      you free.\u2019 Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused\n      himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer\n      him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for\n      him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their\n      quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the huntsman\n      promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the\n      royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and bade them go\n      out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them form a\n      great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to\n      wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once,\n      and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all placed on sixty country\n      carts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck his\n      table with game, after having had none at all for years.\n     \n      Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\n      household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they\n      were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \u2018As you are so\n      clever, you shall sit by me.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Lord King, your majesty must\n      excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\u2019 But the king insisted on it, and said:\n      \u2018You shall sit by me,\u2019 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting there, he\n      thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king\u2019s principal\n      servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with\n      the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.\n      Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began, and said: \u2018Your\n      majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen living in the tower?\n      Is she still alive, or has she died?\u2019 But the king replied: \u2018She let my\n      dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.\u2019\n      Then the huntsman arose and said: \u2018Gracious lord father she is alive\n      still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by\n      that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep,\n      and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.\u2019 Thereupon he took\n      the dog with the golden collar, and said: \u2018That is the wretch!\u2019 and caused\n      live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before\n      the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the\n      huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape,\n      and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood\n      immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side. When the\n      king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the\n      deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and said: \u2018Father, will\n      you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to\n      murder me, but did not do it, though her own life depended on it?\u2019 The\n      king replied: \u2018Yes, I would like to see her.\u2019 The son said: \u2018Most gracious\n      father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,\u2019 and he\n      thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it\n      on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen\n      one to equal it. Then the son said: \u2018Now will I show her to you in her own\n      form,\u2019 and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there\n      looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\n     \n      And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to\n      fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was led in\n      she ate nothing, and said: \u2018The gracious and merciful God who has\n      supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.\u2019 She lived three days\n      more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves\n      which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven,\n      followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged king\n      ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king\u2019s\n      own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he\n      had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still\n      alive or not, is known to God.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\n      when she had grown up her father said: \u2018We will get her married.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019\n      said the mother, \u2018if only someone would come who would have her.\u2019 At\n      length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but\n      he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the\n      father, \u2018she has plenty of good sense\u2019; and the mother said: \u2018Oh, she can\n      see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019\n      said Hans, \u2018if she is not really smart, I won\u2019t have her.\u2019 When they were\n      sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: \u2018Elsie, go into the\n      cellar and fetch some beer.\u2019 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the\n      wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so\n      that the time might not appear long. When she was below she fetched\n      herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to\n      stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury. Then\n      she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was\n      running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and\n      after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which\n      the masons had accidentally left there.\n     \n      Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: \u2018If I get Hans, and we have a\n      child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\n      beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\u2019 Then she sat\n      and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\n      misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink, but\n      Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant: \u2018Just\n      go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.\u2019 The maid went and found\n      her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. \u2018Elsie why do you\n      weep?\u2019 asked the maid. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she answered, \u2018have I not reason to weep? If\n      I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer\n      here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.\u2019 Then said\n      the maid: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat down beside her and began\n      loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while, as the maid did not\n      come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to\n      the boy: \u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl\n      are.\u2019 The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both\n      weeping together. Then he asked: \u2018Why are you weeping?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Elsie,\n      \u2018have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he\n      grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head\n      and kill him.\u2019 Then said the boy: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019 and sat\n      down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for\n      the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: \u2018Just\n      go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!\u2019 The woman went down, and\n      found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was\n      the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed\n      by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe\n      fell down. Then said the mother likewise: \u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\u2019\n      and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but\n      as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said:\n      \u2018I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.\u2019 But when he got\n      into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard\n      the reason, and that Elsie\u2019s child was the cause, and the Elsie might\n      perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by\n      the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer\n      just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: \u2018Oh, what a clever\n      Elsie!\u2019 and sat down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed\n      upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought:\n      \u2018They must be waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they\n      are about.\u2019 When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and\n      lamenting quite piteously, each out-doing the other. \u2018What misfortune has\n      happened then?\u2019 asked he. \u2018Ah, dear Hans,\u2019 said Elsie, \u2018if we marry each\n      other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to\n      draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there\n      might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason\n      to weep?\u2019 \u2018Come,\u2019 said Hans, \u2018more understanding than that is not needed\n      for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,\u2019 and\n      seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\n     \n      After Hans had had her some time, he said: \u2018Wife, I am going out to work\n      and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may\n      have some bread.\u2019 \u2018Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.\u2019 After Hans had gone\n      away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with\n      her. When she came to the field she said to herself: \u2018What shall I do;\n      shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.\u2019 Then she\n      drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more\n      said: \u2018What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will\n      sleep first.\u2019 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had\n      been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: \u2018What\n      a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come\n      home to eat.\u2019 But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went\n      out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among\n      the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler\u2019s net with\n      little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping.\n      Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and\n      worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she\n      got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at\n      each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain\n      whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: \u2018Is it I, or is it\n      not I?\u2019 But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time\n      in doubt; at length she thought: \u2018I will go home and ask if it be I, or if\n      it be not I, they will be sure to know.\u2019 She ran to the door of her own\n      house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: \u2018Hans,\n      is Elsie within?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered Hans, \u2018she is within.\u2019 Hereupon she was\n      terrified, and said: \u2018Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,\u2019 and went to another\n      door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not\n      open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village,\n      and no one has seen her since.\n    ",
        "\n      A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him\n      three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the\n      man\u2019s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went\n      to his master, and said, \u2018I have worked hard for you a long time, I will\n      trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.\u2019 The farmer\n      was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took\n      out threepence, and gave him for every year\u2019s service a penny. The poor\n      fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself,\n      \u2018Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now\n      travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.\u2019 With that he put his\n      money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.\n     \n      As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\n      met him, and asked him what made him so merry. \u2018Why, what should make me\n      down-hearted?\u2019 said he; \u2018I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\n      should I care for? I have saved up my three years\u2019 earnings and have it\n      all safe in my pocket.\u2019 \u2018How much may it come to?\u2019 said the little man.\n      \u2018Full threepence,\u2019 replied the countryman. \u2018I wish you would give them to\n      me,\u2019 said the other; \u2018I am very poor.\u2019 Then the man pitied him, and gave\n      him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \u2018As you have such a\n      kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes\u2014one for every\n      penny; so choose whatever you like.\u2019 Then the countryman rejoiced at his\n      good luck, and said, \u2018I like many things better than money: first, I will\n      have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle\n      that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I\n      should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\u2019 The dwarf said he\n      should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went\n      his way.\n     \n      Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he\n      was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser:\n      close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing\n      away most joyfully. \u2018Oh, what a pretty bird!\u2019 said the miser; \u2018I would\n      give a great deal of money to have such a one.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all,\u2019 said the\n      countryman, \u2018I will soon bring it down.\u2019 Then he took up his bow, and down\n      fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept\n      into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his\n      companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance\n      and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon\n      began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he\n      himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. \u2018Oh,\n      for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2019 cried the miser, \u2018Master! master! pray let the fiddle\n      alone. What have I done to deserve this?\u2019 \u2018Thou hast shaved many a poor\n      soul close enough,\u2019 said the other; \u2018thou art only meeting thy reward\u2019: so\n      he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and\n      offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician\u2019s\n      price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the\n      miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of\n      florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some\n      poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, \u2018I will agree\n      to your proposal.\u2019 So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled\n      on very pleased with his bargain.\n     \n      Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\n      plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his\n      late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained\n      that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the\n      bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a\n      fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring\n      up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and\n      brought up to be tried.\n     \n      The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his\n      money. \u2018No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\u2019 said the\n      countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter\n      short by ordering him off to the gallows.\n     \n      So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \u2018My Lord\n      Judge, grant me one last request.\u2019 \u2018Anything but thy life,\u2019 replied the\n      other. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my\n      fiddle for the last time.\u2019 The miser cried out, \u2018Oh, no! no! for heaven\u2019s\n      sake don\u2019t listen to him! don\u2019t listen to him!\u2019 But the judge said, \u2018It is\n      only this once, he will soon have done.\u2019 The fact was, he could not refuse\n      the request, on account of the dwarf\u2019s third gift.\n     \n      Then the miser said, \u2018Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\u2019s sake.\u2019 But\n      the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\n      note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no\n      one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner\n      go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the\n      tune, all were dancing together\u2014judge, court, and miser, and all the\n      people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and\n      pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be\n      no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave\n      off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the\n      judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred\n      florins.\n     \n      Then he called to the miser, and said, \u2018Tell us now, you vagabond, where\n      you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\u2019 \u2018I stole\n      it,\u2019 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \u2018I acknowledge that\n      I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\u2019 Then the countryman stopped\n      his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\n    ",
        "\n      The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\n      nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, \u2018Always be a\n      good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\u2019 Soon\n      afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and\n      the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good\n      and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white\n      covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the sun had\n      melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife\n      had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; they were\n      fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor\n      little girl. \u2018What does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour?\u2019 said\n      they; \u2018they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the\n      kitchen-maid!\u2019 Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old\n      grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen.\n     \n      There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\n      bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the\n      sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\n      evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to\n      lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always\n      dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\n     \n      It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\n      wife\u2019s daughters what he should bring them. \u2018Fine clothes,\u2019 said the\n      first; \u2018Pearls and diamonds,\u2019 cried the second. \u2018Now, child,\u2019 said he to\n      his own daughter, \u2018what will you have?\u2019 \u2018The first twig, dear father, that\n      brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards,\u2019 said\n      she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and\n      diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a\n      green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his\n      hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave\n      it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother\u2019s grave and\n      planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears;\n      and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went\n      to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the\n      tree, and talked with her, and watched over her, and brought her whatever\n      she wished for.\n     \n      Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last\n      three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride\n      for himself. Ashputtel\u2019s two sisters were asked to come; so they called\n      her up, and said, \u2018Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes\n      for us, for we are going to dance at the king\u2019s feast.\u2019 Then she did as\n      she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she\n      thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the\n      ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. \u2018You,\n      Ashputtel!\u2019 said she; \u2018you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all,\n      and who cannot even dance\u2014you want to go to the ball? And when she\n      kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, \u2018I will throw this\n      dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours\u2019 time you have\n      picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too.\u2019\n     \n      Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\n      out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\n     \n      Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\n      came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\n      heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes. And\n      the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick,\n      pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among them all\n      they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish but left\n      the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite done, and\n      all flew out again at the windows.\n     \n      Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\n      that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, \u2018No, no! you\n      slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.\u2019 And when\n      Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, \u2018If you can in one hour\u2019s time\n      pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.\u2019 And\n      thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she shook two\n      dishes of peas into the ashes.\n     \n      But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\n      and cried out as before:\n     \n      Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\n      turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\n      chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\n      little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\n      then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\n      into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour\u2019s time all\n      was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\n      her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her\n      mother said, \u2018It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and\n      cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame\u2019: and off she went with\n      her two daughters to the ball.\n     \n      Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\n      sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\n     \n      Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\n      silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on,\n      and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her, and\n      thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful\n      in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel, taking it\n      for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\n     \n      The king\u2019s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\n      with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\n      else came to ask her to dance, he said, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\n     \n      Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go\n      home: and the king\u2019s son said, \u2018I shall go and take care of you to your\n      home\u2019; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But she\n      slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as the\n      prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the\n      door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the\n      unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\n      pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\n      within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as she\n      always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp was\n      burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could through\n      the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her\n      beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird might\n      carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey\n      frock.\n     \n      The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\n      sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\n     \n      And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had\n      worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\n      wondered at her beauty: but the king\u2019s son, who was waiting for her, took\n      her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance,\n      he said as before, \u2018This lady is dancing with me.\u2019\n     \n      When night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son followed here as\n      before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang away\n      from him all at once into the garden behind her father\u2019s house. In this\n      garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not\n      knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then\n      the king\u2019s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was\n      gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, \u2018The unknown\n      lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung\n      into the pear-tree.\u2019 The father thought to himself, \u2018Can it be Ashputtel?\u2019\n      So he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one\n      upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel\n      among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree,\n      and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and\n      then put on her little grey frock.\n     \n      The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went\n      again into the garden, and said:\n     \n      Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former\n      one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came to the\n      feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the king\u2019s\n      son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to dance,\n      he said, \u2018This lady is my partner, sir.\u2019\n     \n      When night came she wanted to go home; and the king\u2019s son would go with\n      her, and said to himself, \u2018I will not lose her this time\u2019; but, however,\n      she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\n      her left golden slipper upon the stairs.\n     \n      The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\n      and said, \u2018I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\n      fits.\u2019 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had\n      beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper.\n      The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to\n      try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go into\n      it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother\n      gave her a knife, and said, \u2018Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen\n      you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.\u2019 So the silly\n      girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe, and went to the\n      king\u2019s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his\n      horse, and rode away with her homewards.\n     \n      But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\n      had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\n     \n      Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood\n      that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he turned his\n      horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, \u2018This\n      is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.\u2019\n      Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the\n      heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood\n      came, and took her to the king\u2019s son: and he set her as his bride by his\n      side on his horse, and rode away with her.\n     \n      But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and\n      sang:\n     \n      Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\n      shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and\n      brought her also back again. \u2018This is not the true bride,\u2019 said he to the\n      father; \u2018have you no other daughters?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he; \u2018there is only a\n      little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she\n      cannot be the bride.\u2019 The prince told him to send her. But the mother\n      said, \u2018No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself.\u2019\n      However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and\n      hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden\n      slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot, and put on the\n      golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when\n      he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, \u2018This is the\n      right bride.\u2019 But the mother and both the sisters were frightened, and\n      turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away\n      with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:\n     \n      And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon her\n      right shoulder, and so went home with her.\n    ",
        "\n      A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\n      all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the\n      most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\n      strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no\n      one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It\n      was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it,\n      neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of\n      it until he was quite alone.\n     \n      This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away\n      the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying\n      the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted\n      up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it\n      he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a\n      little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue\n      than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He\n      went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were\n      chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which\n      they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him\n      power of understanding the language of animals.\n     \n      Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful\n      ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who\n      was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to be brought\n      before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before\n      the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty\n      and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no\n      better answer.\n     \n      In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\n      how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\n      together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were\n      making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\n      confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\n      They were telling one another of all the places where they had been\n      waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one\n      said in a pitiful tone: \u2018Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was\n      eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\u2019s window.\u2019\n      The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen,\n      and said to the cook: \u2018Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said\n      the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \u2018she has spared no trouble to\n      fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.\u2019 So he cut\n      off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen\u2019s ring\n      was found inside her.\n     \n      The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\n      amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the\n      best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\n      everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\n      he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was\n      granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw\n      three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is\n      said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish\n      so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put\n      the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with delight, put out\n      their heads, and cried to him: \u2018We will remember you and repay you for\n      saving us!\u2019\n     \n      He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\n      the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: \u2018Why\n      cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\n      horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\n      mercy!\u2019 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him:\n      \u2018We will remember you\u2014one good turn deserves another!\u2019\n     \n      The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing by\n      their nest, and throwing out their young ones. \u2018Out with you, you idle,\n      good-for-nothing creatures!\u2019 cried they; \u2018we cannot find food for you any\n      longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.\u2019 But the poor\n      young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: \u2018Oh,\n      what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we\n      cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?\u2019 So the good young\n      fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them\n      for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and\n      cried: \u2018We will remember you\u2014one good turn deserves another!\u2019\n     \n      And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he\n      came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the streets,\n      and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \u2018The king\u2019s daughter wants a\n      husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task, and if he\n      does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\u2019 Many had already made the\n      attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king\u2019s daughter\n      he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went\n      before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\n     \n      So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\n      his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom\n      of the sea, and added: \u2018If you come up again without it you will be thrown\n      in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\u2019 All the people\n      grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by\n      the sea.\n     \n      He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he\n      saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes\n      whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its\n      mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\u2019s feet, and when he had\n      taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of\n      joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the\n      promised reward.\n     \n      But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth,\n      she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task. She went\n      down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of\n      millet-seed on the grass; then she said: \u2018Tomorrow morning before sunrise\n      these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting.\u2019\n     \n      The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\n      to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\n      sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But\n      as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the\n      ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was\n      missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands\n      of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all\n      the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\n     \n      Presently the king\u2019s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\n      amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But\n      she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: \u2018Although he has\n      performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought\n      me an apple from the Tree of Life.\u2019 The youth did not know where the Tree\n      of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as\n      his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it. After he\n      had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and\n      lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches,\n      and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew\n      down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and said: \u2018We are the three\n      young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and\n      heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the\n      end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the\n      apple.\u2019 The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden\n      Apple to the king\u2019s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left\n      to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then\n      her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed\n      happiness to a great age.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\n      loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\n      wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven\n      to her and said: \u2018Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your\n      guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all\u2014skin,\n      hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will\n      know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\u2019 The kids said:\n      \u2018Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without\n      any anxiety.\u2019 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy\n      mind.\n     \n      It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: \u2018Open\n      the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something\n      back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the little kids knew that it was the\n      wolf, by the rough voice. \u2018We will not open the door,\u2019 cried they, \u2018you\n      are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is\n      rough; you are the wolf!\u2019 Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and\n      bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft\n      with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called:\n      \u2018Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought\n      something back with her for each of you.\u2019 But the wolf had laid his black\n      paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: \u2018We will not\n      open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!\u2019\n      Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: \u2018I have hurt my feet, rub some\n      dough over them for me.\u2019 And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he\n      ran to the miller and said: \u2018Strew some white meal over my feet for me.\u2019\n      The miller thought to himself: \u2018The wolf wants to deceive someone,\u2019 and\n      refused; but the wolf said: \u2018If you will not do it, I will devour you.\u2019\n      Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this\n      is the way of mankind.\n     \n      So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it\n      and said: \u2018Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has\n      come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest\n      with her.\u2019 The little kids cried: \u2018First show us your paws that we may\n      know if you are our dear little mother.\u2019 Then he put his paws in through\n      the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that\n      all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the\n      wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under\n      the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth\n      into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the\n      washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them\n      all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them\n      down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one\n      he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself\n      off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began\n      to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.\n      Ah! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table,\n      chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to\n      pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her\n      children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after\n      another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she came to the\n      youngest, a soft voice cried: \u2018Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.\u2019 She\n      took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all\n      the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\n     \n      At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\n      When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so\n      loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that\n      something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. \u2018Ah, heavens,\u2019\n      she said, \u2018is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down\n      for his supper, can be still alive?\u2019 Then the kid had to run home and\n      fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut open the\n      monster\u2019s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one little kid\n      thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six sprang out one\n      after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury\n      whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.\n      What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like\n      a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: \u2018Now go and look for\n      some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast\u2019s stomach with them\n      while he is still asleep.\u2019 Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither\n      with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could\n      get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that\n      he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.\n     \n      When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and\n      as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a\n      well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in\n      his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:\n     \n      And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy\n      stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven kids saw\n      that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: \u2018The wolf is dead!\n      The wolf is dead!\u2019 and danced for joy round about the well with their\n      mother.\n    ",
        "\n      Two kings\u2019 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\n      fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\n      that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\n      little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he\n      had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\n      young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\n      were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set out\n      on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two elder\n      brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in\n      their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the little\n      dwarf said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not suffer you\n      to trouble them.\u2019\n     \n      So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\n      about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the dwarf\n      said, \u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill them.\u2019\n      Next they came to a bees\u2019-nest in a hollow tree, and there was so much\n      honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a\n      fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey. But the\n      dwarf held them back, and said, \u2018Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves,\n      I cannot let you burn them.\u2019\n     \n      At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\n      stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\n      no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\n      came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\n      was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw a\n      little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\n      twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then he\n      rose and came out to them.\n     \n      He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table\n      covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk,\n      he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\n     \n      The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\n      where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\n      which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: \u2018In the\n      wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king\u2019s\n      daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun, he\n      who seeks them will be turned into marble.\u2019\n     \n      The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but\n      the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned\n      into stone as the tablet had foretold.\n     \n      The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\n      better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\n      pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\n     \n      At last came the little dwarf\u2019s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\n      was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!\u2014so he\n      sat down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\n      (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\n      it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\n      heap.\n     \n      The second tablet said: \u2018The key of the princess\u2019s bed-chamber must be\n      fished up out of the lake.\u2019 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he\n      saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived\n      down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\n     \n      The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and the\n      best of the king\u2019s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and all\n      exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar,\n      the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was\n      to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\n     \n      Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\n      from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\n      upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\n      which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\n      turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\n      married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\n      her father\u2019s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest: but\n      still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the\n      world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes.\n     \n      Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning to\n      rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and his\n      heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all\n      his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after he had\n      said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great\n      wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The good man\n      knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. He looked at\n      the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was\n      so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\n     \n      The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that he\n      willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker,\n      with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more. In the\n      evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up\n      and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he\n      got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon in came\n      buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought leather\n      enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found\n      it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what\n      was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and the good man\n      soon became thriving and well off again.\n     \n      One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\n      the fire chatting together, he said to her, \u2018I should like to sit up and\n      watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\n      me.\u2019 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\n      themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\n      there, and watched what would happen.\n     \n      As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\n      they sat themselves upon the shoemaker\u2019s bench, took up all the work that\n      was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and\n      rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\n      wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\n      job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table. This\n      was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\n      lightning.\n     \n      The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. \u2018These little wights have\n      made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn\n      if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed\n      it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off\n      the cold. I\u2019ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat\n      and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make\n      each of them a little pair of shoes.\u2019\n     \n      The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all\n      the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work\n      that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what\n      the little elves would do.\n     \n      About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room,\n      and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the\n      clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily\n      delighted.\n     \n      Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\n      capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\n      out at the door, and away over the green.\n     \n      The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from\n      that time forward, as long as they lived.\n    ",
        "\n      Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man with\n      a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much\n      that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to have one, that\n      the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they remained childless.\n     \n      In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree. One\n      winter\u2019s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she\n      was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow.\n      \u2018Ah,\u2019 sighed the woman heavily, \u2018if I had but a child, as red as blood and\n      as white as snow,\u2019 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within\n      her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to\n      the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all\n      disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green. So\n      the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods,\n      and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the\n      blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree,\n      and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she\n      was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees. Presently\n      the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when\n      they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and\n      then she grew sad and ill. A little while later she called her husband,\n      and said to him, weeping. \u2018If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.\u2019 Then\n      she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed\n      she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and\n      as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died.\n     \n      Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her.\n      By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still\n      grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he\n      married again.\n     \n      He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was\n      a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother loved her\n      daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy,\n      it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her\n      own child, and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of\n      the property for her. This evil thought took possession of her more and\n      more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She drove him from\n      place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went\n      about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time\n      he went back.\n     \n      One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store-room,\n      and said, \u2018Mother, give me an apple.\u2019 \u2018Yes, my child,\u2019 said the wife, and\n      she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very\n      heavy lid and a large iron lock.\n     \n      \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the little daughter again, \u2018may not brother have one too?\u2019\n      The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \u2018Yes, when he comes out of\n      school.\u2019\n     \n      Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\n      as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out of\n      her little daughter\u2019s hand, and said, \u2018You shall not have one before your\n      brother.\u2019 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The little\n      boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to\n      him, \u2018My son, will you have an apple?\u2019 but she gave him a wicked look.\n      \u2018Mother,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018how dreadful you look! Yes, give me an apple.\u2019\n      The thought came to her that she would kill him. \u2018Come with me,\u2019 she said,\n      and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \u2018take one out for yourself.\u2019 And\n      as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went\n      the lid, and off went the little boy\u2019s head. Then she was overwhelmed with\n      fear at the thought of what she had done. \u2018If only I can prevent anyone\n      knowing that I did it,\u2019 she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and\n      took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy\u2019s\n      head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that\n      nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple\n      in his hand.\n     \n      Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a\n      pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \u2018Mother, brother is sitting\n      by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale; and when I\n      asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that frightened\n      me.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Go to him again,\u2019 said her mother, \u2018and if he does not answer, give him a\n      box on the ear.\u2019 So little Marleen went, and said, \u2018Brother, give me that\n      apple,\u2019 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear, and\n      his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and\n      screaming to her mother. \u2018Oh!\u2019 she said, \u2018I have knocked off brother\u2019s\n      head,\u2019 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\n     \n      \u2018What have you done!\u2019 said her mother, \u2018but no one must know about it, so\n      you must keep silence; what is done can\u2019t be undone; we will make him into\n      puddings.\u2019 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him into\n      puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on, and wept\n      and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of\n      salt.\n     \n      Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\n      \u2018Where is my son?\u2019 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\n      black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\n     \n      The father again asked, \u2018Where is my son?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Oh,\u2019 answered the wife, \u2018he is gone into the country to his mother\u2019s\n      great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\n      weeks; he is well looked after there.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018I feel very unhappy about it,\u2019 said the husband, \u2018in case it should not\n      be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\u2019\n     \n      With this he went on with his dinner, and said, \u2018Little Marleen, why do\n      you weep? Brother will soon be back.\u2019 Then he asked his wife for more\n      pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\n     \n      Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\n      her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\n      table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep.\n      Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had\n      no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept\n      no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved\n      backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together\n      again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. After this a\n      mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of\n      fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into\n      the air, singing magnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the\n      juniper-tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the\n      bones were gone.\n     \n      Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\n      still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the\n      table and ate.\n     \n      The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\n      sing:\n     \n      The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\n      song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got up\n      and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers.\n      But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on one foot\n      and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still held the\n      gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing up at the\n      bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\n     \n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 said the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\n      chain, and I will sing it you again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Here is the chain, take it,\u2019 said the goldsmith. \u2018Only sing me that\n      again.\u2019\n     \n      The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he\n      alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\n     \n      Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker\u2019s house and\n      sang:\n     \n      The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\n      shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand\n      over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\n     \n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018how beautifully you sing!\u2019 Then he called through the\n      door to his wife: \u2018Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it and\n      hear how beautifully it sings.\u2019 Then he called his daughter and the\n      children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\n      street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and\n      green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright\n      stars in its head.\n     \n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018sing me that song again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; you must give\n      me something.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Wife,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see\n      a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.\u2019 The wife went in and fetched the\n      shoes.\n     \n      \u2018There, bird,\u2019 said the shoemaker, \u2018now sing me that song again.\u2019\n     \n      The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\n      went back to the roof and sang:\n     \n      When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw and\n      the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the mill went\n      \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019 Inside the mill were twenty of\n      the miller\u2019s men hewing a stone, and as they went \u2018Hick hack, hick hack,\n      hick hack,\u2019 the mill went \u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\u2019\n     \n      The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\n     \n      then one of the men left off,\n     \n      two more men left off and listened,\n     \n      then four more left off,\n     Now there were only eight at work, and now only five, and now only one,\n \n      then he looked up and the last one had left off work.\n     \n      \u2018Bird,\u2019 he said, \u2018what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\n      too; sing it again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Nay,\u2019 answered the bird, \u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\n      millstone, and I will sing it again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018If it belonged to me alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018you should have it.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 said the others: \u2018if he will sing again, he can have it.\u2019\n     \n      The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\n      stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\n      the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree\n      and sang\u2014\n     \n      And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the chain\n      in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round his\n      neck, he flew right away to his father\u2019s house.\n     \n      The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\n     \n      \u2018How lighthearted I feel,\u2019 said the father, \u2018so pleased and cheerful.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018And I,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\n      were coming.\u2019\n     \n      But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\n     \n      Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\n     \n      \u2018I do feel so happy,\u2019 said the father, \u2018and how beautifully the sun\n      shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Ah!\u2019 said the wife, \u2018and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that my\n      teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,\u2019 and she\n      tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the corner\n      and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\n     \n      The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\n     \n      the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\n      nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a violent\n      storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\n     \n      \u2018Look, mother,\u2019 said the man, \u2018at the beautiful bird that is singing so\n      magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\n      scent of spice in the air!\u2019\n     \n      then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\n     \n      \u2018I must go outside and see the bird nearer,\u2019 said the man.\n     \n      \u2018Ah, do not go!\u2019 cried the wife. \u2018I feel as if the whole house were in\n      flames!\u2019\n     \n      But the man went out and looked at the bird.\n     \n      With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\n      man\u2019s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\n     \n      He went inside, and said, \u2018See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given\n      me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.\u2019\n     \n      But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor, and\n      her cap fell from her head.\n     \n      Then the bird began again:\n     \n      \u2018Ah me!\u2019 cried the wife, \u2018if I were but a thousand feet beneath the earth,\n      that I might not hear that song.\u2019\n     \n      then the woman fell down again as if dead.\n     \n      \u2018Well,\u2019 said little Marleen, \u2018I will go out too and see if the bird will\n      give me anything.\u2019\n     \n      So she went out.\n     \n      and he threw down the shoes to her,\n     \n      And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\n      danced and jumped about in them. \u2018I was so miserable,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I\n      came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\n      and he has given me a pair of red shoes.\u2019\n     \n      The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\n      of fire. \u2018Then I will go out too,\u2019 she said, \u2018and see if it will lighten\n      my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.\u2019\n     \n      But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone down\n      on her head, and she was crushed to death.\n     \n      The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\n      saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\n      passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little\n      Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside\n      together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\n    ",
        "\n      There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the\n      other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\n      pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\n      and sowed turnips.\n     \n      When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\n      it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\n      growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there\n      never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it was so\n      big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the\n      gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be\n      a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, \u2018What shall I do\n      with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating,\n      the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to\n      carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\u2019\n     \n      Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to\n      the king. \u2018What a wonderful thing!\u2019 said the king; \u2018I have seen many\n      strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you get\n      the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of\n      fortune.\u2019 \u2018Ah, no!\u2019 answered the gardener, \u2018I am no child of fortune; I am\n      a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside\n      my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is\n      rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but\n      because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\u2019\n     \n      The king then took pity on him, and said, \u2018You shall be poor no longer. I\n      will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.\u2019\n      Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his\n      brother\u2019s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\n     \n      When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener\n      so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive\n      to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage\n      more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold\n      and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift\n      in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what\n      must his present be worth?\n     \n      The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give\n      in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the\n      soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When\n      he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at\n      length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his\n      brother.\n     \n      So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\n      lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \u2018Dear brother, I have\n      found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\n      us.\u2019 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\n      together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon\n      him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\n     \n      But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\n      horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\n      prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\n      cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime he\n      worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his\n      head.\n     \n      When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who\n      was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as the\n      man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, \u2018Good\n      morning! good morning to thee, my friend!\u2019 The student looked about\n      everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from,\n      cried out, \u2018Who calls me?\u2019\n     \n      Then the man in the tree answered, \u2018Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I\n      sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and\n      wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is\n      as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and\n      shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here I discern the\n      signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the\n      winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick;\n      the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones. Wert thou\n      but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of\n      knowledge.\n     \n      The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\n      \u2018Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let\n      me into the sack for a little while?\u2019 Then the other answered, as if very\n      unwillingly, \u2018A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt\n      reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour\n      below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.\u2019\n     \n      So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\n      heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\n      for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\n      way, and said, \u2018Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\n      yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\u2019 So the student let him down,\n      opened the sack, and set him free. \u2018Now then,\u2019 cried he, \u2018let me ascend\n      quickly.\u2019 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \u2018Wait a\n      while,\u2019 said the gardener, \u2018that is not the way.\u2019 Then he pushed him in\n      head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom\n      dangling in the air. \u2018How is it with thee, friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018dost thou\n      not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a\n      wiser man than thou wert.\u2019\n     \n      So saying, he trotted off on the student\u2019s nag, and left the poor fellow\n      to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\n    ",

Then Hans goes to his mother. \u2018Good evening, mother.\u2019 \u2018Good\n      evening, Hans. Where have you been?\u2019 \u2018With Gretel.\u2019 \u2018What did you take\n      her?\u2019 \u2018I took her nothing.\u2019 \u2018What did Gretel give you?\u2019 \u2018She gave me\n      nothing, she came with me.\u2019 \u2018Where have you left Gretel?\u2019 \u2018I led her by\n      the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.\u2019 \u2018That\n      was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.\u2019 \u2018Never\n      mind, will do better.\u2019\n     \n      Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves\u2019 and sheep\u2019s eyes, and\n      threw them in Gretel\u2019s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself loose\n      and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\n    ",
        "\n      An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was\n      stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: \u2018Hark you, my son,\n      try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from hence, I\n      will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he\n      can do with you.\u2019 The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a\n      whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again,\n      and his father asked: \u2018Now, my son, what have you learnt?\u2019 \u2018Father, I have\n      learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\u2019 \u2018Lord have mercy on us!\u2019 cried\n      the father; \u2018is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another\n      town, to another master.\u2019 The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year\n      with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked: \u2018My\n      son, what have you learnt?\u2019 He answered: \u2018Father, I have learnt what the\n      birds say.\u2019 Then the father fell into a rage and said: \u2018Oh, you lost man,\n      you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed\n      to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you\n      learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.\u2019 The youth\n      remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home\n      again, and his father inquired: \u2018My son, what have you learnt?\u2019 he\n      answered: \u2018Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.\u2019\n      Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his\n      people thither, and said: \u2018This man is no longer my son, I drive him\n      forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.\u2019\n      They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not\n      do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a\n      deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.\n     \n      The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\n      begged for a night\u2019s lodging. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the lord of the castle, \u2018if you\n      will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn\n      you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which\n      bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given\n      to them, whom they at once devour.\u2019 The whole district was in sorrow and\n      dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The\n      youth, however, was without fear, and said: \u2018Just let me go down to the\n      barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do\n      nothing to harm me.\u2019 As he himself would have it so, they gave him some\n      food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went\n      inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite\n      amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one\n      hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came\n      out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: \u2018The dogs\n      have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and\n      bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over\n      a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest\n      until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse,\n      how that is to be done.\u2019 Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of\n      the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it\n      successfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did\n      it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The howling\n      of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and\n      the country was freed from the trouble.\n     \n      After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\n      the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\n      croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were\n      saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where\n      the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as\n      to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that\n      the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some\n      divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young\n      count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on\n      his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized\n      therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be\n      pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the\n      doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he\n      anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from\n      the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his\n      Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word\n      of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all\n      in his ear.\n    ",
        "\n      It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\n      herself: \u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\n      world,\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox, how\n      are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?\u2019\n      The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to\n      foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or\n      not. At last he said: \u2018Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool,\n      you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have you the cheek\n      to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How many arts do you\n      understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand but one,\u2019 replied the cat, modestly. \u2018What art\n      is that?\u2019 asked the fox. \u2018When the hounds are following me, I can spring\n      into a tree and save myself.\u2019 \u2018Is that all?\u2019 said the fox. \u2018I am master of\n      a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make\n      me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from\n      the hounds.\u2019 Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly\n      up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and foliage\n      quite concealed her. \u2018Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\u2019 cried the\n      cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him\n      fast. \u2018Ah, Mr Fox,\u2019 cried the cat. \u2018You with your hundred arts are left in\n      the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost\n      your life.\u2019\n    ",
        "\n      \u2018Dear children,\u2019 said a poor man to his four sons, \u2018I have nothing to give\n      you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin by\n      learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.\u2019 So the four\n      brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\n      bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\n      all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came to\n      four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest said,\n      \u2018Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this\n      spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself.\u2019\n     \n      So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met\n      him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. \u2018I am going to\n      try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning some art or\n      trade,\u2019 answered he. \u2018Then,\u2019 said the man, \u2018go with me, and I will teach\n      you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the other,\n      \u2018that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the\n      end but the gallows?\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said the man, \u2018you need not fear the gallows;\n      for I will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: I meddle with\n      nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about, and where no\n      one can find you out.\u2019 So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he\n      soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had\n      once set his mind upon.\n     \n      The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\n      setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. \u2018I do not know\n      yet,\u2019 said he. \u2018Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a noble art,\n      for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand the stars.\u2019\n      The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful star-gazer,\n      that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave his master, he\n      gave him a glass, and said, \u2018With this you can see all that is passing in\n      the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from you.\u2019\n     \n      The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him so\n      well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the craft\n      of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and said,\n      \u2018Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.\u2019\n     \n      The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\n      do. \u2018Would not you like,\u2019 said he, \u2018to be a tailor?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 said the\n      young man; \u2018sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards\n      and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 answered\n      the man, \u2018that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me, and you will\n      learn quite another kind of craft from that.\u2019 Not knowing what better to\n      do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and\n      when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said, \u2018You can sew\n      anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the\n      joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.\u2019\n     \n      After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four brothers\n      met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other, set off\n      towards their father\u2019s home, where they told him all that had happened to\n      them, and how each had learned some craft.\n     \n      Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\n      tree, the father said, \u2018I should like to try what each of you can do in\n      this way.\u2019 So he looked up, and said to the second son, \u2018At the top of\n      this tree there is a chaffinch\u2019s nest; tell me how many eggs there are in\n      it.\u2019 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, \u2018Five.\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019\n      said the father to the eldest son, \u2018take away the eggs without letting the\n      bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know anything of what you\n      are doing.\u2019 So the cunning thief climbed up the tree, and brought away to\n      his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt\n      what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its ease. Then the father took\n      the eggs, and put one on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the\n      middle, and said to the huntsman, \u2018Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one\n      shot.\u2019 The huntsman took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five\n      eggs as his father wished.\n     \n      \u2018Now comes your turn,\u2019 said he to the young tailor; \u2018sew the eggs and the\n      young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall have\n      done them no harm.\u2019 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as\n      he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to\n      the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it. Then she\n      went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and\n      had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn\n      them together.\n     \n      \u2018Well done, sons!\u2019 said the old man; \u2018you have made good use of your time,\n      and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which\n      ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn\n      your skill to some account!\u2019\n     \n      Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\n      king\u2019s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\n      mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\n      brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four brothers\n      said to each other, \u2018Here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do.\u2019\n      And they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. \u2018I\n      will soon find out where she is, however,\u2019 said the star-gazer, as he\n      looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, \u2018I see her afar off,\n      sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the dragon close by,\n      guarding her.\u2019 Then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself\n      and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to\n      the right place. There they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer\n      had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon\n      her lap. \u2018I dare not shoot at him,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018for I should kill\n      the beautiful young lady also.\u2019 \u2018Then I will try my skill,\u2019 said the\n      thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and\n      gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring.\n     \n      Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\n      ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he\n      awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and wanted\n      to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took up his\n      bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead.\n      They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall\n      he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few\n      planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put\n      some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about\n      and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so\n      quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and\n      got home safe.\n     \n      When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\n      rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, \u2018One of you shall marry her,\n      but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.\u2019 Then there\n      arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, \u2018If I had not found\n      the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she\n      ought to be mine.\u2019 \u2018Your seeing her would have been of no use,\u2019 said the\n      thief, \u2018if I had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought\n      to be mine.\u2019 \u2018No, she is mine,\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018for if I had not\n      killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you and the princess\n      into pieces.\u2019 \u2018And if I had not sewn the boat together again,\u2019 said the\n      tailor, \u2018you would all have been drowned, therefore she is mine.\u2019 Then the\n      king put in a word, and said, \u2018Each of you is right; and as all cannot\n      have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for\n      the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. But to make\n      up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half\n      a kingdom.\u2019 So the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better\n      than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them.\n      And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they\n      lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their\n      father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let\n      either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.\n    ",
        "\n      A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey;\n      but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back\n      for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the\n      third, who was called Lily, said, \u2018Dear father, bring me a rose.\u2019 Now it\n      was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as\n      she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father\n      said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid them\n      goodbye.\n     \n      And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels\n      for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and\n      when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people\n      laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This\n      grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was\n      journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine\n      castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed\n      to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest\n      flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and\n      buried in the snow. \u2018A lucky hit!\u2019 said he, as he called to his servant,\n      and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring\n      him away one of the finest flowers.\n     \n      This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\n      lion, and roared out, \u2018Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\n      alive!\u2019 Then the man said, \u2018I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\n      can nothing save my life?\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 said the lion, \u2018nothing, unless you\n      undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree\n      to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.\u2019\n      But the man was unwilling to do so and said, \u2018It may be my youngest\n      daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.\u2019\n      Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018It may perhaps be only\n      a cat or a dog.\u2019 And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took\n      the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first\n      on his return.\n     \n      And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter,\n      that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and\n      when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad.\n      But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, \u2018Alas, my\n      dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said\n      I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in\n      pieces, and eat you.\u2019 Then he told her all that had happened, and said she\n      should not go, let what would happen.\n     \n      But she comforted him, and said, \u2018Dear father, the word you have given\n      must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\n      me come safe home again.\u2019\n     \n      The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\n      father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\n      an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\n      evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\n      castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\n      wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\n      prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\n      court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she\n      knew not whither, till the night came again.\n     \n      After some time he said to her, \u2018Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\n      your father\u2019s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you\n      wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\u2019 Then she\n      rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out\n      with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\n      thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\n      stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\n     \n      Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to\n      the wedding, she said to the prince, \u2018I will not go alone this time\u2014you\n      must go with me.\u2019 But he would not, and said that it would be a very\n      hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon\n      him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed\n      into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years.\n      However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light\n      should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and took with them\n      their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to\n      sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw\n      that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great\n      pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches\n      before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a\n      moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she\n      found only a white dove; and it said to her, \u2018Seven years must I fly up\n      and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let\n      fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it,\n      and at last you may overtake and set me free.\u2019\n     \n      This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now\n      and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.\n      Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the\n      right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she\n      began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming\n      when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one\n      day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she\n      lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove. \u2018Now,\u2019 thought she to\n      herself, \u2018no aid of man can be of use to me.\u2019 So she went to the sun and\n      said, \u2018Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill\u2019s top and the valley\u2019s depth\u2014hast\n      thou anywhere seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the sun, \u2018I have not seen\n      it; but I will give thee a casket\u2014open it when thy hour of need\n      comes.\u2019\n     \n      So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the\n      moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, \u2018Thou shinest through the night,\n      over field and grove\u2014hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019\n      said the moon, \u2018I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg\u2014break\n      it when need comes.\u2019\n     \n      Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\n      raised up her voice to it, and said, \u2018Thou blowest through every tree and\n      under every leaf\u2014hast thou not seen my white dove?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the\n      night-wind, \u2018but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.\u2019\n      Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen\n      it, but the south wind said, \u2018I have seen the white dove\u2014he has fled\n      to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years\n      are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is\n      an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.\u2019 Then the\n      night-wind said, \u2018I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the\n      right shore stand many rods\u2014count them, and when thou comest to the\n      eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will\n      have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms.\n      Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by\n      the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as\n      possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will also\n      give thee this nut,\u2019 continued the night-wind. \u2018When you are half-way\n      over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a\n      high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he\n      would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou\n      dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the\n      sea.\u2019\n     \n      So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said;\n      and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion\n      forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner\n      was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by\n      the arm and sprang on to the griffin\u2019s back, and went off carrying the\n      prince away with her.\n     \n      Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took\n      heart and said, \u2018As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows,\n      I will journey on, till I find him once again.\u2019 She went on for a long,\n      long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had\n      carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and she heard that\n      the wedding was about to be held. \u2018Heaven aid me now!\u2019 said she; and she\n      took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a\n      dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it on, and went into the\n      palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride\n      so much that she asked whether it was to be sold. \u2018Not for gold and\n      silver.\u2019 said she, \u2018but for flesh and blood.\u2019 The princess asked what she\n      meant, and she said, \u2018Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his\n      chamber, and I will give thee the dress.\u2019 At last the princess agreed, but\n      she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he\n      might not hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen\n      asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his\n      feet, and said: \u2018I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun,\n      the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee\n      to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?\u2019 But the prince\n      all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and\n      seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\n     \n      Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\n      when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\n      and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of the\n      egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a\n      hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled\n      under the old one\u2019s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the\n      world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them\n      from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if\n      she would sell the brood. \u2018Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and\n      blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber,\n      and I will give thee the whole brood.\u2019\n     \n      Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what she\n      asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain\n      why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him\n      all\u2014how he had given him a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden\n      had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that\n      night. Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and\n      when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and\n      how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife\u2019s\n      voice, and sprang up, and said, \u2018You have awakened me as from a dream, for\n      the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had\n      altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.\u2019\n     \n      And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\n      themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea. When\n      they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water, and\n      immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\n      rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\n      their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\n      troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\n    ",
        "\n      A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him:\n      but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing\n      more to eat, and said, \u2018I want you no longer, so take yourself off out of\n      my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a\n      lion.\u2019 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\n     \n      The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood,\n      seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox\n      met him: \u2018What\u2019s the matter, my friend?\u2019 said he, \u2018why do you hang down\n      your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 replied the horse,\n      \u2018justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all\n      that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work\n      he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he\n      will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I\n      have none, or he would not talk so.\u2019\n     \n      However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, \u2018I will help you; lie\n      down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead.\u2019 The\n      horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the lion who lived\n      in a cave close by, and said to him, \u2018A little way off lies a dead horse;\n      come with me and you may make an excellent meal of his carcase.\u2019 The lion\n      was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and when they came to the\n      horse, the fox said, \u2018You will not be able to eat him comfortably here;\n      I\u2019ll tell you what\u2014I will tie you fast to his tail, and then you can\n      draw him to your den, and eat him at your leisure.\u2019\n     \n      This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the fox\n      to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\n      together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\n      could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\n      horse on the shoulder, and said, \u2018Jip! Dobbin! Jip!\u2019 Then up he sprang,\n      and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar and\n      bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse\n      let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his master\u2019s\n      house.\n     \n      \u2018Here he is, master,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have got the better of him\u2019: and when\n      the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. \u2018Thou\n      shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.\u2019 And so the poor old\n      horse had plenty to eat, and lived\u2014till he died.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\n      king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\n      because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\n      \u2018You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\n      receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service\n      for them.\u2019 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away\n      greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he\n      entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up\n      to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \u2018Do give me one night\u2019s\n      lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\u2019 said he to her, \u2018or I shall\n      starve.\u2019 \u2018Oho!\u2019 she answered, \u2018who gives anything to a run-away soldier?\n      Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.\u2019\n      \u2018What do you wish?\u2019 said the soldier. \u2018That you should dig all round my\n      garden for me, tomorrow.\u2019 The soldier consented, and next day laboured\n      with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. \u2018I see well\n      enough,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018that you can do no more today, but I will keep\n      you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a\n      load of wood, and chop it small.\u2019 The soldier spent the whole day in doing\n      it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night\n      more. \u2018Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work.\n      Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen,\n      it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.\u2019 Next\n      day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He\n      found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did\n      draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand\n      and wanted to take the blue light away from him. \u2018No,\u2019 said he, perceiving\n      her evil intention, \u2018I will not give you the light until I am standing\n      with both feet upon the ground.\u2019 The witch fell into a passion, let him\n      fall again into the well, and went away.\n     \n      The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\n      light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\n      that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then\n      suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still\n      half full. \u2018This shall be my last pleasure,\u2019 thought he, pulled it out,\n      lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled\n      about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and\n      said: \u2018Lord, what are your commands?\u2019 \u2018What my commands are?\u2019 replied the\n      soldier, quite astonished. \u2018I must do everything you bid me,\u2019 said the\n      little man. \u2018Good,\u2019 said the soldier; \u2018then in the first place help me out\n      of this well.\u2019 The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an\n      underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with\n      him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had\n      collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could\n      carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: \u2018Now go and bind the\n      old witch, and carry her before the judge.\u2019 In a short time she came by\n      like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was\n      it long before the little man reappeared. \u2018It is all done,\u2019 said he, \u2018and\n      the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my\n      lord?\u2019 inquired the dwarf. \u2018At this moment, none,\u2019 answered the soldier;\n      \u2018you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.\u2019\n      \u2018Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue\n      light, and I will appear before you at once.\u2019 Thereupon he vanished from\n      his sight.\n     \n      The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the best\n      inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish\n      him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had\n      taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: \u2018I\n      have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to\n      hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\u2019 \u2018What am I to do?\u2019 asked the\n      little man. \u2018Late at night, when the king\u2019s daughter is in bed, bring her\n      here in her sleep, she shall do servant\u2019s work for me.\u2019 The manikin said:\n      \u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you,\n      for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\u2019 When twelve o\u2019clock had\n      struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess.\n      \u2018Aha! are you there?\u2019 cried the soldier, \u2018get to your work at once! Fetch\n      the broom and sweep the chamber.\u2019 When she had done this, he ordered her\n      to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: \u2018Pull\n      off my boots,\u2019 and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them\n      up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he\n      bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the\n      first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and\n      laid her in her bed.\n     \n      Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him\n      that she had had a very strange dream. \u2018I was carried through the streets\n      with the rapidity of lightning,\u2019 said she, \u2018and taken into a soldier\u2019s\n      room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his\n      boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am\n      just as tired as if I really had done everything.\u2019 \u2018The dream may have\n      been true,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your\n      pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you\n      are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the\n      streets.\u2019 But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when\n      he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again\n      carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her\n      pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before\n      scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was\n      compelled to do servant\u2019s work until cock-crow.\n     \n      Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\n      all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\n      peas, and saying: \u2018It must have rained peas, last night.\u2019 \u2018We must think\n      of something else,\u2019 said the king; \u2018keep your shoes on when you go to bed,\n      and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of\n      them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\u2019 The black manikin heard this\n      plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the\n      princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to\n      counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the\n      soldier\u2019s house it would go badly with him. \u2018Do what I bid you,\u2019 replied\n      the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work\n      like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n     \n      Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\u2019s\n      shoe. It was found at the soldier\u2019s, and the soldier himself, who at the\n      entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\n      and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\n      things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his\n      pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his\n      dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\n      soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\n      him: \u2018Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the\n      inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\u2019 His comrade ran thither\n      and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he\n      lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \u2018Have no fear,\u2019 said the\n      latter to his master. \u2018Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what\n      they will, only take the blue light with you.\u2019 Next day the soldier was\n      tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to\n      death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king.\n      \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.\u2019\n      \u2018You may smoke three,\u2019 answered the king, \u2018but do not imagine that I will\n      spare your life.\u2019 Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at\n      the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the\n      manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: \u2018What does my\n      lord command?\u2019 \u2018Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his\n      constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.\u2019 Then the\n      manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and\n      whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not\n      venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the\n      soldier\u2019s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his\n      kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\n      alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\n      quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\n      flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \u2018I wish you were\n      a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\u2019 Scarcely\n      were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was turned\n      into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The bird\n      took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and\n      meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\n     \n      Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a\n      raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew near,\n      the raven said, \u2018I am by birth a king\u2019s daughter, but am now under the\n      spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.\u2019 \u2018What am I to\n      do?\u2019 he asked. She replied, \u2018Go farther into the wood until you come to a\n      house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but\n      you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep,\n      and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large\n      tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me. I shall drive there\n      in my carriage at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon for three successive days;\n      the first day it will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut,\n      and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and I\n      find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.\u2019\n     \n      The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, \u2018Alas! I\n      know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to\n      save me.\u2019 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch a\n      thing to eat or drink.\n     \n      When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\n      said, \u2018Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\n      something to eat and drink.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018No,\u2019 answered the man, \u2018I will neither eat not drink.\u2019\n     \n      But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \u2018If you will not\n      eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts\n      for nothing,\u2019 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.\n     \n      As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and\n      mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue\n      came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while,\n      fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes\n      closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all\n      the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two o\u2019clock the\n      raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before\n      she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \u2018I know he has fallen\n      asleep.\u2019 When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had\n      feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage\n      and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he\n      still continued sleeping.\n     \n      The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and drink\n      which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent entreaties\n      that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank again.\n     \n      Towards two o\u2019clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\n      watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel so\n      tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could not\n      stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. As\n      the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to\n      herself, \u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\u2019 She went as before to look for\n      him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\n     \n      The following day the old woman said to him, \u2018What is this? You are not\n      eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\u2019\n     \n      He answered, \u2018I may not and will not either eat or drink.\u2019\n     \n      But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\n      and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\n      took a deep draught.\n     \n      When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in the\n      garden to await the king\u2019s daughter, but he felt even more overcome with\n      weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down, he\n      slept like a log. At two o\u2019clock the raven could be seen approaching, and\n      this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her horses,\n      were black.\n     \n      She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, \u2018I know\n      he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.\u2019 She found him\n      sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail. Then\n      she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such\n      a kind, that however much he took of them, they would never grow less.\n      After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her\n      finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid a letter near him,\n      in which, after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left\n      for him, she finished with the following words: \u2018I see that as long as you\n      remain here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still\n      wish to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within\n      your power to accomplish.\u2019 She then returned to her carriage and drove to\n      the golden castle of Stromberg.\n     \n      When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at\n      heart, and said, \u2018She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it\n      is now too late for me to save her.\u2019 Then his eyes fell on the things\n      which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it all that\n      had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to\n      reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he\n      ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at\n      last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days\n      and still could not find a way out. Once more the night came on, and worn\n      out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he\n      pursued his way through the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest\n      again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that\n      he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people\n      had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead\n      of him, he went towards it.\n     \n      He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it\n      really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant\n      who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \u2018If the giant sees me\n      going in, my life will not be worth much.\u2019 However, after a while he\n      summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him, he called\n      out, \u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had anything to\n      eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\u2019 \u2018I would rather\n      you let that alone,\u2019 said the man, \u2018for I do not willingly give myself up\n      to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your\n      hunger.\u2019 \u2018If that is so,\u2019 replied the giant, \u2018I will leave you in peace; I\n      only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\u2019\n     \n      So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\n      bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were\n      still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and\n      drank to his heart\u2019s content. When he had finished his supper the man\n      asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg. The giant\n      said, \u2018I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns, villages,\n      and houses.\u2019 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle, but could\n      not find it. \u2018Never mind,\u2019 he said, \u2018I have larger maps upstairs in the\n      cupboard, we will look on those,\u2019 but they searched in vain, for the\n      castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought he should like to\n      continue his journey, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two\n      longer until the return of his brother, who was away in search of\n      provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of\n      Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he\n      had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his\n      supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps,\n      but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and\n      they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it\n      was many thousand miles away. \u2018How shall I be able to get there?\u2019 asked\n      the man. \u2018I have two hours to spare,\u2019 said the giant, \u2018and I will carry\n      you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then return to look after\n      the child who is in our care.\u2019\n     \n      The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of\n      the castle, where he left him, saying, \u2018You will be able to walk the\n      remainder of the way yourself.\u2019 The man journeyed on day and night till he\n      reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated, however, on\n      a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden\n      drive round her castle and then go inside. He was overjoyed to see her,\n      and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so\n      slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. When he\n      saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said\n      to himself, \u2018I will remain here and wait for her,\u2019 so he built himself a\n      little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day\n      he saw the king\u2019s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable\n      to get nearer to her.\n     \n      Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\n      called out to them, \u2018God be with you.\u2019 They stopped when they heard the\n      call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\n      fighting, which now became more furious. \u2018God be with you,\u2019 he cried\n      again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back\n      to their fighting. A third time he called out, \u2018God be with you,\u2019 and then\n      thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three\n      men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one\n      another. One of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but\n      to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass, and it\n      immediately flew open. Another told him that he had found a cloak which\n      rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which\n      would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain.\n      They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have\n      the things in common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the\n      man said, \u2018I will give you something in exchange for those three things;\n      not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more\n      value. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about\n      your three things is true.\u2019 The robbers, therefore, made him get on the\n      horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this\n      round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick\n      and beat them one after another, crying, \u2018There, you idle vagabonds, you\n      have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!\u2019\n     \n      After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of the\n      castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick, and it\n      flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the steps and\n      entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full\n      of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still wore his\n      cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw\n      it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom. \u2018That is my\n      own ring,\u2019 she exclaimed, \u2018and if that is so the man must also be here who\n      is coming to set me free.\u2019\n     \n      She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere. Meanwhile\n      he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak.\n      When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud\n      for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him,\n      and said, \u2018Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate\n      our marriage.\u2019\n    ",
        "\n      There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\n      Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\n     \n[*] Simpleton\n \n      It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and\n      before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of\n      wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\n     \n      When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\n      him good day, and said: \u2018Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\n      and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 But\n      the clever son answered: \u2018If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\n      none for myself; be off with you,\u2019 and he left the little man standing and\n      went on.\n     \n      But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\n      false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\n      and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\u2019s doing.\n     \n      After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\n      like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man met\n      him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine. But\n      the second son, too, said sensibly enough: \u2018What I give you will be taken\n      away from myself; be off!\u2019 and he left the little man standing and went\n      on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows\n      at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried\n      home.\n     \n      Then Dummling said: \u2018Father, do let me go and cut wood.\u2019 The father\n      answered: \u2018Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you\n      do not understand anything about it.\u2019 But Dummling begged so long that at\n      last he said: \u2018Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.\u2019 His\n      mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with\n      it a bottle of sour beer.\n     \n      When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and\n      greeting him, said: \u2018Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your\n      bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.\u2019 Dummling answered: \u2018I have only\n      cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.\u2019\n      So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a\n      fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine. So they ate and\n      drank, and after that the little man said: \u2018Since you have a good heart,\n      and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck. There\n      stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the\n      roots.\u2019 Then the little man took leave of him.\n     \n      Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\n      sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\n      taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\n      night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\n      curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked\n      to have one of its golden feathers.\n     \n      The eldest thought: \u2018I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\n      feather,\u2019 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the\n      wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\n     \n      The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\n      feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was\n      held fast.\n     \n      At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed\n      out: \u2018Keep away; for goodness\u2019 sake keep away!\u2019 But she did not understand\n      why she was to keep away. \u2018The others are there,\u2019 she thought, \u2018I may as\n      well be there too,\u2019 and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her\n      sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night\n      with the goose.\n     \n      The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\n      without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it.\n      They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\n      wherever his legs took him.\n     \n      In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\n      procession he said: \u2018For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\n      running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?\u2019 At the\n      same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\n      but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\n      obliged to run behind.\n     \n      Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\n      behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: \u2018Hi! your\n      reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\n      christening today!\u2019 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\n      was also held fast to it.\n     \n      Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\n      came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and\n      begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had scarcely\n      touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of\n      them running behind Dummling and the goose.\n     \n      Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\n      who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth a\n      decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her.\n      When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before\n      the king\u2019s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on\n      and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if\n      she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife;\n      but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses\n      and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.\n      Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so\n      he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the\n      tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked\n      him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: \u2018I have such a\n      great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of\n      wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\u2019\n     \n      \u2018There, I can help you,\u2019 said Dummling, \u2018just come with me and you shall\n      be satisfied.\u2019\n     \n      He led him into the king\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels,\n      and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had\n      emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but\n      the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called\n      Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he\n      must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread. Dummling\n      did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same\n      place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making\n      an awful face, and saying: \u2018I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but\n      what good is that when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains\n      empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.\u2019\n     \n      At this Dummling was glad, and said: \u2018Get up and come with me; you shall\n      eat yourself full.\u2019 He led him to the king\u2019s palace where all the flour in\n      the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of\n      bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat,\n      and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished. Then Dummling\n      for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way\n      out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water. \u2018As soon as\n      you come sailing back in it,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall have my daughter for\n      wife.\u2019\n     \n      Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man\n      to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted, he\n      said: \u2018Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you the\n      ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.\u2019 Then he gave\n      him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king saw\n      that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The wedding\n      was celebrated, and after the king\u2019s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom\n      and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\n    ",
        "\n      Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\n      off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill\u2014so ill\n      that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved at\n      their father\u2019s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully\n      in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was\n      the matter. They told him that their father was very ill, and that they\n      were afraid nothing could save him. \u2018I know what would,\u2019 said the little\n      old man; \u2018it is the Water of Life. If he could have a draught of it he\n      would be well again; but it is very hard to get.\u2019 Then the eldest son\n      said, \u2018I will soon find it\u2019: and he went to the sick king, and begged that\n      he might go in search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that\n      could save him. \u2018No,\u2019 said the king. \u2018I had rather die than place you in\n      such great danger as you must meet with in your journey.\u2019 But he begged so\n      hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself, \u2018If I\n      bring my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.\u2019\n     \n      Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\n      deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\n      saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\n      sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\n      \u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018What is that to thee, you ugly imp?\u2019 said the\n      prince haughtily, and rode on.\n     \n      But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of\n      ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower\n      and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go\n      to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go\n      back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found\n      that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. He\n      next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the\n      laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and\n      thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\n     \n      Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\u2019s return,\n      till at last the second son said, \u2018Father, I will go in search of the\n      Water of Life.\u2019 For he thought to himself, \u2018My brother is surely dead, and\n      the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\u2019 The king was at first\n      very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish. So he set\n      out and followed the same road which his brother had done, and met with\n      the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying,\n      as before, \u2018Prince, prince, whither so fast?\u2019 \u2018Mind your own affairs,\n      busybody!\u2019 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\n     \n      But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother,\n      and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the\n      mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above\n      everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\n     \n      When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\n      said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\n      soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\n      met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and said,\n      \u2018Prince, whither so fast?\u2019 And the prince said, \u2018I am going in search of\n      the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help\n      me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!\u2019 \u2018Do you know where it is to be\n      found?\u2019 asked the dwarf. \u2018No,\u2019 said the prince, \u2018I do not. Pray tell me if\n      you know.\u2019 \u2018Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to\n      seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. The water you seek\n      springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to\n      reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of\n      bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and\n      it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their\n      prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten\n      on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock\n      strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for\n      ever.\u2019\n     \n      Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\n      friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and\n      on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey\u2019s end, and found\n      everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at the\n      third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\n      through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\n      saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\n      and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a sword\n      and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a room\n      where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\n      joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\n      her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry\n      her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life was in\n      the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted\n      before the clock struck twelve.\n     \n      He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\n      delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\n      as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the\n      lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep fell upon him\n      unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter\n      to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the\n      well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to\n      get away in time. Just as he was going out of the iron door it struck\n      twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece\n      of his heel.\n     \n      When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got the\n      Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed by the\n      little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, \u2018You have\n      made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies,\n      and the bread will never fail you.\u2019 Then the prince thought to himself, \u2018I\n      cannot go home to my father without my brothers\u2019; so he said, \u2018My dear\n      friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in\n      search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?\u2019 \u2018I have shut\n      them up by a charm between two mountains,\u2019 said the dwarf, \u2018because they\n      were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.\u2019 The prince begged\n      so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though\n      unwillingly, saying, \u2018Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.\u2019 Their\n      brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that\n      had happened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a\n      cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell\n      that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to\n      marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\n     \n      Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\n      country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\n      feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land the\n      bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the wonderful\n      sword, and he slew the enemy\u2019s army with it; and thus the kingdom was once\n      more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he befriended two other\n      countries through which they passed on their way.\n     \n      When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\n      the two eldest said to themselves, \u2018Our brother has got the water which we\n      could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\n      kingdom, which is our right\u2019; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\n      agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was fast\n      asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for\n      themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\n     \n      When they came to their journey\u2019s end, the youngest son brought his cup to\n      the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however, had\n      he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\n      before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for\n      what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but\n      that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them. He no\n      sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness\n      leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days. Then they\n      went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \u2018Well, brother, you\n      found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble and we shall\n      have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to\n      keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your beautiful\n      princess, if you do not take care. You had better say nothing about this\n      to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell\n      tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we\n      will let you off.\u2019\n     \n      The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that\n      he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\n      together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\n      be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\n      day, when the king\u2019s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they were\n      alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the\n      prince said, \u2018My friend, what is the matter with you?\u2019 \u2018I cannot and dare\n      not tell you,\u2019 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said, \u2018Only\n      tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will forgive\n      you.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said the huntsman; \u2018the king has ordered me to shoot you.\u2019\n      The prince started at this, and said, \u2018Let me live, and I will change\n      dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father, and\n      do you give me your shabby one.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the huntsman;\n      \u2018I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.\u2019\n      Then he took the prince\u2019s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away\n      through the wood.\n     \n      Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\u2019s court, with\n      rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now all these\n      were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of\n      bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their people. This\n      touched the old king\u2019s heart, and he thought his son might still be\n      guiltless, and said to his court, \u2018O that my son were still alive! how it\n      grieves me that I had him killed!\u2019 \u2018He is still alive,\u2019 said the huntsman;\n      \u2018and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and\n      brought home his royal coat.\u2019 At this the king was overwhelmed with joy,\n      and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come\n      back to his court he would forgive him.\n     \n      Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come\n      back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold;\n      and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight\n      up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in:\n      but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right\n      one; and that they must send him away at once.\n     \n      The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\n      haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set her\n      free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her.\n      As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to look\n      at it, and he thought to himself, \u2018It is a pity to ride upon this\n      beautiful road\u2019; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of it.\n      But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he took,\n      said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go about his\n      business.\n     \n      The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he\n      came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he\n      stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself,\n      \u2018What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\u2019 Then he too turned\n      aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to the gate the\n      guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too must go away about\n      his business; and away he went.\n     \n      Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\n      in which he had lain hid for fear of his father\u2019s anger, and set out in\n      search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the\n      way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made\n      of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate\n      it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her\n      deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom. When the\n      first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told him she had heard\n      of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again:\n      so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father,\n      taking her with him. Then he told him everything; how his brothers had\n      cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the\n      love of his father. And the old king was very angry, and wanted to punish\n      his wicked sons; but they made their escape, and got into a ship and\n      sailed away over the wide sea, and where they went to nobody knew and\n      nobody cared.\n     \n      And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\n      kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess. And\n      young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the\n      summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf\n      hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a king\u2019s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\n      when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\n      lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\n      Then he said to his beloved: \u2018I must now go and leave you, I give you a\n      ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch you.\u2019\n      So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\n      dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \u2018Dear son, I wished\n      to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\u2019 and\n      he named a certain king\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in\n      such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \u2018Yes, dear\n      father, your will shall be done,\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his eyes,\n      and died.\n     \n      When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning\n      was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father,\n      and caused the king\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was\n      promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much\n      about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her:\n      \u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatsoever you will.\u2019\n      She thought for a moment and said: \u2018Dear father, I wish for eleven girls\n      exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\u2019 The father said: \u2018If it be\n      possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\u2019 and he caused a search to be\n      made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who\n      exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size.\n     \n      When they came to the king\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of huntsmen\u2019s\n      clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put on the\n      huntsmen\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she\n      took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the\n      court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. Then she asked if\n      he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his\n      service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but as they were\n      such handsome fellows, he said: \u2018Yes,\u2019 and that he would willingly take\n      them, and now they were the king\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\n     \n      The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew all\n      concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he said to\n      the king: \u2018You think you have twelve huntsmen?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the king,\n      \u2018they are twelve huntsmen.\u2019 The lion continued: \u2018You are mistaken, they\n      are twelve girls.\u2019 The king said: \u2018That cannot be true! How will you prove\n      that to me?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber,\u2019\n      answered the lion, \u2018and then you will soon see. Men have a firm step, and\n      when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and\n      drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\u2019 The king was well pleased with\n      the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\n     \n      There was, however, a servant of the king\u2019s who favoured the huntsmen, and\n      when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to them\n      and repeated everything, and said: \u2018The lion wants to make the king\n      believe that you are girls.\u2019 Then the king\u2019s daughter thanked him, and\n      said to her maidens: \u2018Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\u2019 So\n      next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and\n      they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so\n      firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas\n      either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said to\n      the lion: \u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like men.\u2019 The lion said:\n      \u2018They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and\n      have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought\n      into the ante-chamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them,\n      and that is what no man would do.\u2019 The king liked the advice, and had the\n      spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.\n     \n      But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and\n      disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\u2019s daughter said to\n      her eleven girls: \u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round at the\n      spinning-wheels.\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen\n      summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the\n      spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion: \u2018You have deceived\n      me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\u2019 The\n      lion replied: \u2018They have restrained themselves.\u2019 The king, however, would\n      no longer believe the lion.\n     \n      The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his liking\n      for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once when they\n      were out hunting, news came that the king\u2019s bride was approaching. When\n      the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that her heart was almost\n      broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something\n      had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and\n      drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which he had given to his first\n      bride, and when he looked in her face he recognized her. Then his heart\n      was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said:\n      \u2018You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.\u2019 He\n      sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her\n      own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an\n      old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated,\n      and the lion was again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told\n      the truth.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\n      young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\n      making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in\n      the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost.\n      Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing\n      was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an\n      evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.\n     \n      One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great\n      comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all\n      on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf.\n      \u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\u2019 said he to the merchant; \u2018what is it\n      you take so deeply to heart?\u2019 \u2018If you would do me any good I would\n      willingly tell you,\u2019 said the merchant. \u2018Who knows but I may?\u2019 said the\n      little man: \u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of\n      some use.\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the\n      bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of\n      land. \u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\u2019 said the dwarf; \u2018only\n      undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first\n      on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.\u2019 The\n      merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely\n      be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little\n      boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to\n      do what was asked of him.\n     \n      But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\n      crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his\n      face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror,\n      and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was\n      come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the\n      dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he\n      should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\n     \n      About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for\n      some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there,\n      instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At\n      the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went\n      into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.\n     \n      Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\n      near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and\n      thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy\n      one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some\n      time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him\n      for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years\n      were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, \u2018Father,\n      give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the\n      little man.\u2019\n     \n      When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\n      agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and\n      his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and\n      walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get\n      into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the\n      boy said to him. \u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do\n      you want?\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of\n      him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was\n      in store for him. \u2018Have you brought me what you said you would?\u2019 said the\n      dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again,\n      \u2018What do you want here?\u2019 The dwarf said, \u2018I come to talk with your father,\n      not with you.\u2019 \u2018You have cheated and taken in my father,\u2019 said the son;\n      \u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\u2019 \u2018Fair and softly,\u2019 said the little\n      old man; \u2018right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had\n      it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.\u2019\n      \u2018You must have my consent to that first,\u2019 said Heinel, \u2018so please to step\n      in here, and let us talk it over.\u2019 The old man grinned, and showed his\n      teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he\n      could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed\n      that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have\n      his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune\n      was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose\n      to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his\n      company.\n     \n      So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\n      Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by;\n      that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should\n      thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather.\n      Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before\n      it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the\n      water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home\n      very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he\n      had had his revenge.\n     \n      The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\n      friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\n      young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\n      land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but\n      empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \u2018Here,\u2019 said he to himself,\n      \u2018must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\u2019 So he once more\n      searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake,\n      lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\n     \n      Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to\n      see him, and said, \u2018Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years\n      have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for\n      you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will\n      be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you\n      do here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will\u2014beat,\n      whip, pinch, prick, or torment you\u2014bear all; only speak not a word,\n      and at twelve o\u2019clock they must go away. The second night twelve others\n      will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your\n      head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I\n      shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will\n      wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.\u2019 And all came to\n      pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third\n      night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and\n      gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated,\n      and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.\n     \n      They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight\n      years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father;\n      and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was against his\n      going, and said, \u2018I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you\n      go.\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she\n      gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \u2018Take this ring, and put it on your\n      finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make\n      use of it to bring me hence to your father\u2019s house.\u2019 Then he said he would\n      do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near\n      the town where his father lived.\n     \n      Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not\n      let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\n      neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and\n      thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\u2019s house, he\n      said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he\n      had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and\n      as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him\n      anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and\n      said, \u2018Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your\n      son?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said his mother, \u2018our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on\n      his right arm.\u2019 Then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he\n      had said was true.\n     \n      He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married\n      to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, \u2018that\n      can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a\n      shepherd\u2019s frock!\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word,\n      turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they\n      stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and\n      bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last\n      seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking\n      how she should punish him.\n     \n      One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the\n      spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\n      himself down, and said, \u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\n      head in your lap, and sleep a while.\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\n      however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\n      wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he\n      found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. \u2018I\n      can never go back to my father\u2019s house,\u2019 said he; \u2018they would say I am a\n      sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my\n      kingdom.\u2019\n     \n      So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\n      giants were sharing their father\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they\n      cried out and said, \u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\n      between us.\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\u2019s head whenever\n      the wearer gave the words, \u2018Heads off!\u2019; a cloak that made the owner\n      invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\n      carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him\n      try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon\n      them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a\n      moment he was a fly. \u2018The cloak is very well,\u2019 said he: \u2018now give me the\n      sword.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said they; \u2018not unless you undertake not to say, \u201cHeads\n      off!\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\u2019 So they gave it him, charging\n      him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment\n      he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain;\n      and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to\n      share or quarrel about.\n     \n      As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the\n      people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband.\n      Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall,\n      and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But\n      when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it\n      himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank\n      it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and\n      cup were always empty.\n     \n      Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\n      alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \u2018Alas!\u2019 said she\n      to herself, \u2018was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still\n      seem to bind me?\u2019\n     \n      \u2018False and fickle one!\u2019 said he. \u2018One indeed came who set thee free, and\n      he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had\n      such treatment from thee?\u2019 Then he went out and sent away the company, and\n      said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom.\n      But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would\n      enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in\n      peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he\n      drew his sword. \u2018Heads Off!\u2019 cried he; and with the word the traitors\u2019\n      heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden\n      Mountain.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two\n      oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two talers.\n      When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the\n      doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he ate and\n      drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly have been a\n      doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he\n      too could not be a doctor. \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said the doctor, \u2018that is soon\n      managed.\u2019 \u2018What must I do?\u2019 asked the peasant. \u2018In the first place buy\n      yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece;\n      in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into money, and get\n      yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly,\n      have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \u201cI am Doctor Knowall,\u201d\n       and have that nailed up above your house-door.\u2019 The peasant did everything\n      that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not\n      long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about\n      Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what\n      had become of the money. So the lord had the horses harnessed to his\n      carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor\n      Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back\n      the stolen money. \u2018Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.\u2019 The lord was\n      willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all\n      drove away together. When they came to the nobleman\u2019s castle, the table\n      was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. \u2018Yes, but my wife,\n      Grete, too,\u2019 said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And\n      when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant\n      nudged his wife, and said: \u2018Grete, that was the first,\u2019 meaning that was\n      the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he\n      intended by that to say: \u2018That is the first thief,\u2019 and as he actually was\n      so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: \u2018The doctor knows\n      all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.\u2019 The second did not want\n      to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the\n      peasant nudged his wife, and said: \u2018Grete, that is the second.\u2019 This\n      servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third\n      fared no better, for the peasant again said: \u2018Grete, that is the third.\u2019\n      The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the\n      doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the\n      cover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no\n      idea what to say, and cried: \u2018Ah, poor Crabb.\u2019 When the lord heard that,\n      he cried: \u2018There! he knows it; he must also know who has the money!\u2019\n     \n      On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor\n      that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went\n      out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and\n      said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into\n      the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be\n      hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this\n      the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table,\n      and said: \u2018My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is\n      hidden.\u2019 The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the\n      doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still and opened his A B C\n      book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As\n      he could not find it immediately he said: \u2018I know you are there, so you\n      had better come out!\u2019 Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor\n      meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: \u2018That man knows\n      everything!\u2019 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but\n      did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in\n      reward, and became a renowned man.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\n      Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\n      they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\n      christened.\n     \n      So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\n      water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at drawing\n      the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers\n      fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another,\n      and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the meantime the\n      father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the young men stay so\n      long. \u2018Surely,\u2019 said he, \u2018the whole seven must have forgotten themselves\n      over some game of play\u2019; and when he had waited still longer and they yet\n      did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens.\n      Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head,\n      and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and\n      round. Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how\n      what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could\n      for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon\n      became stronger and every day more beautiful.\n     \n      For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\n      her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\n      day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said\n      they, \u2018she is beautiful indeed, but still \u2018tis a pity that her brothers\n      should have been lost for her sake.\u2019 Then she was much grieved, and went\n      to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had\n      become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said\n      it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause\n      of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought\n      herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had\n      neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out\n      into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free\n      them, whatever it might cost her.\n     \n      She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\n      had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\n      pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest\n      upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and journeyed till\n      she came to the world\u2019s end; then she came to the sun, but the sun looked\n      much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to the moon, but the moon\n      was cold and chilly, and said, \u2018I smell flesh and blood this way!\u2019 so she\n      took herself away in a hurry and came to the stars, and the stars were\n      friendly and kind to her, and each star sat upon his own little stool; but\n      the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, and said,\n      \u2018If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle\n      that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.\u2019 The\n      little girl took the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and\n      went on again until she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door\n      shut. Then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped\n      the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good\n      stars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had no\n      key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister\n      took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was\n      just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door\n      and opened it.\n     \n      As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, \u2018What are you\n      seeking for?\u2019 \u2018I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,\u2019 answered she.\n      Then the dwarf said, \u2018My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\n      till they come, pray step in.\u2019 Now the little dwarf was getting their\n      dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\n      their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and out\n      of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\n      little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\n      brought with her fall into the last glass.\n     \n      On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the dwarf\n      said, \u2018Here come my masters.\u2019 When they came in, they wanted to eat and\n      drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after\n      the other,\n     \n      \u2018Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\n      little glass?\u2019\n     \n      When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\n      ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s, and\n      said, \u2018O that our little sister would but come! then we should be free.\u2019\n      When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the\n      time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took\n      their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went\n      merrily home.\n    ",
        "\n      FIRST STORY\n     \n      There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\n      his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\n      stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as\n      if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and\n      her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became\n      known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves. The maid\n      heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened\n      it, and it was a young fox, who said:\n     \n      She answered:\n     \n      \u2018No, thank you, miss,\u2019 said the fox, \u2018what is Mrs Fox doing?\u2019 The maid\n      replied:\n     \n      \u2018Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\n      her.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, young sir.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 answered\n      the cat, \u2018he has only one.\u2019 \u2018Then I will not have him.\u2019\n     \n      Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\n      was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\n      Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\n      this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\n      were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old\n      Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\n     \n      But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\n      under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs Fox\n      out of the house.\n     \n      SECOND STORY\n     \n      When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\n      door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The wolf\n      greeted her, and said:\n     \n      The cat replied:\n     \n      \u2018No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\u2019 answered the wolf. \u2018Is Mrs Fox not at home?\u2019\n     \n      The cat said:\n     \n      The wolf answered:\n     \n      Mrs Fox asked: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\n      mouth?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 answered the cat. \u2018Then he won\u2019t do for me.\u2019\n     \n      When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\n      all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\n      qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat\n      had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young fox. Then\n      Mrs Fox said: \u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little\n      pointed mouth?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018he has.\u2019 \u2018Then let him come\n      upstairs,\u2019 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\n      feast.\n     \n      Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\n      rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\n      still.\n    ",
        "\n      As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\n      there came up a little old woman, and said to him, \u2018Good day, good day;\n      you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\n      something to eat.\u2019 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his\n      pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but she\n      took hold of him, and said, \u2018Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell\n      you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little\n      time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a\n      cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the\n      cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it\n      you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be. Cut open the\n      dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of\n      gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It is the bird\u2019s heart\n      that will bring you this good luck.\u2019\n     \n      The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \u2018If all this does\n      happen, it will be a fine thing for me.\u2019 When he had gone a hundred steps\n      or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and\n      looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and\n      feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to\n      have it himself. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the huntsman, \u2018this is wonderful; this\n      happens just as the old woman said\u2019; then he shot into the midst of them\n      so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the flock chattering away;\n      but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it. Then the huntsman did as\n      the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took out the heart, and carried\n      the cloak home with him.\n     \n      The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay the\n      piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\n      indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and at\n      last thought to himself, \u2018Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am at\n      home? I will go out into the world and look about me.\u2019\n     \n      Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\n      neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through a\n      thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and\n      at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady\n      by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and said to\n      the young lady, \u2018There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a\n      wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is\n      more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\u2019s heart that brings a piece of\n      gold under his pillow every morning.\u2019 Meantime the huntsman came nearer\n      and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \u2018I have been travelling so\n      long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have\n      money enough to pay for anything I want\u2019; but the real reason was, that he\n      wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and\n      was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love\n      that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady\u2019s eyes, and doing\n      everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, \u2018Now is the time for\n      getting the bird\u2019s heart.\u2019 So the lady stole it away, and he never found\n      any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the young lady\u2019s, and\n      the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that\n      he never missed his prize.\n     \n      \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old witch, \u2018we have got the bird\u2019s heart, but not the\n      wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\u2019 \u2018Let us leave him that,\u2019\n      said the young lady; \u2018he has already lost his wealth.\u2019 Then the witch was\n      very angry, and said, \u2018Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing,\n      and I must and will have it.\u2019 So she did as the old woman told her, and\n      set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very\n      sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \u2018What makes you so sad?\u2019 \u2018Alas! dear\n      sir,\u2019 said she, \u2018yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly\n      diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it\n      I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and\n      the flies\u2014man cannot.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s all your grief,\u2019 said the\n      huntsman, \u2018I\u2019ll take you there with all my heart\u2019; so he drew her under his\n      cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were\n      both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\n      delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch made\n      a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \u2018Let us sit\n      down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any\n      longer.\u2019 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell\n      asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his\n      shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself\n      home again.\n     \n      When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone\n      on the wild rock, he said, \u2018Alas! what roguery there is in the world!\u2019 and\n      there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do. Now this\n      rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of\n      them striding about, he thought to himself, \u2018I can only save myself by\n      feigning to be asleep\u2019; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound\n      sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot,\n      and said, \u2018What worm is this that lies here curled up?\u2019 \u2018Tread upon him\n      and kill him,\u2019 said the second. \u2018It\u2019s not worth the trouble,\u2019 said the\n      third; \u2018let him live, he\u2019ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some\n      cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\u2019 And they passed on. But the\n      huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they were gone, he\n      climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat there a short time\n      a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore\n      him along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite\n      gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\n     \n      Then he looked around him, and said, \u2018I wish I had something to eat, if\n      not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples nor\n      pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\u2019 At last he thought\n      to himself, \u2018I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen me.\u2019 So he\n      picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two\n      bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with horror that he was\n      turned into an ass. However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad\n      tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and\n      scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and\n      soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.\n     \n      Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\n      when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\n      the bad salad, and thought to himself, \u2018This will help me to my fortune\n      again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\u2019 So he\n      went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\n      about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\n      brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into the\n      castle and asked for a lodging; \u2018I am so tired,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I can go\n      no farther.\u2019 \u2018Countryman,\u2019 said the witch, \u2018who are you? and what is your\n      business?\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 said he, \u2018a messenger sent by the king to find the\n      finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky enough to find\n      it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that\n      it begins to wither, and I don\u2019t know that I can carry it farther.\u2019\n     \n      When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\n      longed to taste it, and said, \u2018Dear countryman, let us just taste it.\u2019 \u2018To\n      be sure,\u2019 answered he; \u2018I have two heads of it with me, and will give you\n      one\u2019; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself\n      took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could\n      not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves immediately and put\n      them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own\n      form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass. Now the\n      servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going\n      to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old\n      woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass\n      and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the\n      ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and\n      as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, \u2018I\n      don\u2019t know where the salad can be.\u2019 Then he thought something must have\n      happened, and said, \u2018I will go into the kitchen and see.\u2019 And as he went\n      he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the\n      ground. \u2018All right!\u2019 said he; \u2018those two have had their share.\u2019 Then he\n      took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to\n      the young lady, saying, \u2018I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait\n      any longer.\u2019 So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court\n      braying away.\n     \n      Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might\n      know him. \u2018Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\u2019 said he; and tied them\n      all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill\n      and knocked at the window. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 said the miller. \u2018I have\n      three tiresome beasts here,\u2019 said the other; \u2018if you will take them, give\n      them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever\n      you ask.\u2019 \u2018With all my heart,\u2019 said the miller; \u2018but how shall I treat\n      them?\u2019 Then the huntsman said, \u2018Give the old one stripes three times a day\n      and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day\n      and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady)\n      hay three times a day and no stripes\u2019: for he could not find it in his\n      heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle, where he\n      found everything he wanted.\n     \n      Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was\n      dead; \u2018The other two,\u2019 said he, \u2018are alive and eat, but are so sorrowful\n      that they cannot last long.\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them, and told the\n      miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he gave them some of\n      the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees\n      before him, and said, \u2018O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have\n      done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always\n      loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for\n      the bird\u2019s heart, I will give it you too.\u2019 But he said, \u2018Keep it, it will\n      be just the same thing, for I mean to make you my wife.\u2019 So they were\n      married, and lived together very happily till they died.\n    ",
        "\n      A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\n      and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\n      learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said: \u2018There\u2019s\n      a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\u2019 When anything had to be\n      done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father\n      bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the\n      way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered:\n      \u2018Oh, no father, I\u2019ll not go there, it makes me shudder!\u2019 for he was\n      afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the\n      flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \u2018Oh, it makes us shudder!\u2019 The\n      younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not\n      imagine what they could mean. \u2018They are always saying: \u201cIt makes me\n      shudder, it makes me shudder!\u201d It does not make me shudder,\u2019 thought he.\n      \u2018That, too, must be an art of which I understand nothing!\u2019\n     \n      Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \u2018Hearken to me,\n      you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\n      too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\n      brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\u2019 \u2018Well, father,\u2019 he\n      replied, \u2018I am quite willing to learn something\u2014indeed, if it could\n      but be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\u2019t understand\n      that at all yet.\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought\n      to himself: \u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! He will\n      never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a\n      sickle must bend himself betimes.\u2019\n     \n      The father sighed, and answered him: \u2018You shall soon learn what it is to\n      shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\u2019\n     \n      Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\n      bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in\n      every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \u2018Just think,\u2019 said\n      he, \u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually\n      wanted to learn to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that be all,\u2019 replied the sexton, \u2018he can\n      learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.\u2019 The\n      father was glad to do it, for he thought: \u2018It will train the boy a\n      little.\u2019 The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring\n      the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and\n      bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell. \u2018You\n      shall soon learn what shuddering is,\u2019 thought he, and secretly went there\n      before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round,\n      and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure\n      standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole. \u2018Who is there?\u2019 cried\n      he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir. \u2018Give an\n      answer,\u2019 cried the boy, \u2018or take yourself off, you have no business here\n      at night.\u2019\n     \n      The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think\n      he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \u2018What do you want here?\u2014speak\n      if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!\u2019 The\n      sexton thought: \u2018He can\u2019t mean to be as bad as his words,\u2019 uttered no\n      sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy called to him\n      for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him\n      and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps\n      and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he rang the bell, went\n      home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton\u2019s\n      wife waited a long time for her husband, but he did not come back. At\n      length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: \u2018Do you know\n      where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t\n      know,\u2019 replied the boy, \u2018but someone was standing by the sounding hole on\n      the other side of the steps, and as he would neither give an answer nor go\n      away, I took him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there\n      and you will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.\u2019 The woman\n      ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and\n      had broken his leg.\n     \n      She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy\u2019s\n      father, \u2018Your boy,\u2019 cried she, \u2018has been the cause of a great misfortune!\n      He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg. Take the\n      good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\u2019 The father was terrified, and\n      ran thither and scolded the boy. \u2018What wicked tricks are these?\u2019 said he.\n      \u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 he replied, \u2018do\n      listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one\n      intent on doing evil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three\n      times either to speak or to go away.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the father, \u2018I have\n      nothing but unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no\n      more.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I go\n      forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate, understand\n      one art which will support me.\u2019 \u2018Learn what you will,\u2019 spoke the father,\n      \u2018it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you. Take these and\n      go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you come, and who is\n      your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\u2019 \u2018Yes, father, it\n      shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily\n      keep it in mind.\u2019\n     \n      When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\n      pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\n      himself: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 Then a man\n      approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\n      himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see\n      the gallows, the man said to him: \u2018Look, there is the tree where seven men\n      have married the ropemaker\u2019s daughter, and are now learning how to fly.\n      Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn\n      how to shudder.\u2019 \u2018If that is all that is wanted,\u2019 answered the youth, \u2018it\n      is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as that, you shall\n      have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the morning.\u2019 Then the\n      youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and waited till evening\n      came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the\n      wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And\n      as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved\n      backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: \u2018If you shiver below by the\n      fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!\u2019 And as he felt pity for\n      them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the\n      other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and\n      set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there and did not\n      stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: \u2018Take care, or I will\n      hang you up again.\u2019 The dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite\n      silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said:\n      \u2018If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with\n      you,\u2019 and he hung them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his\n      fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted\n      to have the fifty talers, and said: \u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\u2019\n      \u2018No,\u2019 answered he, \u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\n      their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they\n      had on their bodies get burnt.\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not get the\n      fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \u2018Such a youth has never come\n      my way before.\u2019\n     \n      The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to himself:\n      \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019 A waggoner who\n      was striding behind him heard this and asked: \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t\n      know,\u2019 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \u2018From whence do you\n      come?\u2019 \u2018I know not.\u2019 \u2018Who is your father?\u2019 \u2018That I may not tell you.\u2019\n      \u2018What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019\n      replied the youth, \u2018I do so wish I could shudder, but no one can teach me\n      how.\u2019 \u2018Enough of your foolish chatter,\u2019 said the waggoner. \u2018Come, go with\n      me, I will see about a place for you.\u2019 The youth went with the waggoner,\n      and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the\n      night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite\n      loudly: \u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\u2019 The host who\n      heard this, laughed and said: \u2018If that is your desire, there ought to be a\n      good opportunity for you here.\u2019 \u2018Ah, be silent,\u2019 said the hostess, \u2018so\n      many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and\n      a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight\n      again.\u2019\n     \n      But the youth said: \u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\n      this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\u2019 He let the host have no rest,\n      until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle\n      where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but\n      watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that he who would\n      venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the most beautiful\n      maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which\n      were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and\n      would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the\n      castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next\n      morning to the king, and said: \u2018If it be allowed, I will willingly watch\n      three nights in the haunted castle.\u2019\n     \n      The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \u2018You may\n      ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must be\n      things without life.\u2019 Then he answered: \u2018Then I ask for a fire, a turning\n      lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\u2019\n     \n      The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day.\n      When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a bright\n      fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife beside it,\n      and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \u2018Ah, if I could but shudder!\u2019\n      said he, \u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\u2019 Towards midnight he was\n      about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly\n      from one corner: \u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\u2019 \u2018You fools!\u2019 cried he, \u2018what\n      are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire\n      and warm yourselves.\u2019 And when he had said that, two great black cats came\n      with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked\n      savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when they had\n      warmed themselves, they said: \u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\u2019\n      \u2018Why not?\u2019 he replied, \u2018but just show me your paws.\u2019 Then they stretched\n      out their claws. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must\n      first cut them for you.\u2019 Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them\n      on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. \u2018I have looked at your\n      fingers,\u2019 said he, \u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\u2019 and he struck\n      them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had made away\n      with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from\n      every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains,\n      and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they\n      yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to\n      put it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they\n      were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \u2018Away with\n      you, vermin,\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the\n      others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he\n      fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus\n      sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.\n      Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \u2018That is the very\n      thing for me,\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut\n      his eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\n      the whole of the castle. \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 said he, \u2018but go faster.\u2019 Then\n      the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over\n      thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down,\n      and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the\n      air, got out and said: \u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\u2019 and lay down by\n      his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and\n      when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits had\n      killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \u2018After all it is a pity,\u2014for\n      so handsome a man.\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \u2018It has not come\n      to that yet.\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad, and asked how\n      he had fared. \u2018Very well indeed,\u2019 answered he; \u2018one night is past, the two\n      others will pass likewise.\u2019 Then he went to the innkeeper, who opened his\n      eyes very wide, and said: \u2018I never expected to see you alive again! Have\n      you learnt how to shudder yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018it is all in vain. If\n      someone would but tell me!\u2019\n     \n      The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\n      fire, and once more began his old song: \u2018If I could but shudder!\u2019 When\n      midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first\n      it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for a while,\n      and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and\n      fell before him. \u2018Hullo!\u2019 cried he, \u2018another half belongs to this. This is\n      not enough!\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling,\n      and the other half fell down likewise. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will just stoke\n      up the fire a little for you.\u2019 When he had done that and looked round\n      again, the two pieces were joined together, and a hideous man was sitting\n      in his place. \u2018That is no part of our bargain,\u2019 said the youth, \u2018the bench\n      is mine.\u2019 The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not\n      allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself\n      again in his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the\n      other; they brought nine dead men\u2019s legs and two skulls, and set them up\n      and played at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play and said:\n      \u2018Listen you, can I join you?\u2019 \u2018Yes, if you have any money.\u2019 \u2018Money\n      enough,\u2019 replied he, \u2018but your balls are not quite round.\u2019 Then he took\n      the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round.\n      \u2018There, now they will roll better!\u2019 said he. \u2018Hurrah! now we\u2019ll have fun!\u2019\n      He played with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck twelve,\n      everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep.\n      Next morning the king came to inquire after him. \u2018How has it fared with\n      you this time?\u2019 asked he. \u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\u2019 he answered,\n      \u2018and have lost a couple of farthings.\u2019 \u2018Have you not shuddered then?\u2019\n      \u2018What?\u2019 said he, \u2018I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it\n      was to shudder!\u2019\n     \n      The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: \u2018If I\n      could but shudder.\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a\n      coffin. Then he said: \u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little cousin, who\n      died only a few days ago,\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger, and cried:\n      \u2018Come, little cousin, come.\u2019 They placed the coffin on the ground, but he\n      went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay therein. He felt his\n      face, but it was cold as ice. \u2018Wait,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will warm you a little,\u2019\n      and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man\u2019s\n      face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire\n      and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might\n      circulate again. As this also did no good, he thought to himself: \u2018When\n      two people lie in bed together, they warm each other,\u2019 and carried him to\n      the bed, covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead\n      man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth, \u2018See, little\n      cousin, have I not warmed you?\u2019 The dead man, however, got up and cried:\n      \u2018Now will I strangle you.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018What!\u2019 said he, \u2018is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go into\n      your coffin again,\u2019 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the\n      lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \u2018I cannot manage to\n      shudder,\u2019 said he. \u2018I shall never learn it here as long as I live.\u2019\n     \n      Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. He\n      was old, however, and had a long white beard. \u2018You wretch,\u2019 cried he, \u2018you\n      shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\u2019 \u2018Not so fast,\u2019\n      replied the youth. \u2018If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.\u2019 \u2018I\n      will soon seize you,\u2019 said the fiend. \u2018Softly, softly, do not talk so big.\n      I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\u2019 \u2018We shall see,\u2019\n      said the old man. \u2018If you are stronger, I will let you go\u2014come, we\n      will try.\u2019 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\u2019s forge, took an\n      axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground. \u2018I can do better\n      than that,\u2019 said the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man\n      placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down.\n      Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it\n      caught the old man\u2019s beard. \u2018Now I have you,\u2019 said the youth. \u2018Now it is\n      your turn to die.\u2019 Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he\n      moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches. The\n      youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the\n      castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. \u2018Of these,\u2019\n      said he, \u2018one part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third\n      yours.\u2019 In the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so\n      that the youth stood in darkness. \u2018I shall still be able to find my way\n      out,\u2019 said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept\n      there by his fire. Next morning the king came and said: \u2018Now you must have\n      learnt what shuddering is?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 he answered; \u2018what can it be? My dead\n      cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of\n      money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 said\n      the king, \u2018you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\u2019 \u2018That\n      is all very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018but still I do not know what it is to\n      shudder!\u2019\n     \n      Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\n      much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\n      said always: \u2018If I could but shudder\u2014if I could but shudder.\u2019 And\n      this at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \u2018I will find a cure for\n      him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\u2019 She went out to the\n      stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of\n      gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his\n      wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold\n      water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\n      sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \u2018Oh, what makes me shudder\n      so?\u2014what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is\n      to shudder!\u2019\n    ",
        "\n      A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\n      beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\n      princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\n      only made sport of them.\n     \n      Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her\n      suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank\u2014kings,\n      and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights.\n      Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something\n      spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \u2018He\u2019s as round as a\n      tub,\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \u2018What a maypole!\u2019 said she. The\n      next was too short: \u2018What a dumpling!\u2019 said she. The fourth was too pale,\n      and she called him \u2018Wallface.\u2019 The fifth was too red, so she called him\n      \u2018Coxcomb.\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a\n      green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker\u2019s oven. And thus she\n      had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a\n      good king who was there. \u2018Look at him,\u2019 said she; \u2018his beard is like an\n      old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.\u2019 So the king got the nickname of\n      Grisly-beard.\n     \n      But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and\n      how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\n      unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\n      came to the door.\n     \n      Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under\n      the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, \u2018Let him\n      come in.\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung\n      before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said,\n      \u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.\u2019\n      The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \u2018I have sworn to give\n      you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\u2019 So words and tears were\n      of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler.\n      When this was over the king said, \u2018Now get ready to go\u2014you must not\n      stay here\u2014you must travel on with your husband.\u2019\n     \n      Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\n      to a great wood. \u2018Pray,\u2019 said she, \u2018whose is this wood?\u2019 \u2018It belongs to\n      King Grisly-beard,\u2019 answered he; \u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018would that I had\n      married King Grisly-beard!\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \u2018Whose\n      are these beautiful green meadows?\u2019 said she. \u2018They belong to King\n      Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! unlucky\n      wretch that I am!\u2019 said she; \u2018would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\u2019\n     \n      Then they came to a great city. \u2018Whose is this noble city?\u2019 said she. \u2018It\n      belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\n      thine.\u2019 \u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\u2019 sighed she; \u2018why did I not marry King\n      Grisly-beard?\u2019 \u2018That is no business of mine,\u2019 said the fiddler: \u2018why\n      should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\u2019\n     \n      At last they came to a small cottage. \u2018What a paltry place!\u2019 said she; \u2018to\n      whom does that little dirty hole belong?\u2019 Then the fiddler said, \u2018That is\n      your and my house, where we are to live.\u2019 \u2018Where are your servants?\u2019 cried\n      she. \u2018What do we want with servants?\u2019 said he; \u2018you must do for yourself\n      whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my\n      supper, for I am very tired.\u2019 But the princess knew nothing of making\n      fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had\n      eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up\n      very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two\n      days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man\n      said, \u2018Wife, we can\u2019t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You\n      must learn to weave baskets.\u2019 Then he went out and cut willows, and\n      brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very\n      sore. \u2018I see this work won\u2019t do,\u2019 said he: \u2018try and spin; perhaps you will\n      do that better.\u2019 So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut\n      her tender fingers till the blood ran. \u2018See now,\u2019 said the fiddler, \u2018you\n      are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!\n      However, I\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand\n      in the market and sell them.\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 sighed she, \u2018if any of my father\u2019s\n      court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will\n      laugh at me!\u2019\n     \n      But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did\n      not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people,\n      seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money\n      without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as\n      it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat\n      herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier\n      soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her\n      goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to\n      do. \u2018Ah! what will become of me?\u2019 said she; \u2018what will my husband say?\u2019 So\n      she ran home and told him all. \u2018Who would have thought you would have been\n      so silly,\u2019 said he, \u2018as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the\n      market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you\n      are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king\u2019s palace,\n      and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take\n      you, and there you will have plenty to eat.\u2019\n     \n      Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the\n      dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was\n      left, and on this they lived.\n     \n      She had not been there long before she heard that the king\u2019s eldest son\n      was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\n      and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\n      the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\n      which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\n      meats, which she put into her basket to take home.\n     \n      All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\u2019s son in golden\n      clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the\n      hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled\n      for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport\n      of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the\n      basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody\n      laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself\n      a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but\n      on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and\n      said, \u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I\n      brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that\n      overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly\n      pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is\n      over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.\u2019\n     \n      Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\n      her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\n      on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\n      grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and\n      I had been of the party.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace,\n      full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot\n      him a roe, but he did not come back. \u2018Perhaps some accident has befallen\n      him,\u2019 said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who\n      were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day,\n      he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \u2018Scour the whole forest through,\n      and do not give up until you have found all three.\u2019 But of these also,\n      none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one\n      would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep\n      stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle\n      or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when an unknown\n      huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered\n      to go into the dangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his\n      consent, and said: \u2018It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you\n      no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.\u2019 The\n      huntsman replied: \u2018Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know\n      nothing.\u2019\n     \n      The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\n      not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\n      pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\n      deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\n      the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\n      went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\n      water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\n      was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\n      knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\n      was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\n      in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on\n      pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping.\n      And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with\n      safety.\n     \n      The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard,\n      and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran\n      thither and said: \u2018Give me my ball out.\u2019 \u2018Not till you have opened the\n      door for me,\u2019 answered the man. \u2018No,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018I will not do that;\n      the king has forbidden it,\u2019 and ran away. The next day he again went and\n      asked for his ball; the wild man said: \u2018Open my door,\u2019 but the boy would\n      not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went\n      once more and said: \u2018I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have\n      not the key.\u2019 Then the wild man said: \u2018It lies under your mother\u2019s pillow,\n      you can get it there.\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all\n      thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with\n      difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man\n      stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had\n      become afraid; he called and cried after him: \u2018Oh, wild man, do not go\n      away, or I shall be beaten!\u2019 The wild man turned back, took him up, set\n      him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the\n      king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that\n      had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was\n      gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to\n      seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could\n      easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\n     \n      When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\n      down from his shoulder, and said to him: \u2018You will never see your father\n      and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\n      and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\n      well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\n      world.\u2019 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next\n      morning the man took him to a well, and said: \u2018Behold, the gold well is as\n      bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that\n      nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening\n      to see if you have obeyed my order.\u2019 The boy placed himself by the brink\n      of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself\n      therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his\n      finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He\n      drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and\n      whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no\n      purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said:\n      \u2018What has happened to the well?\u2019 \u2018Nothing nothing,\u2019 he answered, and held\n      his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said:\n      \u2018You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but\n      take care you do not again let anything go in.\u2019 By daybreak the boy was\n      already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and\n      he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the\n      well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans\n      came, and already knew what had happened. \u2018You have let a hair fall into\n      the well,\u2019 said he. \u2018I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if\n      this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no\n      longer remain with me.\u2019\n     \n      On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\n      however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\n      the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still\n      bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight\n      into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water.\n      He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was\n      already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified the\n      poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head,\n      in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew\n      everything, and said: \u2018Take the handkerchief off.\u2019 Then the golden hair\n      streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no\n      use. \u2018You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth\n      into the world, there you will learn what poverty is. But as you have not\n      a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant\n      you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: \u201cIron\n      Hans,\u201d and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than\n      you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.\u2019\n     \n      Then the king\u2019s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\n      paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\n      looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\n      could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\n      would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\n      they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\n      length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\n      and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no\n      one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal\n      table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his\n      little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king\u2019s\n      notice, and he said: \u2018When you come to the royal table you must take your\n      hat off.\u2019 He answered: \u2018Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my\n      head.\u2019 Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and\n      asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he\n      was to send him away at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and\n      exchanged him for the gardener\u2019s boy.\n     \n      And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\n      the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the\n      garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might\n      cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that\n      the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\u2019s daughter, and up she sprang\n      to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: \u2018Boy,\n      bring me a wreath of flowers.\u2019 He put his cap on with all haste, and\n      gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending\n      the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \u2018How can you take\n      the king\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get\n      another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 replied the\n      boy, \u2018the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.\u2019 When he\n      got into the room, the king\u2019s daughter said: \u2018Take your cap off, it is not\n      seemly to keep it on in my presence.\u2019 He again said: \u2018I may not, I have a\n      sore head.\u2019 She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then\n      his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to\n      behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a\n      handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the\n      gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said: \u2018I present them to\n      your children, they can play with them.\u2019 The following day the king\u2019s\n      daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of\n      field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his\n      cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both\n      hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them,\n      and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the\n      third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from\n      him, and he would not have her money.\n     \n      Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\n      together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\n      opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\n      army. Then said the gardener\u2019s boy: \u2018I am grown up, and will go to the\n      wars also, only give me a horse.\u2019 The others laughed, and said: \u2018Seek one\n      for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable\n      for you.\u2019 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the\n      horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib;\n      nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came\n      to the outskirts, he called \u2018Iron Hans\u2019 three times so loudly that it\n      echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and\n      said: \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 \u2018I want a strong steed, for I am going to the\n      wars.\u2019 \u2018That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.\u2019 Then the\n      wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a\n      stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils,\n      and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of\n      warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun.\n      The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the\n      other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the\n      battlefield a great part of the king\u2019s men had already fallen, and little\n      was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither\n      with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat\n      down all who opposed him. They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and\n      never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning\n      to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest,\n      and called forth Iron Hans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 asked the wild man.\n      \u2018Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse\n      again.\u2019 All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his\n      three-legged horse. When the king returned to his palace, his daughter\n      went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. \u2018I am not the one who\n      carried away the victory,\u2019 said he, \u2018but a strange knight who came to my\n      assistance with his soldiers.\u2019 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange\n      knight was, but the king did not know, and said: \u2018He followed the enemy,\n      and I did not see him again.\u2019 She inquired of the gardener where his boy\n      was, but he smiled, and said: \u2018He has just come home on his three-legged\n      horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: \u201cHere comes our\n      hobblety jib back again!\u201d They asked, too: \u201cUnder what hedge have you been\n      lying sleeping all the time?\u201d So he said: \u201cI did the best of all, and it\n      would have gone badly without me.\u201d And then he was still more ridiculed.\u2019\n     \n      The king said to his daughter: \u2018I will proclaim a great feast that shall\n      last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\n      unknown man will show himself.\u2019 When the feast was announced, the youth\n      went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. \u2018What do you desire?\u2019 asked\n      he. \u2018That I may catch the king\u2019s daughter\u2019s golden apple.\u2019 \u2018It is as safe\n      as if you had it already,\u2019 said Iron Hans. \u2018You shall likewise have a suit\n      of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.\u2019\n      When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst\n      the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king\u2019s daughter came\n      forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught\n      it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\n     \n      On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a\n      white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did\n      not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew angry, and\n      said: \u2018That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.\u2019\n      He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away\n      again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly,\n      they were to cut him down and stab him.\n     \n      On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a\n      black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\n      with it, the king\u2019s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\n      him that he wounded the youth\u2019s leg with the point of his sword. The youth\n      nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the\n      helmet fell from the youth\u2019s head, and they could see that he had golden\n      hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\n     \n      The following day the king\u2019s daughter asked the gardener about his boy.\n      \u2018He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival\n      too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my\n      children three golden apples which he has won.\u2019\n     \n      The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his\n      little cap on his head. But the king\u2019s daughter went up to him and took it\n      off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so\n      handsome that all were amazed. \u2018Are you the knight who came every day to\n      the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden\n      apples?\u2019 asked the king. \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018and here the apples are,\u2019\n      and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king. \u2018If you\n      desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when\n      they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your\n      victory over your enemies.\u2019 \u2018If you can perform such deeds as that, you\n      are no gardener\u2019s boy; tell me, who is your father?\u2019 \u2018My father is a\n      mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.\u2019 \u2018I well\n      see,\u2019 said the king, \u2018that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to\n      please you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 answered he, \u2018that indeed you can. Give me your\n      daughter to wife.\u2019 The maiden laughed, and said: \u2018He does not stand much\n      on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no\n      gardener\u2019s boy,\u2019 and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother\n      came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all\n      hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the\n      marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a\n      stately king came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth,\n      embraced him and said: \u2018I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man,\n      but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be your\n      property.\u2019\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so\n      beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the\n      earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end\n      drew near she called the king to her and said, \u2018Promise me that you will\n      never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I\n      am, and who has golden hair like mine.\u2019 Then when the king in his grief\n      promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not\n      to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife.\n      At last, however, his wise men said, \u2018this will not do; the king must\n      marry again, that we may have a queen.\u2019 So messengers were sent far and\n      wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no\n      princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was\n      not one to be found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and\n      had had all their trouble for nothing.\n     \n      Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and\n      had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at\n      her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his\n      courtiers, \u2018May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead\n      wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth,\n      and you say there must be a queen.\u2019 When the courtiers heard this they\n      were shocked, and said, \u2018Heaven forbid that a father should marry his\n      daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\u2019 And his daughter was\n      also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she\n      said to him, \u2018Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be\n      of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon;\n      and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle\n      of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in\n      the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\u2019 And thus she thought he would\n      think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in\n      his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another\n      silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his\n      hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take\n      the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs\n      was made.\n     \n      When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\n      night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden ring,\n      a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three dresses\u2014of\n      the sun, the moon, and the stars\u2014up in a nutshell, and wrapped\n      herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face\n      and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her\n      need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she\n      came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the\n      hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was\n      midday.\n     \n      Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came\n      to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark.\n      \u2018Look sharp!\u2019 said the king to the huntsmen, \u2018and see what sort of game\n      lies there.\u2019 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back\n      again said, \u2018In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as\n      we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but\n      there it lies fast asleep.\u2019 \u2018See,\u2019 said the king, \u2018if you can catch it\n      alive, and we will take it with us.\u2019 So the huntsmen took it up, and the\n      maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, \u2018I am a poor child that\n      has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you.\u2019\n      Then they said, \u2018Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can\n      sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.\u2019 So they put her into the\n      coach, and took her home to the king\u2019s palace. Then they showed her a\n      little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in,\n      and said, \u2018Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.\u2019 And she was sent into\n      the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the\n      poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work.\n     \n      Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \u2018Ah! pretty\n      princess!\u2019 thought she, \u2018what will now become of thee?\u2019 But it happened\n      one day that a feast was to be held in the king\u2019s castle, so she said to\n      the cook, \u2018May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\n      take care and stand behind the door.\u2019 And the cook said, \u2018Yes, you may go,\n      but be back again in half an hour\u2019s time, to rake out the ashes.\u2019 Then she\n      took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin,\n      and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone\n      forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell,\n      and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to\n      the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they\n      thought she could be no less than a king\u2019s daughter. But the king came up\n      to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his\n      heart, \u2018I never saw any one half so beautiful.\u2019\n     \n      When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round\n      for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the\n      castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that\n      she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her\n      face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When\n      she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the\n      cook said, \u2018Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king\u2019s soup; I\n      should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don\u2019t let a\n      hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.\u2019\n     \n      As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\u2019s soup, and\n      toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\n      was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\n      and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\n      the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\n      that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he\n      saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there,\n      he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard\n      the order, and said to Cat-skin, \u2018You must have let a hair fall into the\n      soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\u2019 Then he went before the\n      king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \u2018I did,\u2019 answered the\n      cook. But the king said, \u2018That is not true; it was better done than you\n      could do it.\u2019 Then he answered, \u2018To tell the truth I did not cook it, but\n      Cat-skin did.\u2019 \u2018Then let Cat-skin come up,\u2019 said the king: and when she\n      came he said to her, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018I am a poor child,\u2019 said she, \u2018that\n      has lost both father and mother.\u2019 \u2018How came you in my palace?\u2019 asked he.\n      \u2018I am good for nothing,\u2019 said she, \u2018but to be scullion-girl, and to have\n      boots and shoes thrown at my head.\u2019 \u2018But how did you get the ring that was\n      in the soup?\u2019 asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew\n      anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her\n      business.\n     \n      After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\n      her go up and see it as before. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said he, \u2018but come again in half an\n      hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\u2019 Then she ran to\n      her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was\n      silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a\n      king\u2019s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her\n      again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the dance was at\n      an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did not see where\n      she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and made herself into\n      Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the\n      cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the\n      soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as\n      well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him\n      that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king,\n      but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes\n      thrown at her head.\n     \n      But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time,\n      it happened just the same as before. \u2018You must be a witch, Cat-skin,\u2019 said\n      the cook; \u2018for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases\n      the king better than mine.\u2019 However, he let her go up as before. Then she\n      put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the\n      ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had\n      never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst he was dancing with\n      her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and ordered\n      that the dance should be kept up a long time. When it was at an end, he\n      would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so\n      quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast\n      as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. But this time she\n      kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time\n      to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her\n      haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her\n      fingers white.\n     \n      Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\u2019s soup; and as soon as\n      the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king\n      got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon\n      saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were\n      dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she\n      wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little\n      on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\n     \n      Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\n      beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\n      washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the most\n      beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said, \u2018You are\n      my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.\u2019 And\n      the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of\n      or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\n    ",
        "\n      There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the\n      cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white\n      and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two\n      rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They\n      were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the\n      world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red.\n      Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking\n      flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her\n      mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was\n      nothing to do.\n     \n      The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\n      other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\n      \u2018We will not leave each other,\u2019 Rose-red answered: \u2018Never so long as we\n      live,\u2019 and their mother would add: \u2018What one has she must share with the\n      other.\u2019\n     \n      They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\n      beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\n      hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their\n      side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the\n      boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n     \n      No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\n      night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\n      and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry\n      on their account.\n     \n      Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\n      them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\n      their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and\n      went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had\n      been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen\n      into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And\n      their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over\n      good children.\n     \n      Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\u2019s little cottage so neat that it\n      was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the\n      house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\u2019s bed\n      before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\n      Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle was of\n      brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening,\n      when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \u2018Go, Snow-white, and bolt the\n      door,\u2019 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her\n      spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened\n      as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and\n      behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its\n      wings.\n     \n      One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\n      knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said: \u2018Quick,\n      Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.\u2019\n      Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man,\n      but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within\n      the door.\n     \n      Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\n      and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\u2019s bed. But the bear began to\n      speak and said: \u2018Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\n      half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\u2019\n     \n      \u2018Poor bear,\u2019 said the mother, \u2018lie down by the fire, only take care that\n      you do not burn your coat.\u2019 Then she cried: \u2018Snow-white, Rose-red, come\n      out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\u2019 So they both came out,\n      and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him.\n      The bear said: \u2018Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little\u2019;\n      so they brought the broom and swept the bear\u2019s hide clean; and he\n      stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It\n      was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their\n      clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon\n      his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him,\n      and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part,\n      only when they were too rough he called out: \u2018Leave me alive, children,\n     \n      When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\n      bear: \u2018You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the\n      cold and the bad weather.\u2019 As soon as day dawned the two children let him\n      out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\n     \n      Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down\n      by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as\n      they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened\n      until their black friend had arrived.\n     \n      When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning\n      to Snow-white: \u2018Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole\n      summer.\u2019 \u2018Where are you going, then, dear bear?\u2019 asked Snow-white. \u2018I must\n      go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the\n      winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and\n      cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed\n      the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what\n      once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see\n      daylight again.\u2019\n     \n      Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door\n      for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a\n      piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if\n      she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The\n      bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\n     \n      A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to\n      get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground,\n      and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the\n      grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they\n      saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long.\n      The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little\n      fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what\n      to do.\n     \n      He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \u2018Why do you\n      stand there? Can you not come here and help me?\u2019 \u2018What are you up to,\n      little man?\u2019 asked Rose-red. \u2018You stupid, prying goose!\u2019 answered the\n      dwarf: \u2018I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\n      The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\n      heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\n      just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but\n      the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree\n      closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so\n      now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced\n      things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\u2019\n     \n      The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\n      was caught too fast. \u2018I will run and fetch someone,\u2019 said Rose-red. \u2018You\n      senseless goose!\u2019 snarled the dwarf; \u2018why should you fetch someone? You\n      are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\u2019\n      \u2018Don\u2019t be impatient,\u2019 said Snow-white, \u2018I will help you,\u2019 and she pulled\n      her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n     \n      As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\n      amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\n      up, grumbling to himself: \u2018Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\n      beard. Bad luck to you!\u2019 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went\n      off without even once looking at the children.\n     \n      Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish.\n      As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper\n      jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it\n      and found it was the dwarf. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 said Rose-red; \u2018you\n      surely don\u2019t want to go into the water?\u2019 \u2018I am not such a fool!\u2019 cried the\n      dwarf; \u2018don\u2019t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?\u2019 The\n      little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had\n      tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made\n      a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish\n      kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all\n      the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to\n      follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being\n      dragged into the water.\n     \n      The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\n      beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\n      together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\n      the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he\n      screamed out: \u2018Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\u2019s face?\n      Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off\n      the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you\n      had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\u2019 Then he took out a sack of\n      pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it\n      away and disappeared behind a stone.\n     \n      It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\n      town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\n      across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There they\n      noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round\n      above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not\n      far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw\n      with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf,\n      and was going to carry him off.\n     \n      The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and\n      pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon\n      as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill\n      voice: \u2018Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown\n      coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!\u2019 Then\n      he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under\n      the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his\n      ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town.\n     \n      As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\n      dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and\n      had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun\n      shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all\n      colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at them.\n      \u2018Why do you stand gaping there?\u2019 cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face\n      became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a loud growling was\n      heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The\n      dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear\n      was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: \u2018Dear Mr Bear,\n      spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels\n      lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little\n      fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these\n      two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails;\n      for mercy\u2019s sake eat them!\u2019 The bear took no heed of his words, but gave\n      the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n     \n      The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: \u2018Snow-white and\n      Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\u2019 Then they\n      recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his\n      bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold.\n      \u2018I am a king\u2019s son,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf,\n      who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a\n      savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\n      well-deserved punishment.\n     \n      Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\n      divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\n      together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her\n      children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they\n      stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses,\n      white and red.\n     \n        The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born\n        in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their\n        lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\n        University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and\n        although Wilhelm\u2019s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\n        collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\n        a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\n        for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\n        sources and published in two volumes of \u2018Nursery and Household Tales\u2019 in\n        1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\n        part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\n        first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\n        came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\n        Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\n        fifty stories \u2018with the amusement of some young friends principally in\n        view.\u2019 They have been an essential ingredient of children\u2019s reading ever\n        since.\n      "

        "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice\n\"without pictures or conversations?",
        "\"Curiouser and curiouser!\" cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \"now I'm\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\"\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \"Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm\nsure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be\nkind to them,\" thought Alice, \"or perhaps they won't walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.",
        "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
        "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.",
        "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
        "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \"From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\"\n\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\n\"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n\n\"Please, then,\" said Alice, \"how am I to get in?\"\n\n\"There might be some sense in your knocking,\" the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, \"if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \"But perhaps he can't help it,\"\nshe said to herself; \"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\"\nshe repeated, aloud.\n\n\"I shall sit here,\" the Footman remarked, \"till tomorrow\u2014\"\n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\n\"\u2014or next day, maybe,\" the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first\nquestion, you know.\"\n\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \"It's really\ndreadful,\" she muttered to herself, \"the way all the creatures argue.\nIt's enough to drive one crazy!\"\n\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. \"I shall sit here,\" he said, \"on and off, for\ndays and days.\"\n\n\"But what am _I_ to do?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Anything you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n\"Oh, there's no use in talking to him,\" said Alice desperately: \"he's\nperfectly idiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in.\n\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n\n\"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \"why\nyour cat grins like that?\"\n\n\"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why. Pig!\"\n\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014\n\n\"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't\nknow that cats _could_ grin.\"\n\n\"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of 'em do.\"\n\n\"I don't know of any that do,\" Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\n\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that's a fact.\"\n\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. \"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\" as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.\n\n\"If everybody minded their own business,\" the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, \"the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\"\n\n\"Which would _not_ be an advantage,\" said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \"Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\"\n\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\n\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I\u2014\"\n\n\"Oh, don't bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.\"\n\n\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\n\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\n\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\n\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!\"\n\n\nCHORUS.\n\n\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\n\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room. The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n\"just like a star-fish,\" thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \"If I don't take this child away with me,\"\nthought Alice, \"they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\" She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n\"Don't grunt,\" said Alice; \"that's not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\"\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \"But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\" she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. \"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\"\nsaid Alice, seriously, \"I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!\" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\" when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \"If it had grown up,\" she said to\nherself, \"it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\" And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \"if one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\" when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n\n\"Cheshire Puss,\" she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. \"Come, it's pleased so far,\" thought Alice, and she went on.\n\"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\"\n\n\"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\" said the Cat.\n\n\"I don't much care where\u2014\" said Alice.\n\n\"Then it doesn't matter which way you go,\" said the Cat.\n\n\"\u2014so long as I get _somewhere_,\" Alice added as an explanation.\n\n\"Oh, you're sure to do that,\" said the Cat, \"if you only walk long\nenough.\"\n\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. \"What sort of people live about here?\"\n\n\"In _that_ direction,\" the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \"lives\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat: \"we're all mad here. I'm mad.\nYou're mad.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm mad?\" said Alice.\n\n\"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\"\n\nAlice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \"And how\ndo you know that you're mad?\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" said the Cat, \"a dog's not mad. You grant that?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Well, then,\" the Cat went on, \"you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\nand wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,\nand wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.\"\n\n\"_I_ call it purring, not growling,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\"\n\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited\nyet.\"\n\n\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\n\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\n\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\" said the Cat. \"I'd nearly\nforgotten to ask.\"\n\n\"It turned into a pig,\" Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\n\"I thought it would,\" said the Cat, and vanished again.\n\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \"I've seen hatters before,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\" As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\n\"Did you say pig, or fig?\" said the Cat.\n\n\"I said pig,\" replied Alice; \"and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\n\"Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,\" thought Alice; \"but a\ngrin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\"\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself \"Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!\"\n",
        "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \"Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" thought Alice; \"only, as it's asleep,\nI suppose it doesn't mind.\"\n\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n\"I don't see any wine,\" she remarked.\n\n\"There isn't any,\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\n\n\"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\n\"I didn't know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it's laid for a great\nmany more than three.\"\n\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\nseverity; \"it's very rude.\"\n\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\n\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least\u2014at least I mean what I\nsay\u2014that's the same thing, you know.\"\n\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\nsay that \u2018I see what I eat' is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see'!\"\n\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that \u2018I like what\nI get' is the same thing as \u2018I get what I like'!\"\n\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \"that \u2018I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\nas \u2018I sleep when I breathe'!\"\n\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\n\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\n\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\n\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\n\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\n\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\"\n\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!\"\n\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\n\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\n\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don't quite\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\n\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\n\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\n\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what's the answer?\"\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\n\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\"\n\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting _it_. It's _him_.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Of course you don't!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\"\n\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\"\n\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then\u2014I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\"\n\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\n\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\n\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\nquarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\" (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"\u2014it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n\u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you're at!'\n\n\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I've heard something like it,\" said Alice.\n\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:\u2014\n\n\u2018Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\n                    Twinkle, twinkle\u2014'\"\n\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\" and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\n\"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \u2018He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!'\"\n\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\"\n\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. \"Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\n\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\n\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\n\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn't asleep,\" he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\n\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\n\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\n\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.\"\n\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\"\n\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\n\"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\n\"they'd have been ill.\"\n\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\n\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\ntake more.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it's very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\n\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Who's making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.\"\n\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\n\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw,\nyou know\u2014\"\n\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let's all move one place\non.\"\n\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \"But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\"\n\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\"\n\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"\u2014well in.\"\n\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\nthings\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\"\n\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\n\nAlice was silent.\n\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\n\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't\nthink\u2014\"\n\n\"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter.\n\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.\n\n\"At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!\" said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood. \"It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!\"\n\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. \"That's very curious!\" she thought. \"But\neverything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\" And\nin she went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. \"Now, I'll manage better this time,\" she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_\u2014she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.\n",
        "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, \"Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" said Five, in a sulky tone; \"Seven jogged my\nelbow.\"\n\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \"That's right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!\"\n\n\"_You'd_ better not talk!\" said Five. \"I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\"\n\n\"What for?\" said the one who had spoken first.\n\n\"That's none of _your_ business, Two!\" said Seven.\n\n\"Yes, it _is_ his business!\" said Five, \"and I'll tell him\u2014it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\"\n\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \"Well, of all the unjust\nthings\u2014\" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.\n\n\"Would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why you are\npainting those roses?\"\n\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, \"Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\" At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn't see it?\" So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \"What's your name, child?\"\n\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn't be afraid of them!\"\n\n\"And who are _these?_\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\n\"How should _I_ know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \"It's\nno business of _mine_.\"\n\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \"Off with her head! Off\u2014\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\n\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \"Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!\"\n\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \"Turn\nthem over!\"\n\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen. \"You make me giddy.\" And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \"What _have_ you been doing\nhere?\"\n\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \"we were trying\u2014\"\n\n\"_I_ see!\" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n\"Off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n\n\"You shan't be beheaded!\" said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.\n\n\"Are their heads off?\" shouted the Queen.\n\n\"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\" the soldiers shouted\nin reply.\n\n\"That's right!\" shouted the Queen. \"Can you play croquet?\"\n\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.\n\n\"Yes!\" shouted Alice.\n\n\"Come on, then!\" roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.\n\n\"It's\u2014it's a very fine day!\" said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\n\"Very,\" said Alice: \"\u2014where's the Duchess?\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush!\" said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \"She's under\nsentence of execution.\"\n\n\"What for?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Did you say \u2018What a pity!'?\" the Rabbit asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Alice: \"I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n\u2018What for?'\"\n\n\"She boxed the Queen's ears\u2014\" the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. \"Oh, hush!\" the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. \"The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said\u2014\"\n\n\"Get to your places!\" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with her head!\" about once in a\nminute.\n\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n\"and then,\" thought she, \"what would become of me? They're dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any\none left alive!\"\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself \"It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\"\n\n\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\n\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \"It's no use\nspeaking to it,\" she thought, \"till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.\" In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\n\"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\noneself speak\u2014and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you've no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\narch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\"\n\n\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Alice: \"she's so extremely\u2014\" Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n\"\u2014likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\n\"Who _are_ you talking to?\" said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n\n\"It's a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\" said Alice: \"allow me to\nintroduce it.\"\n\n\"I don't like the look of it at all,\" said the King: \"however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not,\" the Cat remarked.\n\n\"Don't be impertinent,\" said the King, \"and don't look at me like\nthat!\" He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\n\"A cat may look at a king,\" said Alice. \"I've read that in some book,\nbut I don't remember where.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be removed,\" said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \"My dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!\"\n\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. \"Off with his head!\" she said, without even looking round.\n\n\"I'll fetch the executioner myself,\" said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.\n\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \"but it doesn't\nmatter much,\" thought Alice, \"as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.\" So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\n\nThe executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n\nThe King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n\nThe Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in\nless than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \"It belongs to the\nDuchess: you'd better ask _her_ about it.\"\n\n\"She's in prison,\" the Queen said to the executioner: \"fetch her here.\"\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\n\nThe Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\n\n",
        "\n\"You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\"\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's,\nand they walked off together.\n\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n\"When _I'm_ a Duchess,\" she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), \"I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without\u2014Maybe it's always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\" she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \"and vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes\nthem bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be\nso stingy about it, you know\u2014\"\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \"You're thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it hasn't one,\" Alice ventured to remark.\n\n\"Tut, tut, child!\" said the Duchess. \"Everything's got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.\" And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\nshe spoke.\n\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.\n\n\"The game's going on rather better now,\" she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n\n\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess: \"and the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, 'tis love,\n'tis love, that makes the world go round!'\"\n\n\"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!\"\n\n\"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, \"and the moral of\n_that_ is\u2014\u2018Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.'\"\n\n\"How fond she is of finding morals in things!\" Alice thought to\nherself.\n\n\"I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,\"\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \"the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\"\n\n\"He might bite,\" Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.\n\n\"Very true,\" said the Duchess: \"flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.'\"\n\n\"Only mustard isn't a bird,\" Alice remarked.\n\n\"Right, as usual,\" said the Duchess: \"what a clear way you have of\nputting things!\"\n\n\"It's a mineral, I _think_,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; \"there's a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.'\"\n\n\"Oh, I know!\" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, \"it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that\nis\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be'\u2014or if you'd like it put more\nsimply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.'\"\n\n\"I think I should understand that better,\" Alice said very politely,\n\"if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.\"\n\n\"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,\" the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.\n\n\"Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\" said\nAlice.\n\n\"Oh, don't talk about trouble!\" said the Duchess. \"I make you a present\nof everything I've said as yet.\"\n\n\"A cheap sort of present!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they don't give\nbirthday presents like that!\" But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\n\"Thinking again?\" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n\n\"I've a right to think,\" said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\n\"Just about as much right,\" said the Duchess, \"as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m\u2014\"\n\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,' and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.\n\n\"A fine day, your Majesty!\" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n\"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; \"either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\"\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n\"Let's go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay\nwould cost them their lives.\n\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting \"Off with his head!\" or \"Off with\nher head!\" Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.\n\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \"Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Alice. \"I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.\"\n\n\"It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\" said the Queen.\n\n\"I never saw one, or heard of one,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Come on, then,\" said the Queen, \"and he shall tell you his history,\"\n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, \"You are all pardoned.\" \"Come, _that's_ a\ngood thing!\" she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \"Up, lazy\nthing!\" said the Queen, \"and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;\" and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. \"What fun!\" said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\n\n\"What _is_ the fun?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Why, _she_,\" said the Gryphon. \"It's all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\"\n\n\"Everybody says \u2018come on!' here,\" thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: \"I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\"\n\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. \"What is his sorrow?\" she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \"It's all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\"\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\n\n\"This here young lady,\" said the Gryphon, \"she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.\"\n\n\"I'll tell it her,\" said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \"sit\ndown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.\"\n\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself, \"I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin.\"\nBut she waited patiently.\n\n\"Once,\" said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \"I was a real\nTurtle.\"\n\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of \"Hjckrrh!\" from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying, \"Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\" but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.\n\n\"When we were little,\" the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \"we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\"\n\n\"Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?\" Alice asked.\n\n\"We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\" said the Mock Turtle\nangrily: \"really you are very dull!\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,\" added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \"Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all\nday about it!\" and he went on in these words:\n\n\"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it\u2014\"\n\n\"I never said I didn't!\" interrupted Alice.\n\n\"You did,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\n\n\"We had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\"\n\n\"_I've_ been to a day-school, too,\" said Alice; \"you needn't be so\nproud as all that.\"\n\n\"With extras?\" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"we learned French and music.\"\n\n\"And washing?\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" said Alice indignantly.\n\n\"Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,\" said the Mock Turtle in a\ntone of great relief. \"Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n\u2018French, music, _and washing_\u2014extra.'\"\n\n\"You couldn't have wanted it much,\" said Alice; \"living at the bottom\nof the sea.\"\n\n\"I couldn't afford to learn it.\" said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \"I\nonly took the regular course.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" inquired Alice.\n\n\"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\" the Mock Turtle\nreplied; \"and then the different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\"\n\n\"I never heard of \u2018Uglification,'\" Alice ventured to say. \"What is it?\"\n\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \"What! Never heard of\nuglifying!\" it exclaimed. \"You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice doubtfully: \"it means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" the Gryphon went on, \"if you don't know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.\"\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \"What else had you to learn?\"\n\n\"Well, there was Mystery,\" the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers, \"\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling\u2014the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.\"\n\n\"What was _that_ like?\" said Alice.\n\n\"Well, I can't show it you myself,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"I'm too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\"\n\n\"Hadn't time,\" said the Gryphon: \"I went to the Classics master,\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.\"\n\n\"I never went to him,\" the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \"he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\"\n\n\"So he did, so he did,\" said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\n\"And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\" said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.\n\n\"Ten hours the first day,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"nine the next, and so\non.\"\n\n\"What a curious plan!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\n\"That's the reason they're called lessons,\" the Gryphon remarked:\n\"because they lessen from day to day.\"\n\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. \"Then the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"And how did you manage on the twelfth?\" Alice went on eagerly.\n\n\"That's enough about lessons,\" the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone: \"tell her something about the games now.\"\n\n",
        "\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \"Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\"\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014\n\n\"You may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\" (\"I haven't,\" said\nAlice)\u2014\"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\"\n(Alice began to say \"I once tasted\u2014\" but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid \"No, never\") \"\u2014so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Alice. \"What sort of a dance is it?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the Gryphon, \"you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore\u2014\"\n\n\"Two lines!\" cried the Mock Turtle. \"Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way\u2014\"\n\n\"_That_ generally takes some time,\" interrupted the Gryphon.\n\n\"\u2014you advance twice\u2014\"\n\n\"Each with a lobster as a partner!\" cried the Gryphon.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"advance twice, set to partners\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014change lobsters, and retire in same order,\" continued the Gryphon.\n\n\"Then, you know,\" the Mock Turtle went on, \"you throw the\u2014\"\n\n\"The lobsters!\" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n\n\"\u2014as far out to sea as you can\u2014\"\n\n\"Swim after them!\" screamed the Gryphon.\n\n\"Turn a somersault in the sea!\" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.\n\n\"Change lobsters again!\" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n\n\"Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,\" said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n\n\"It must be a very pretty dance,\" said Alice timidly.\n\n\"Would you like to see a little of it?\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"Very much indeed,\" said Alice.\n\n\"Come, let's try the first figure!\" said the Mock Turtle to the\nGryphon. \"We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\"\n\n\"Oh, _you_ sing,\" said the Gryphon. \"I've forgotten the words.\"\n\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:\u2014\n\n\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n\"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\n\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance\u2014\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\n\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n\"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,\" said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: \"and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!\"\n\n\"Oh, as to the whiting,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"they\u2014you've seen them,\nof course?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alice, \"I've often seen them at dinn\u2014\" she checked herself\nhastily.\n\n\"I don't know where Dinn may be,\" said the Mock Turtle, \"but if you've\nseen them so often, of course you know what they're like.\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Alice replied thoughtfully. \"They have their tails in\ntheir mouths\u2014and they're all over crumbs.\"\n\n\"You're wrong about the crumbs,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is\u2014\" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.\u2014\"Tell her about the reason and all that,\" he said to the Gryphon.\n\n\"The reason is,\" said the Gryphon, \"that they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn't get them out again. That's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Alice, \"it's very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.\"\n\n\"I can tell you more than that, if you like,\" said the Gryphon. \"Do you\nknow why it's called a whiting?\"\n\n\"I never thought about it,\" said Alice. \"Why?\"\n\n\"_It does the boots and shoes_,\" the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \"Does the boots and shoes!\" she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n\"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?\" said the Gryphon. \"I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?\"\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. \"They're done with blacking, I believe.\"\n\n\"Boots and shoes under the sea,\" the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n\"are done with a whiting. Now you know.\"\n\n\"And what are they made of?\" Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\n\"Soles and eels, of course,\" the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n\"any shrimp could have told you that.\"\n\n\"If I'd been the whiting,\" said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song, \"I'd have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back,\nplease: we don't want _you_ with us!'\"\n\n\"They were obliged to have him with them,\" the Mock Turtle said: \"no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it really?\" said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"why, if a fish came to _me_,\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?'\"\n\n\"Don't you mean \u2018purpose'?\" said Alice.\n\n\"I mean what I say,\" the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added \"Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures.\"\n\n\"I could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\" said\nAlice a little timidly: \"but it's no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.\"\n\n\"Explain all that,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"No, no! The adventures first,\" said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n\"explanations take such a dreadful time.\"\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \"_You are old, Father William_,\" to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \"That's very curious.\"\n\n\"It's all about as curious as it can be,\" said the Gryphon.\n\n\"It all came different!\" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \"I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.\" He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\n\"Stand up and repeat \u2018'_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'\" said the\nGryphon.\n\n\"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\nthought Alice; \"I might as well be at school at once.\" However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:\u2014\n\n\"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\n\n\"That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\" said\nthe Gryphon.\n\n\"Well, I never heard it before,\" said the Mock Turtle; \"but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.\"\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\n\"I should like to have it explained,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\"She can't explain it,\" said the Gryphon hastily. \"Go on with the next\nverse.\"\n\n\"But about his toes?\" the Mock Turtle persisted. \"How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?\"\n\n\"It's the first position in dancing.\" Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\n\"Go on with the next verse,\" the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \"it\nbegins \u2018_I passed by his garden_.'\"\n\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014\n\n\"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\"\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\n\n\n\"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, \"if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you'd better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.\n\n\"Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\" the Gryphon\nwent on. \"Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\"\n\n\"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\" Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n\"Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u2018_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old\nfellow?\"\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:\u2014\n\n\"Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\nSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\n\"Beautiful Soup!

        "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the\ntrial done,\" Alice thought, \"and hand 'round the refreshments!\"  The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great\nwig. \"That's the jury-box,\" thought Alice; \"and those twelve creatures\n(some were animals and some were birds) I suppose they are the jurors.\" Just then the White Rabbit cried out \"Silence in the court!\" \"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King. On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then\nunrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows: \"Call the first witness,\" said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\nblasts on the trumpet and called out, \"First witness!\" The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread and butter in the other. \"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\" The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm in arm with the Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I think it\nwas,\" he said. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King, \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have\nyou executed on the spot.\" This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from\none foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his\nconfusion, he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread\nand butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation\u2014she was\nbeginning to grow larger again. The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went\ndown on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, Your Majesty,\" he began. \"You're a very poor speaker,\" said the King. \"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court. \"Call the next witness!\" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once. \"Give your evidence,\" said the King. \"Sha'n't,\" said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low voice,\n\"Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.\" \"Well, if I must, I must,\" the King said. \"What are tarts made of?\" \"Pepper, mostly,\" said the cook. For some minutes the whole court was in confusion and by the time they\nhad settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \"Never mind!\" said the King, \"call the next witness.\" Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list. Imagine her\nsurprise when he read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\nname \"Alice!\"",
        "\"Here!\" cried Alice. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over\nthe jury-box, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd\nbelow. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay. \"The trial cannot proceed,\" said the King, \"until all the jurymen are\nback in their proper places\u2014all,\" he repeated with great emphasis,\nlooking hard at Alice. \"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice. \"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice. The King then read from his book: \"Rule forty-two. All persons more\nthan a mile high to leave the court.\" \"I'm not a mile high,\" said Alice. \"Nearly two miles high,\" said the Queen.  \"Well, I sha'n't go, at any rate,\" said Alice. The King turned pale and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your\nverdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. \"There's more evidence to come yet, please Your Majesty,\" said the White\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry. \"This paper has just been picked\nup. It seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\" He\nunfolded the paper as he spoke and added, \"It isn't a letter, after all;\nit's a set of verses.\" \"Please, Your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn't write it and they\ncan't prove that I did; there's no name signed at the end.\" \"You must have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your\nname like an honest man,\" said the King. There was a general clapping of\nhands at this. \"Read them,\" he added, turning to the White Rabbit. There was dead silence in the court whilst the White Rabbit read out the\nverses. \"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\" said the\nKing. \"I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,\" ventured Alice. \"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. Let the jury consider\ntheir verdict.\" \"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the\nsentence first!\"  \"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple. \"I won't!\" said Alice. \"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved. \"Who cares for you?\" said Alice (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time). \"You're nothing but a pack of cards!\" At this, the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon\nher; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister. \"Why, what a long sleep you've\nhad!\" \"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice. And she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange adventures\nof hers that you have just been reading about. Alice got up and ran off,\nthinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had\nbeen. \nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:\u2014\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister's dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle's heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.\n"

        "\nYou don\u2019t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\u2019t no matter. That book was made by Mr.\nMark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched,\nbut mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied\none time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.\nAunt Polly\u2014Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she is\u2014and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told\nabout in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I\nsaid before.",
        "\nWe went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the\nwidow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape our heads.\nWhen we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We\nscrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big nigger, named Jim, was setting\nin the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light\nbehind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening.\nThen he says:",
        "\nWell, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of\nmy clothes; but the widow she didn\u2019t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and\nclay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave a while if I could.\nThen Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.\nShe told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it\nwarn\u2019t so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn\u2019t any good\nto me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I\ncouldn\u2019t make it work. By-and-by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me,\nbut she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn\u2019t make it out no\nway.",
        "\nWell, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I\nhad been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a\nlittle, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is\nthirty-five, and I don\u2019t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was\nto live forever. I don\u2019t take no stock in mathematics, anyway.",
        "\nI had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was. I used to be\nscared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now,\ntoo; but in a minute I see I was mistaken\u2014that is, after the first jolt, as you\nmay say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away\nafter I see I warn\u2019t scared of him worth bothring about.",
        "\nWell, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for\nJudge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for\nme, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed\nme, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of\nthe time. I didn\u2019t want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I\u2019d go now\nto spite pap. That law trial was a slow business\u2014appeared like they warn\u2019t ever\ngoing to get started on it; so every now and then I\u2019d borrow two or three\ndollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time\nhe got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around\ntown; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited\u2014this kind\nof thing was right in his line.\n \nHe got to hanging around the widow\u2019s too much and so she told him at last that\nif he didn\u2019t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well,\nwasn\u2019t he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn\u2019s boss. So he\nwatched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the\nriver about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where\nit was woody and there warn\u2019t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the\ntimber was so thick you couldn\u2019t find it if you didn\u2019t know where it was.\n \nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived\nin that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head\nnights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted,\nand that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down\nto the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky,\nand fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow\nshe found out where I was by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold\nof me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\u2019t long after that till I\nwas used to being where I was, and liked it\u2014all but the cowhide part.\n \nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and\nfishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes\ngot to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\u2019t see how I\u2019d ever got to like it so\nwell at the widow\u2019s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up,\nand go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and\nhave old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn\u2019t want to go back no\nmore. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn\u2019t like it; but now I took\nto it again because pap hadn\u2019t no objections. It was pretty good times up in\nthe woods there, take it all around.\n \nBut by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick\u2019ry, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. I\nwas all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once\nhe locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he\nhad got drownded, and I wasn\u2019t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I\nmade up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out\nof that cabin many a time, but I couldn\u2019t find no way. There warn\u2019t a window to\nit big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn\u2019t get up the chimbly; it was\ntoo narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to\nleave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted\nthe place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it,\nbecause it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found\nsomething at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was\nlaid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and\nwent to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far\nend of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the\nchinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the\nblanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out\u2014big enough\nto let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the\nend of it when I heard pap\u2019s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my\nwork, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.\n \nPap warn\u2019t in a good humor\u2014so he was his natural self. He said he was down\ntown, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win\nhis lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then\nthere was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do\nit. And he said people allowed there\u2019d be another trial to get me away from him\nand give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this\ntime. This shook me up considerable, because I didn\u2019t want to go back to the\nwidow\u2019s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then\nthe old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think\nof, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\u2019t skipped any, and\nafter that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a\nconsiderable parcel of people which he didn\u2019t know the names of, and so called\nthem what\u2019s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his\ncussing.\n \nHe said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and\nif they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven\nmile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they\ncouldn\u2019t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I\nreckoned I wouldn\u2019t stay on hand till he got that chance.\n \nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was\na fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a\nfour-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding,\nbesides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of\nthe skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with\nthe gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I\nwouldn\u2019t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly\nnight times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the\nold man nor the widow couldn\u2019t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out\nand leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so\nfull of it I didn\u2019t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and\nasked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\n \nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was\ncooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and\nwent to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter\nall night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam\u2014he\nwas just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the\ngovment, this time he says:\n \n\u201cCall this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it\u2019s like. Here\u2019s the\nlaw a-standing ready to take a man\u2019s son away from him\u2014a man\u2019s own son, which\nhe has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising.\nYes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work\nand begin to do suthin\u2019 for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes\nfor him. And they call that govment! That ain\u2019t all, nuther. The law\nbacks that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o\u2019 my property.\nHere\u2019s what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and\nup\u2019ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go\nround in clothes that ain\u2019t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man\ncan\u2019t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I\u2019ve a mighty notion to\njust leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told \u2019em so; I told\nold Thatcher so to his face. Lots of \u2019em heard me, and can tell what I said.\nSays I, for two cents I\u2019d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it\nagin. Them\u2019s the very words. I says look at my hat\u2014if you call it a hat\u2014but the\nlid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it\u2019s below my chin, and then it\nain\u2019t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint\no\u2019 stove-pipe. Look at it, says I\u2014such a hat for me to wear\u2014one of the\nwealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\n \n\u201cOh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a\nfree nigger there from Ohio\u2014a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had\nthe whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain\u2019t a\nman in that town that\u2019s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold\nwatch and chain, and a silver-headed cane\u2014the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in\nthe State. And what do you think? They said he was a p\u2019fessor in a college, and\ncould talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain\u2019t the\nwust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me\nout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was \u2019lection day, and I was\njust about to go and vote myself if I warn\u2019t too drunk to get there; but when\nthey told me there was a State in this country where they\u2019d let that nigger\nvote, I drawed out. I says I\u2019ll never vote agin. Them\u2019s the very words I said;\nthey all heard me; and the country may rot for all me\u2014I\u2019ll never vote agin as\nlong as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger\u2014why, he wouldn\u2019t a give\nme the road if I hadn\u2019t shoved him out o\u2019 the way. I says to the people, why\nain\u2019t this nigger put up at auction and sold?\u2014that\u2019s what I want to know. And\nwhat do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn\u2019t be sold till he\u2019d been\nin the State six months, and he hadn\u2019t been there that long yet. There,\nnow\u2014that\u2019s a specimen. They call that a govment that can\u2019t sell a free nigger\ntill he\u2019s been in the State six months. Here\u2019s a govment that calls itself a\ngovment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet\u2019s got\nto set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a\nprowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and\u2014\u201d\n \nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him\nto, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins,\nand the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language\u2014mostly hove at\nthe nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here\nand there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then\non the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let\nout with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But\nit warn\u2019t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his\ntoes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly\nmade a body\u2019s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and\nheld his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done\nprevious. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan\nin his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort\nof piling it on, maybe.\n \nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two\ndrunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be\nblind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself\nout, one or t\u2019other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets\nby-and-by; but luck didn\u2019t run my way. He didn\u2019t go sound asleep, but was\nuneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long\ntime. At last I got so sleepy I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open all I could do, and\nso before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\n \nI don\u2019t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful\nscream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every\nwhich way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and\nthen he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek\u2014but\nI couldn\u2019t see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin,\nhollering \u201cTake him off! take him off! he\u2019s biting me on the neck!\u201d I never see\na man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell\ndown panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every\nwhich way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming\nand saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by-and-by, and laid\nstill a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn\u2019t make a sound. I could\nhear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible\nstill. He was laying over by the corner. By-and-by he raised up part way and\nlistened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:\n \n\u201cTramp\u2014tramp\u2014tramp; that\u2019s the dead; tramp\u2014tramp\u2014tramp; they\u2019re coming after\nme; but I won\u2019t go. Oh, they\u2019re here! don\u2019t touch me\u2014don\u2019t! hands off\u2014they\u2019re\ncold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!\u201d\n \nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone,\nand he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine\ntable, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through\nthe blanket.\n \nBy-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me\nand went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife,\ncalling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn\u2019t\ncome for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed\nsuch a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up.\nOnce when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by\nthe jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of\nthe jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired\nout, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\nminute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep\nand get strong, and then he would see who was who.\n \nSo he dozed off pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-bottom chair and\nclumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. I\nslipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across\nthe turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him\nto stir. And how slow and still the time did drag along.\n",
        "\n\u201cGit up! What you \u2019bout?\u201d\n \nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was\nafter sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking\nsour and sick, too. He says:\n \n\u201cWhat you doin\u2019 with this gun?\u201d\n \nI judged he didn\u2019t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:\n \n\u201cSomebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you roust me out?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I tried to, but I couldn\u2019t; I couldn\u2019t budge you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, all right. Don\u2019t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and\nsee if there\u2019s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I\u2019ll be along in a minute.\u201d\n \nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some\npieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I\nknowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if\nI was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as\nsoon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log\nrafts\u2014sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them\nand sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.\n \nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\u2019other one out for what\nthe rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a\nbeauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I\nshot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out\nfor the canoe. I just expected there\u2019d be somebody laying down in it, because\npeople often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out\nmost to it they\u2019d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn\u2019t so this time. It was\na drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the\nold man will be glad when he sees this\u2014she\u2019s worth ten dollars. But when I got\nto shore pap wasn\u2019t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek\nlike a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I\njudged I\u2019d hide her good, and then, \u2019stead of taking to the woods when I run\noff, I\u2019d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and\nnot have such a rough time tramping on foot.\n \nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all\nthe time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of\nwillows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on\na bird with his gun. So he hadn\u2019t seen anything.\n \nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \u201ctrot\u201d line. He abused me a\nlittle for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what\nmade me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking\nquestions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.\n \nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out,\nI got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow\nfrom trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck\nto get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might\nhappen. Well, I didn\u2019t see no way for a while, but by-and-by pap raised up a\nminute to drink another barrel of water, and he says:\n \n\u201cAnother time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear?\nThat man warn\u2019t here for no good. I\u2019d a shot him. Next time you roust me out,\nyou hear?\u201d\n \nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying give\nme the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u2019t\nthink of following me.\n \nAbout twelve o\u2019clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was\ncoming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By-and-by\nalong comes part of a log raft\u2014nine logs fast together. We went out with the\nskiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited\nand seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn\u2019t pap\u2019s\nstyle. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and\nsell. So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft\nabout half-past three. I judged he wouldn\u2019t come back that night. I waited till\nI reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on\nthat log again. Before he was t\u2019other side of the river I was out of the hole;\nhim and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n \nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved\nthe vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side\nof bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and\nall the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a\ndipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the\ncoffee-pot. I took fish-lines and matches and other things\u2014everything that was\nworth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u2019t any,\nonly the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I\nfetched out the gun, and now I was done.\n \nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so\nmany things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering\ndust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I\nfixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one\nagainst it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u2019t quite\ntouch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u2019t know it was sawed,\nyou wouldn\u2019t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and\nit warn\u2019t likely anybody would go fooling around there.\n \nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\u2019t left a track. I followed\naround to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So\nI took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for\nsome birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after\nthey had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into\ncamp.\n \nI took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable\na-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and\nhacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed;\nI say ground because it was ground\u2014hard packed, and no boards. Well,\nnext I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it\u2014all I could drag\u2014and I\nstarted it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down\nto the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy\nsee that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was\nthere; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw\nin the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a\nthing as that.\n \nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it\non the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and\nheld him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u2019t drip) till I got a good\npiece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of\nsomething else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the\ncanoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand,\nand ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn\u2019t no knives\nand forks on the place\u2014pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the\ncooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and\nthrough the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile\nwide and full of rushes\u2014and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was\na slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I\ndon\u2019t know where, but it didn\u2019t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a\nlittle track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap\u2019s whetstone there too, so\nas to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the\nmeal sack with a string, so it wouldn\u2019t leak no more, and took it and my saw to\nthe canoe again.\n \nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows\nthat hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a\nwillow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to\nsmoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\u2019ll follow the track of\nthat sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\u2019ll\nfollow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads\nout of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\u2019t\never hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\u2019ll soon get tired of\nthat, and won\u2019t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want\nto. Jackson\u2019s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and\nnobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink\naround and pick up things I want. Jackson\u2019s Island\u2019s the place.\n \nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I\ndidn\u2019t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little\nscared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon\nwas so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along,\nblack and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet,\nand it looked late, and smelt late. You know what I mean\u2014I don\u2019t know\nthe words to put it in.\n \nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I\nheard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It\nwas that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks\nwhen it\u2019s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it\nwas\u2014a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u2019t tell how many was in it. It kept\na-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn\u2019t but one man in it.\nThink\u2019s I, maybe it\u2019s pap, though I warn\u2019t expecting him. He dropped below me\nwith the current, and by-and-by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\nand he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it\nwas pap, sure enough\u2014and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.\n \nI didn\u2019t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but\nquick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out\na quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty\nsoon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me.\nI got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe\nand let her float.\n \nI laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into\nthe sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on\nyour back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can\nhear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I\nheard what they said, too\u2014every word of it. One man said it was getting towards\nthe long days and the short nights now. T\u2019other one said this warn\u2019t one\nof the short ones, he reckoned\u2014and then they laughed, and he said it over\nagain, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him,\nand laughed, but he didn\u2019t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let\nhim alone. The first fellow said he \u2019lowed to tell it to his old woman\u2014she\nwould think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\u2019t nothing to some things\nhe had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o\u2019clock, and\nhe hoped daylight wouldn\u2019t wait more than about a week longer. After that the\ntalk got further and further away, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words any more;\nbut I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a\nlong ways off.\n \nI was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u2019s Island,\nabout two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of\nthe middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any\nlights. There warn\u2019t any signs of the bar at the head\u2014it was all under water\nnow.\n \nIt didn\u2019t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate,\nthe current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the\nside towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank\nthat I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I\nmade fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.\n \nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on\nthe big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile\naway, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big\nlumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in\nthe middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast\nof where I stood I heard a man say, \u201cStern oars, there! heave her head to\nstabboard!\u201d I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.\n \nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and laid\ndown for a nap before breakfast.\n",
        "\nThe sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o\u2019clock. I\nlaid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling\nrested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or\ntwo holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst\nthem. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down\nthrough the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing\nthere was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and\njabbered at me very friendly.\n \nI was powerful lazy and comfortable\u2014didn\u2019t want to get up and cook breakfast.\nWell, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of \u201cboom!\u201d away\nup the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I\nhears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves,\nand I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up\u2014about abreast the\nferry. And there was the ferry-boat full of people floating along down. I knowed\nwhat was the matter now. \u201cBoom!\u201d I see the white smoke squirt out of the\nferry-boat\u2019s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to\nmake my carcass come to the top.\n \nI was pretty hungry, but it warn\u2019t going to do for me to start a fire, because\nthey might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and\nlistened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks\npretty on a summer morning\u2014so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt\nfor my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think\nhow they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because\nthey always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I\u2019ll\nkeep a lookout, and if any of them\u2019s floating around after me I\u2019ll give them a\nshow. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\nhave, and I warn\u2019t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got\nit with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of\ncourse I was where the current set in the closest to the shore\u2014I knowed enough\nfor that. But by-and-by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took\nout the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.\nIt was \u201cbaker\u2019s bread\u201d\u2014what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n \nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the\nbread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something\nstruck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that\nthis bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain\u2019t no\ndoubt but there is something in that thing\u2014that is, there\u2019s something in it\nwhen a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\u2019t work for me, and I\nreckon it don\u2019t work for only just the right kind.\n \nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferry-boat was\nfloating with the current, and I allowed I\u2019d have a chance to see who was\naboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread\ndid. When she\u2019d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and\nwent to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in\na little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through.\n \nBy-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a run out\na plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge\nThatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt\nPolly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking about the\nmurder, but the captain broke in and says:\n \n\u201cLook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\u2019s washed\nashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\u2019s edge. I hope so,\nanyway.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my\nface, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them\nfirst-rate, but they couldn\u2019t see me. Then the captain sung out:\n \n\u201cStand away!\u201d and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made\nme deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was\ngone. If they\u2019d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\u2019d a got the corpse they\nwas after. Well, I see I warn\u2019t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on\nand went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the\nbooming now and then, further and further off, and by-and-by, after an hour, I\ndidn\u2019t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got\nto the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn\u2019t yet a while. They turned\naround the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\nunder steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over to that\nside and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit\nshooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.\n \nI knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got\nmy traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a\nkind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\u2019t\nget at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards\nsundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch\nsome fish for breakfast.\n \nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\nsatisfied; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the\nbank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and\ndrift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain\u2019t no\nbetter way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\u2019t stay so, you soon\nget over it.\n \nAnd so for three days and nights. No difference\u2014just the same thing. But the\nnext day I went exploring around down through the island. I was boss of it; it\nall belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I\nwanted to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and\ngreen summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just\nbeginning to show. They would all come handy by-and-by, I judged.\n \nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\u2019t far from\nthe foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn\u2019t shot nothing; it was\nfor protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I\nmighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the\ngrass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along,\nand all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was\nstill smoking.\n \nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but\nuncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could.\nEvery now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened,\nbut my breath come so hard I couldn\u2019t hear nothing else. I slunk along another\npiece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I\ntook it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a\nperson had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short\nhalf, too.\n \nWhen I got to camp I warn\u2019t feeling very brash, there warn\u2019t much sand in my\ncraw; but I says, this ain\u2019t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my\ntraps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the\nfire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\u2019s camp, and\nthen clumb a tree.\n \nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\u2019t see nothing, I didn\u2019t\nhear nothing\u2014I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand\nthings. Well, I couldn\u2019t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I\nkept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat\nwas berries and what was left over from breakfast.\n \nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I\nslid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank\u2014about\na quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had\nabout made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a\nplunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and\nnext I hear people\u2019s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I\ncould, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I\nhadn\u2019t got far when I hear a man say:\n \n\u201cWe better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out.\nLet\u2019s look around.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old\nplace, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n \nI didn\u2019t sleep much. I couldn\u2019t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked\nup I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn\u2019t do me no good.\nBy-and-by I says to myself, I can\u2019t live this way; I\u2019m a-going to find out who\nit is that\u2019s here on the island with me; I\u2019ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt\nbetter right off.\n \nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let\nthe canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and\noutside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on\nto an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I\nwas most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to\nblow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a\nturn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped\nout and into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out\nthrough the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to\nblanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\nand knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I\nhad run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I\nhadn\u2019t no luck somehow; I couldn\u2019t seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure\nenough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it,\ncautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid\na man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his\nhead, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of\nbushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was\ngetting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\noff the blanket, and it was Miss Watson\u2019s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I\nsays:\n \n\u201cHello, Jim!\u201d and skipped out.\n \nHe bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees, and puts\nhis hands together and says:\n \n\u201cDoan\u2019 hurt me\u2014don\u2019t! I hain\u2019t ever done no harm to a ghos\u2019. I alwuz liked dead\npeople, en done all I could for \u2019em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you\nb\u2019longs, en doan\u2019 do nuffn to Ole Jim, \u2019at \u2019uz awluz yo\u2019 fren\u2019.\u201d\n \nWell, I warn\u2019t long making him understand I warn\u2019t dead. I was ever so glad to\nsee Jim. I warn\u2019t lonesome now. I told him I warn\u2019t afraid of him\ntelling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and\nlooked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s good daylight. Le\u2019s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s de use er makin\u2019 up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But\nyou got a gun, hain\u2019t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.\u201d\n \n\u201cStrawberries and such truck,\u201d I says. \u201cIs that what you live on?\u201d\n \n\u201cI couldn\u2019 git nuffn else,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cWhy, how long you been on the island, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cI come heah de night arter you\u2019s killed.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat, all that time?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014indeedy.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd ain\u2019t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah\u2014nuffn else.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you must be most starved, ain\u2019t you?\u201d\n \n\u201cI reck\u2019n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan\u2019?\u201d\n \n\u201cSince the night I got killed.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! W\u2019y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun.\nDat\u2019s good. Now you kill sumfn en I\u2019ll make up de fire.\u201d\n \nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy\nopen place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and\ncoffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back\nconsiderable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a\ngood big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.\n \nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim\nlaid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had\ngot pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By-and-by Jim says:\n \n\u201cBut looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat \u2019uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn\u2019t\nyou?\u201d\n \nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer\ncouldn\u2019t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:\n \n\u201cHow do you come to be here, Jim, and how\u2019d you get here?\u201d\n \nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn\u2019t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:\n \n\u201cMaybe I better not tell.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, dey\u2019s reasons. But you wouldn\u2019 tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would\nyou, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cBlamed if I would, Jim.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I b\u2019lieve you, Huck. I\u2014I run off.\u201d\n \n\u201cJim!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut mind, you said you wouldn\u2019 tell\u2014you know you said you wouldn\u2019 tell, Huck.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I did. I said I wouldn\u2019t, and I\u2019ll stick to it. Honest injun, I\nwill. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping\nmum\u2014but that don\u2019t make no difference. I ain\u2019t a-going to tell, and I ain\u2019t\na-going back there, anyways. So, now, le\u2019s know all about it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you see, it \u2019uz dis way. Ole missus\u2014dat\u2019s Miss Watson\u2014she pecks on me\nall de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn\u2019 sell me\ndown to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun\u2019 de place\nconsidable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do\u2019\npooty late, en de do\u2019 warn\u2019t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder\nshe gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn\u2019 want to, but she could git\neight hund\u2019d dollars for me, en it \u2019uz sich a big stack o\u2019 money she couldn\u2019\nresis\u2019. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn\u2019 do it, but I never\nwaited to hear de res\u2019. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.\n \n\u201cI tuck out en shin down de hill, en \u2019spec to steal a skift \u2019long de sho\u2019\nsom\u2019ers \u2019bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole\ntumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go \u2019way. Well, I\nwuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun\u2019 all de time. \u2019Long \u2019bout six in de\nmawnin\u2019 skifts begin to go by, en \u2019bout eight er nine every skift dat went\n\u2019long wuz talkin\u2019 \u2019bout how yo\u2019 pap come over to de town en say you\u2019s killed.\nDese las\u2019 skifts wuz full o\u2019 ladies en genlmen a-goin\u2019 over for to see de\nplace. Sometimes dey\u2019d pull up at de sho\u2019 en take a res\u2019 b\u2019fo\u2019 dey started\nacrost, so by de talk I got to know all \u2019bout de killin\u2019. I \u2019uz powerful sorry\nyou\u2019s killed, Huck, but I ain\u2019t no mo\u2019 now.\n \n\u201cI laid dah under de shavin\u2019s all day. I \u2019uz hungry, but I warn\u2019t afeard;\nbekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin\u2019 to start to de camp-meet\u2019n\u2019\nright arter breakfas\u2019 en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle\n\u2019bout daylight, so dey wouldn\u2019 \u2019spec to see me roun\u2019 de place, en so dey\nwouldn\u2019 miss me tell arter dark in de evenin\u2019. De yuther servants wouldn\u2019 miss\nme, kase dey\u2019d shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks \u2019uz out\u2019n de way.\n \n\u201cWell, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went \u2019bout two mile er\nmore to whah dey warn\u2019t no houses. I\u2019d made up my mine \u2019bout what I\u2019s agwyne to\ndo. You see, ef I kep\u2019 on tryin\u2019 to git away afoot, de dogs \u2019ud track me; ef I\nstole a skift to cross over, dey\u2019d miss dat skift, you see, en dey\u2019d know \u2019bout\nwhah I\u2019d lan\u2019 on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff\nis what I\u2019s arter; it doan\u2019 make no track.\n \n\u201cI see a light a-comin\u2019 roun\u2019 de p\u2019int bymeby, so I wade\u2019 in en shove\u2019 a log\nahead o\u2019 me en swum more\u2019n half way acrost de river, en got in \u2019mongst de\ndrift-wood, en kep\u2019 my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de\nraff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en\n\u2019uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De\nmen \u2019uz all \u2019way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz\na-risin\u2019, en dey wuz a good current; so I reck\u2019n\u2019d \u2019at by fo\u2019 in de mawnin\u2019 I\u2019d\nbe twenty-five mile down de river, en den I\u2019d slip in jis b\u2019fo\u2019 daylight en\nswim asho\u2019, en take to de woods on de Illinois side.\n \n\u201cBut I didn\u2019 have no luck. When we \u2019uz mos\u2019 down to de head er de islan\u2019 a man\nbegin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn\u2019t no use fer to wait, so I slid\noverboard en struck out fer de islan\u2019. Well, I had a notion I could lan\u2019 mos\u2019\nanywhers, but I couldn\u2019t\u2014bank too bluff. I \u2019uz mos\u2019 to de foot er de islan\u2019\nb\u2019fo\u2019 I found\u2019 a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn\u2019 fool wid\nraffs no mo\u2019, long as dey move de lantern roun\u2019 so. I had my pipe en a plug er\ndog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn\u2019t wet, so I \u2019uz all right.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd so you ain\u2019t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn\u2019t you\nget mud-turkles?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow you gwyne to git \u2019m? You can\u2019t slip up on um en grab um; en how\u2019s a body\ngwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn\u2019t\ngwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s so. You\u2019ve had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did\nyou hear \u2019em shooting the cannon?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah\u2014watched um thoo de\nbushes.\u201d\n \nSome young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim\nsaid it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young\nchickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds\ndone it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn\u2019t let me. He said it\nwas death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a\nbird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.\n \nAnd Jim said you mustn\u2019t count the things you are going to cook for dinner,\nbecause that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after\nsundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must\nbe told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken\ndown and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn\u2019t sting idiots; but I didn\u2019t\nbelieve that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn\u2019t\nsting me.\n \nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed\nall kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me\nlike all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn\u2019t any\ngood-luck signs. He says:\n \n\u201cMighty few\u2014an\u2019 dey ain\u2019t no use to a body. What you want to know when\ngood luck\u2019s a-comin\u2019 for? Want to keep it off?\u201d And he said: \u201cEf you\u2019s got\nhairy arms en a hairy breas\u2019, it\u2019s a sign dat you\u2019s agwyne to be rich. Well,\ndey\u2019s some use in a sign like dat, \u2019kase it\u2019s so fur ahead. You see, maybe\nyou\u2019s got to be po\u2019 a long time fust, en so you might git discourage\u2019 en kill\nyo\u2019sef \u2019f you didn\u2019 know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s de use to ax dat question? Don\u2019t you see I has?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, are you rich?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had foteen\ndollars, but I tuck to specalat\u2019n\u2019, en got busted out.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did you speculate in, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, fust I tackled stock.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat kind of stock?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, live stock\u2014cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain\u2019 gwyne\nto resk no mo\u2019 money in stock. De cow up \u2019n\u2019 died on my han\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo you lost the ten dollars.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lose it all. I on\u2019y los\u2019 \u2019bout nine of it. I sole de hide en\ntaller for a dollar en ten cents.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b\u2019longs to old Misto Bradish? Well,\nhe sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo\u2019 dollars mo\u2019\nat de en\u2019 er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn\u2019t have much. I\nwuz de on\u2019y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo\u2019 dan fo\u2019 dollars, en I said\n\u2019f I didn\u2019 git it I\u2019d start a bank mysef. Well, o\u2019 course dat nigger want\u2019 to\nkeep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn\u2019t business \u2019nough for two\nbanks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de\nen\u2019 er de year.\n \n\u201cSo I done it. Den I reck\u2019n\u2019d I\u2019d inves\u2019 de thirty-five dollars right off en\nkeep things a-movin\u2019. Dey wuz a nigger name\u2019 Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat,\nen his marster didn\u2019 know it; en I bought it off\u2019n him en told him to take de\nthirty-five dollars when de en\u2019 er de year come; but somebody stole de\nwood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank\u2019s busted. So\ndey didn\u2019 none uv us git no money.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I \u2019uz gwyne to spen\u2019 it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give\nit to a nigger name\u2019 Balum\u2014Balum\u2019s Ass dey call him for short; he\u2019s one er dem\nchuckleheads, you know. But he\u2019s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn\u2019t lucky. De\ndream say let Balum inves\u2019 de ten cents en he\u2019d make a raise for me. Well,\nBalum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat\nwhoever give to de po\u2019 len\u2019 to de Lord, en boun\u2019 to git his money back a hund\u2019d\ntimes. So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po\u2019, en laid low to see what\nwuz gwyne to come of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, what did come of it, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cNuffn never come of it. I couldn\u2019 manage to k\u2019leck dat money no way; en Balum\nhe couldn\u2019. I ain\u2019 gwyne to len\u2019 no mo\u2019 money \u2019dout I see de security. Boun\u2019 to\ngit yo\u2019 money back a hund\u2019d times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten\ncents back, I\u2019d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s all right anyway, Jim, long as you\u2019re going to be rich again some\ntime or other.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; en I\u2019s rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en I\u2019s wuth eight\nhund\u2019d dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn\u2019 want no mo\u2019.\u201d\n",
        "\nI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that\nI\u2019d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the\nisland was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.\n \nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We\nhad a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so\nthick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by-and-by found a good big\ncavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern\nwas as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up\nstraight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there\nright away, but I said we didn\u2019t want to be climbing up and down there all the\ntime.\n \nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the\ncavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they\nwould never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them little birds had\nsaid it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?\n \nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and\nlugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the\ncanoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set\nthem again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n \nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of\nthe door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to\nbuild a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n \nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put\nall the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened\nup, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly\nit begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind\nblow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that\nit looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along\nby so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and\nhere would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\npale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow\nalong and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and\nnext, when it was just about the bluest and blackest\u2014fst! it was as\nbright as glory, and you\u2019d have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about\naway off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see\nbefore; dark as sin again in a second, and now you\u2019d hear the thunder let go\nwith an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky\ntowards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down\nstairs\u2014where it\u2019s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\n \n\u201cJim, this is nice,\u201d I says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be nowhere else but here. Pass\nme along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t a ben here \u2019f it hadn\u2019t a ben for Jim. You\u2019d a ben down dah\nin de woods widout any dinner, en gittn\u2019 mos\u2019 drownded, too; dat you would,\nhoney. Chickens knows when it\u2019s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.\u201d\n \nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it\nwas over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the\nlow places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles\nwide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across\u2014a half a\nmile\u2014because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.\n \nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and\nshady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding\nin and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to\nback away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could\nsee rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed\na day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could\npaddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes\nand turtles\u2014they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was\nfull of them. We could a had pets enough if we\u2019d wanted them.\n \nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft\u2014nice pine planks. It was\ntwelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood\nabove water six or seven inches\u2014a solid, level floor. We could see saw-logs go\nby in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn\u2019t show ourselves in\ndaylight.\n \nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight,\nhere comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a two-story, and\ntilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard\u2014clumb in at an upstairs\nwindow. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in\nher to wait for daylight.\n \nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked\nin at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and\nlots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against\nthe wall. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked\nlike a man. So Jim says:\n \n\u201cHello, you!\u201d\n \nBut it didn\u2019t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n \n\u201cDe man ain\u2019t asleep\u2014he\u2019s dead. You hold still\u2014I\u2019ll go en see.\u201d\n \nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He\u2019s ben shot in de back. I reck\u2019n\nhe\u2019s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan\u2019 look at his face\u2014it\u2019s\ntoo gashly.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn\u2019t\ndone it; I didn\u2019t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards\nscattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks\nmade out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of\nwords and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses,\nand a sun-bonnet, and some women\u2019s underclothes hanging against the wall, and\nsome men\u2019s clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe\u2014it might come good.\nThere was a boy\u2019s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And\nthere was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby\nto suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old\nchest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there\nwarn\u2019t nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered\nabout we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn\u2019t fixed so as to carry\noff most of their stuff.\n \nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a\nbran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles,\nand a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off\nthe bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and\nthread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline\nas thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of\nbuckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine\nthat didn\u2019t have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a\ntolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a\nwooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good\nenough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we\ncouldn\u2019t find the other one, though we hunted all around.\n \nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to shove off\nwe was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I\nmade Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set\nup people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the\nIllinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the\ndead water under the bank, and hadn\u2019t no accidents and didn\u2019t see nobody. We\ngot home all safe.\n",
        "\nAfter breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come\nto be killed, but Jim didn\u2019t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and\nbesides, he said, he might come and ha\u2019nt us; he said a man that warn\u2019t buried\nwas more likely to go a-ha\u2019nting around than one that was planted and\ncomfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say no more; but I\ncouldn\u2019t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and\nwhat they done it for.\n \nWe rummaged the clothes we\u2019d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in\nthe lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that\nhouse stole the coat, because if they\u2019d a knowed the money was there they\nwouldn\u2019t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\u2019t want\nto talk about that. I says:\n \n\u201cNow you think it\u2019s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the\nsnake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said\nit was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands.\nWell, here\u2019s your bad luck! We\u2019ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars\nbesides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever you mind, honey, never you mind. Don\u2019t you git too peart. It\u2019s a-comin\u2019.\nMind I tell you, it\u2019s a-comin\u2019.\u201d\n \nIt did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after dinner\nFriday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got\nout of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in\nthere. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\u2019s blanket, ever so\nnatural, thinking there\u2019d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night\nI forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket\nwhile I struck a light the snake\u2019s mate was there, and bit him.\n \nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint\ncurled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a\nstick, and Jim grabbed pap\u2019s whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.\n \nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of\nmy being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake\nits mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the\nsnake\u2019s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.\nI done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off\nthe rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help.\nThen I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for\nI warn\u2019t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\n \nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and\npitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking\nat the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but\nby-and-by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\u2019d\ndruther been bit with a snake than pap\u2019s whisky.\n \nJim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he\nwas around again. I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin\nagain with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I\nwould believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such\nawful bad luck that maybe we hadn\u2019t got to the end of it yet. He said he\ndruther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times\nthan take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way\nmyself, though I\u2019ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left\nshoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old\nHank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he\ngot drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was\njust a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two\nbarn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\u2019t see it.\nPap told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a\nfool.\n \nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and\nabout the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned\nrabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot\ntwo inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn\u2019t handle him,\nof course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him\nrip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach\nand a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\nand there was a spool in it. Jim said he\u2019d had it there a long time, to coat it\nover so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the\nMississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn\u2019t ever seen a bigger one. He would a\nbeen worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that\nby the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\u2019s\nas white as snow and makes a good fry.\n \nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\nstirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find\nout what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark\nand look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn\u2019t I put on some of\nthem old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we\nshortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my\nknees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair\nfit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to\nlook in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said\nnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around all day\nto get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do pretty well in them,\nonly Jim said I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my\ngown to get at my britches-pocket. I took notice, and done better.\n \nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\n \nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and the\ndrift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and\nstarted along the bank. There was a light burning in a little shanty that\nhadn\u2019t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters\nthere. I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty\nyear old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn\u2019t know\nher face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\u2019t start a face in that town that I\ndidn\u2019t know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid\nI had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had\nbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so\nI knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t forget I was a girl.\n",
        "\n\u201cCome in,\u201d says the woman, and I did. She says: \u201cTake a cheer.\u201d\n \nI done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:\n \n\u201cWhat might your name be?\u201d\n \n\u201cSarah Williams.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere \u2019bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?\u2019\n \n\u201cNo\u2019m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I\u2019ve walked all the way and I\u2019m all\ntired out.\u201d\n \n\u201cHungry, too, I reckon. I\u2019ll find you something.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2019m, I ain\u2019t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a\nfarm; so I ain\u2019t hungry no more. It\u2019s what makes me so late. My mother\u2019s down\nsick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.\nHe lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain\u2019t ever been here\nbefore. Do you know him?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; but I don\u2019t know everybody yet. I haven\u2019t lived here quite two weeks. It\u2019s\na considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all\nnight. Take off your bonnet.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d I says; \u201cI\u2019ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain\u2019t afeared of the\ndark.\u201d\n \nShe said she wouldn\u2019t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in\nby-and-by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she\u2019d send him along with me. Then\nshe got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and\nher relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was,\nand how they didn\u2019t know but they\u2019d made a mistake coming to our town, instead\nof letting well alone\u2014and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made\na mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but\nby-and-by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing\nto let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the\nsix thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard\nlot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was\nmurdered. I says:\n \n\u201cWho done it? We\u2019ve heard considerable about these goings on down in\nHookerville, but we don\u2019t know who \u2019twas that killed Huck Finn.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I reckon there\u2019s a right smart chance of people here that\u2019d like\nto know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014is that so?\u201d\n \n\u201cMost everybody thought it at first. He\u2019ll never know how nigh he come to\ngetting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by\na runaway nigger named Jim.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy he\u2014\u201d\n \nI stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had\nput in at all:\n \n\u201cThe nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there\u2019s a reward\nout for him\u2014three hundred dollars. And there\u2019s a reward out for old Finn,\ntoo\u2014two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder,\nand told about it, and was out with \u2019em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away\nafter he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone,\nyou see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he\nhadn\u2019t ben seen sence ten o\u2019clock the night the murder was done. So then they\nput it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old\nFinn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger\nall over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk,\nand was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking\nstrangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain\u2019t come back sence, and\nthey ain\u2019t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people\nthinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers\ndone it, and then he\u2019d get Huck\u2019s money without having to bother a long time\nwith a lawsuit. People do say he warn\u2019t any too good to do it. Oh, he\u2019s sly, I\nreckon. If he don\u2019t come back for a year he\u2019ll be all right. You can\u2019t prove\nanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he\u2019ll walk\nin Huck\u2019s money as easy as nothing.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I reckon so, \u2019m. I don\u2019t see nothing in the way of it. Has everybody quit\nthinking the nigger done it?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they\u2019ll get the\nnigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, are they after him yet?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you\u2019re innocent, ain\u2019t you! Does three hundred dollars lay around every\nday for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger ain\u2019t far from here. I\u2019m\none of them\u2014but I hain\u2019t talked it around. A few days ago I was talking with an\nold couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say\nhardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson\u2019s\nIsland. Don\u2019t anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn\u2019t say\nany more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I\u2019d seen smoke\nover there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says\nto myself, like as not that nigger\u2019s hiding over there; anyway, says I, it\u2019s\nworth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain\u2019t seen any smoke sence, so I\nreckon maybe he\u2019s gone, if it was him; but husband\u2019s going over to see\u2014him and\nanother man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him\nas soon as he got here two hours ago.\u201d\n \nI had got so uneasy I couldn\u2019t set still. I had to do something with my hands;\nso I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands\nshook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking I\nlooked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. I put\ndown the needle and thread, and let on to be interested\u2014and I was, too\u2014and\nsays:\n \n\u201cThree hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get it. Is\nyour husband going over there to-night?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and\nsee if they could borrow another gun. They\u2019ll go over after midnight.\u201d\n \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes. And couldn\u2019t the nigger see better, too? After midnight he\u2019ll likely be\nasleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire\nall the better for the dark, if he\u2019s got one.\u201d\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d\n \nThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn\u2019t feel a bit\ncomfortable. Pretty soon she says,\n \n\u201cWhat did you say your name was, honey?\u201d\n \n\u201cM\u2014Mary Williams.\u201d\n \nSomehow it didn\u2019t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn\u2019t look\nup\u2014seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was\nafeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would say something\nmore; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But now she says:\n \n\u201cHoney, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes\u2019m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah\u2019s my first name. Some calls me\nSarah, some calls me Mary.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, that\u2019s the way of it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n \nI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I couldn\u2019t\nlook up yet.\n \nWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had\nto live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth\nand so on, and then I got easy again. She was right about the rats. You\u2019d see\none stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she\nhad to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn\u2019t\ngive her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said\nshe was a good shot with it generly, but she\u2019d wrenched her arm a day or two\nago, and didn\u2019t know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a\nchance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n\u201cOuch!\u201d it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted\nto be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn\u2019t let on.\nI got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if\nhe\u2019d a stayed where he was he\u2019d a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was\nfirst-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the\nlump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she\nwanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over\nthem, and went on talking about her and her husband\u2019s matters. But she broke\noff to say:\n \n\u201cKeep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.\u201d\n \nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs\ntogether on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took\noff the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says:\n \n\u201cCome, now, what\u2019s your real name?\u201d\n \n\u201cWh\u2014what, mum?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?\u2014or what is it?\u201d\n \nI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn\u2019t know hardly what to do. But I says:\n \n\u201cPlease to don\u2019t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I\u2019m in the way here,\nI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain\u2019t going to hurt you, and\nI ain\u2019t going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust\nme. I\u2019ll keep it; and, what\u2019s more, I\u2019ll help you. So\u2019ll my old man if you want\nhim to. You see, you\u2019re a runaway \u2019prentice, that\u2019s all. It ain\u2019t anything.\nThere ain\u2019t no harm in it. You\u2019ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind\nto cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn\u2019t tell on you. Tell me all about it now,\nthat\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\n \nSo I said it wouldn\u2019t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just\nmake a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn\u2019t go back on her\npromise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound\nme out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and\nhe treated me so bad I couldn\u2019t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a\ncouple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter\u2019s old\nclothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I\ntraveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I\ncarried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed\nmy uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out\nfor this town of Goshen.\n \n\u201cGoshen, child? This ain\u2019t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen\u2019s ten mile\nfurther up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into\nthe woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take\nthe right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain\u2019t no matter now. I got to be\nmoving along. I\u2019ll fetch Goshen before daylight.\u201d\n \n\u201cHold on a minute. I\u2019ll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.\u201d\n \nSo she put me up a snack, and says:\n \n\u201cSay, when a cow\u2019s laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer up\nprompt now\u2014don\u2019t stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe hind end, mum.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, a horse?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe for\u2019rard end, mum.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich side of a tree does the moss grow on?\u201d\n \n\u201cNorth side.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their\nheads pointed the same direction?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe whole fifteen, mum.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I reckon you have lived in the country. I thought maybe you was\ntrying to hocus me again. What\u2019s your real name, now?\u201d\n \n\u201cGeorge Peters, mum.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, try to remember it, George. Don\u2019t forget and tell me it\u2019s Elexander\nbefore you go, and then get out by saying it\u2019s George Elexander when I catch\nyou. And don\u2019t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor,\nbut you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a\nneedle don\u2019t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the\nneedle still and poke the thread at it; that\u2019s the way a woman most always\ndoes, but a man always does t\u2019other way. And when you throw at a rat or\nanything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\nawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\nstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on,\nlike a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like\na boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws\nher knees apart; she don\u2019t clap them together, the way you did when you catched\nthe lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the\nneedle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along\nto your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into\ntrouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I\u2019ll do what I\ncan to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time you\ntramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road\u2019s a rocky one, and your\nfeet\u2019ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.\u201d\n \nI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and\nslipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in,\nand was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the\nisland, and then started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn\u2019t want\nno blinders on then. When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to\nstrike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but\nclear\u2014eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow,\nthough I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp\nused to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\n \nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below,\nas hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the\nridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused\nhim out and says:\n \n\u201cGit up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain\u2019t a minute to lose. They\u2019re after\nus!\u201d\n \nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for\nthe next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything\nwe had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from\nthe willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the\nfirst thing, and didn\u2019t show a candle outside after that.\n \nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if\nthere was a boat around I couldn\u2019t see it, for stars and shadows ain\u2019t good to\nsee by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the\nfoot of the island dead still\u2014never saying a word.\n",
        "\nIt must a been close on to one o\u2019clock when we got below the island at last,\nand the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was\ngoing to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a\nboat didn\u2019t come, for we hadn\u2019t ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a\nfishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think\nof so many things. It warn\u2019t good judgment to put everything on the\nraft.\n \nIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built,\nand watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us,\nand if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\u2019t no fault of mine. I\nplayed it as low down on them as I could.\n \nWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a tow-head in a big\nbend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet,\nand covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in\nin the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick\nas harrow-teeth.\n \nWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side,\nand the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\u2019t afraid\nof anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and\nsteamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big\nriver in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that\nwoman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us\nherself she wouldn\u2019t set down and watch a camp fire\u2014no, sir, she\u2019d fetch\na dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn\u2019t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?\nJim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and\nhe believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\ntime, or else we wouldn\u2019t be here on a tow-head sixteen or seventeen mile below\nthe village\u2014no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I\ndidn\u2019t care what was the reason they didn\u2019t get us as long as they didn\u2019t.\n \nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood\nthicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up\nsome of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in\nblazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the\nwigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the\nblankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the\nmiddle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with\na frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in\nsloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an\nextra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or\nsomething. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because\nwe must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming\ndown-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\u2019t have to light it\nfor up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a \u201ccrossing\u201d; for\nthe river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water;\nso up-bound boats didn\u2019t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\n \nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was\nmaking over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim\nnow and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the\nbig, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn\u2019t\never feel like talking loud, and it warn\u2019t often that we laughed\u2014only a little\nkind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and\nnothing ever happened to us at all\u2014that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n \nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing\nbut just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we\npassed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg\nthey used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I\nnever believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o\u2019clock\nthat still night. There warn\u2019t a sound there; everybody was asleep.\n \nEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\u2019clock at some little\nvillage, and buy ten or fifteen cents\u2019 worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to\neat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\u2019t roosting comfortable, and\ntook him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because\nif you don\u2019t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good\ndeed ain\u2019t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn\u2019t want the chicken\nhimself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.\n \nMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon,\nor a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap\nalways said it warn\u2019t no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them\nback some time; but the widow said it warn\u2019t anything but a soft name for\nstealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was\npartly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick\nout two or three things from the list and say we wouldn\u2019t borrow them any\nmore\u2014then he reckoned it wouldn\u2019t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked\nit over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our\nminds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or\nwhat. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to\ndrop crabapples and p\u2019simmons. We warn\u2019t feeling just right before that, but it\nwas all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because\ncrabapples ain\u2019t ever good, and the p\u2019simmons wouldn\u2019t be ripe for two or three\nmonths yet.\n \nWe shot a water-fowl, now and then, that got up too early in the morning or\ndidn\u2019t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we lived\npretty high.\n \nThe fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power\nof thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed\nin the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared\nout we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both\nsides. By-and-by says I, \u201cHel-lo, Jim, looky yonder!\u201d It was a steamboat\nthat had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The\nlightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her\nupper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and\nclear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back\nof it, when the flashes come.\n \nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt\njust the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so\nmournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her\nand slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says:\n \n\u201cLe\u2019s land on her, Jim.\u201d\n \nBut Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\n \n\u201cI doan\u2019 want to go fool\u2019n \u2019long er no wrack. We\u2019s doin\u2019 blame\u2019 well, en we\nbetter let blame\u2019 well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey\u2019s a\nwatchman on dat wrack.\u201d\n \n\u201cWatchman your grandmother,\u201d I says; \u201cthere ain\u2019t nothing to watch but the\ntexas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\u2019s going to resk his life\nfor a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it\u2019s likely to break\nup and wash off down the river any minute?\u201d Jim couldn\u2019t say nothing to that,\nso he didn\u2019t try. \u201cAnd besides,\u201d I says, \u201cwe might borrow something worth\nhaving out of the captain\u2019s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you\u2014and cost five\ncents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty\ndollars a month, and they don\u2019t care a cent what a thing costs, you\nknow, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can\u2019t rest, Jim,\ntill we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this\nthing? Not for pie, he wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d call it an adventure\u2014that\u2019s what he\u2019d\ncall it; and he\u2019d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn\u2019t he\nthrow style into it?\u2014wouldn\u2019t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you\u2019d think\nit was Christopher C\u2019lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer\nwas here.\u201d\n \nJim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn\u2019t talk any more than we\ncould help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again\njust in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.\n \nThe deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard,\nin the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and\nspreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn\u2019t\nsee no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and\nclumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain\u2019s door,\nwhich was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a\nlight! and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n \nJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along.\nI says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a\nvoice wail out and say:\n \n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t, boys; I swear I won\u2019t ever tell!\u201d\n \nAnother voice said, pretty loud:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, Jim Turner. You\u2019ve acted this way before. You always want more\u2019n\nyour share of the truck, and you\u2019ve always got it, too, because you\u2019ve swore \u2019t\nif you didn\u2019t you\u2019d tell. But this time you\u2019ve said it jest one time too many.\nYou\u2019re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.\u201d\n \nBy this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and\nI says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\u2019t back out now, and so I won\u2019t either; I\u2019m\na-going to see what\u2019s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the\nlittle passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn\u2019t but one stateroom\nbetwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched\non the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of\nthem had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one\nkept pointing the pistol at the man\u2019s head on the floor, and saying:\n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to! And I orter, too\u2014a mean skunk!\u201d\n \nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \u201cOh, please don\u2019t, Bill; I\nhain\u2019t ever goin\u2019 to tell.\u201d\n \nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:\n \n\u201c\u2019Deed you ain\u2019t! You never said no truer thing \u2019n that, you bet you.\u201d\nAnd once he said: \u201cHear him beg! and yit if we hadn\u2019t got the best of him and\ntied him he\u2019d a killed us both. And what for? Jist for noth\u2019n. Jist\nbecause we stood on our rights\u2014that\u2019s what for. But I lay you ain\u2019t\na-goin\u2019 to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol,\nBill.\u201d\n \nBill says:\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to, Jake Packard. I\u2019m for killin\u2019 him\u2014and didn\u2019t he kill old\nHatfield jist the same way\u2014and don\u2019t he deserve it?\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want him killed, and I\u2019ve got my reasons for it.\u201d\n \n\u201cBless yo\u2019 heart for them words, Jake Packard! I\u2019ll never forgit you long\u2019s I\nlive!\u201d says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\n \nPackard didn\u2019t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and\nstarted towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I\ncrawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I\ncouldn\u2019t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I\ncrawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the\ndark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:\n \n\u201cHere\u2014come in here.\u201d\n \nAnd in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the\nupper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their\nhands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn\u2019t see them, but I could\ntell where they was by the whisky they\u2019d been having. I was glad I didn\u2019t drink\nwhisky; but it wouldn\u2019t made much difference anyway, because most of the time\nthey couldn\u2019t a treed me because I didn\u2019t breathe. I was too scared. And,\nbesides, a body couldn\u2019t breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and\nearnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s said he\u2019ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him\nnow it wouldn\u2019t make no difference after the row and the way we\u2019ve\nserved him. Shore\u2019s you\u2019re born, he\u2019ll turn State\u2019s evidence; now you hear\nme. I\u2019m for putting him out of his troubles.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo\u2019m I,\u201d says Packard, very quiet.\n \n\u201cBlame it, I\u2019d sorter begun to think you wasn\u2019t. Well, then, that\u2019s all right.\nLe\u2019s go and do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cHold on a minute; I hain\u2019t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting\u2019s good,\nbut there\u2019s quieter ways if the thing\u2019s got to be done. But what\nI say is this: it ain\u2019t good sense to go court\u2019n around after a halter\nif you can git at what you\u2019re up to in some way that\u2019s jist as good and at the\nsame time don\u2019t bring you into no resks. Ain\u2019t that so?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou bet it is. But how you goin\u2019 to manage it this time?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, my idea is this: we\u2019ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins\nwe\u2019ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck.\nThen we\u2019ll wait. Now I say it ain\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to be more\u2019n two hours befo\u2019 this\nwrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He\u2019ll be drownded, and\nwon\u2019t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that\u2019s a\nconsiderble sight better \u2019n killin\u2019 of him. I\u2019m unfavorable to killin\u2019 a man as\nlong as you can git aroun\u2019 it; it ain\u2019t good sense, it ain\u2019t good morals. Ain\u2019t\nI right?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I reck\u2019n you are. But s\u2019pose she don\u2019t break up and wash off?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\u2019t we?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, then; come along.\u201d\n \nSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It\nwas dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \u201cJim!\u201d and\nhe answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:\n \n\u201cQuick, Jim, it ain\u2019t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\u2019s a gang of\nmurderers in yonder, and if we don\u2019t hunt up their boat and set her drifting\ndown the river so these fellows can\u2019t get away from the wreck there\u2019s one of\n\u2019em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put all\nof \u2019em in a bad fix\u2014for the Sheriff \u2019ll get \u2019em. Quick\u2014hurry! I\u2019ll hunt the\nlabboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, my lordy, lordy! Raf\u2019? Dey ain\u2019 no raf\u2019 no mo\u2019; she done broke\nloose en gone I\u2014en here we is!\u201d\n",
        "\nWell, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang\nas that! But it warn\u2019t no time to be sentimentering. We\u2019d got to find\nthat boat now\u2014had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking\ndown the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too\u2014seemed a week before we got\nto the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn\u2019t believe he could go any\nfurther\u2014so scared he hadn\u2019t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come\non, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again.\nWe struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\nforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of\nthe skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door,\nthere was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so\nthankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the\ndoor opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from\nme, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\n \n\u201cHeave that blame lantern out o\u2019 sight, Bill!\u201d\n \nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set\ndown. It was Packard. Then Bill he come out and got in. Packard says, in\na low voice:\n \n\u201cAll ready\u2014shove off!\u201d\n \nI couldn\u2019t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:\n \n\u201cHold on\u2014\u2019d you go through him?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. So he\u2019s got his share o\u2019 the cash yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\u201d\n \n\u201cSay, won\u2019t he suspicion what we\u2019re up to?\u201d\n \n\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.\u201d\n \nSo they got out and went in.\n \nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I\nwas in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut\nthe rope, and away we went!\n \nWe didn\u2019t touch an oar, and we didn\u2019t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\nbreathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\npaddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred\nyards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her,\nand we was safe, and knowed it.\n \nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show\nlike a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that\nthe rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they\nwas in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\n \nThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the first\ntime that I begun to worry about the men\u2014I reckon I hadn\u2019t had time to before.\nI begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.\nI says to myself, there ain\u2019t no telling but I might come to be a murderer\nmyself yet, and then how would I like it? So says I to Jim:\n \n\u201cThe first light we see we\u2019ll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a\nplace where it\u2019s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I\u2019ll go\nand fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get\nthem out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.\u201d\n \nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this\ntime worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody\nin bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and\nwatching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds\nstayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by-and-by a flash showed us a\nblack thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.\n \nIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a\nlight now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it. The\nskiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We\nhustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and\nshow a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning\ntill I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down\ntowards it, three or four more showed\u2014up on a hillside. It was a village. I\nclosed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by,\nI see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat. I\nskimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and\nby-and-by I found him roosting on the bitts, forward, with his head down\nbetween his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to\ncry.\n \nHe stirred up, in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me, he\ntook a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\n \n\u201cHello, what\u2019s up? Don\u2019t cry, bub. What\u2019s the trouble?\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cPap, and mam, and sis, and\u2014\u201d\n \nThen I broke down. He says:\n \n\u201cOh, dang it now, don\u2019t take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and\nthis\u2019n \u2019ll come out all right. What\u2019s the matter with \u2019em?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re\u2014are you the watchman of the boat?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. \u201cI\u2019m the captain and the\nowner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and sometimes\nI\u2019m the freight and passengers. I ain\u2019t as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I\ncan\u2019t be so blame\u2019 generous and good to Tom, Dick and Harry as what he is, and\nslam around money the way he does; but I\u2019ve told him a many a time \u2019t I\nwouldn\u2019t trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor\u2019s life\u2019s the life for me,\nand I\u2019m derned if I\u2019d live two mile out o\u2019 town, where there ain\u2019t\nnothing ever goin\u2019 on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of\nit. Says I\u2014\u201d\n \nI broke in and says:\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re in an awful peck of trouble, and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWho is?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you\u2019d take your ferry-boat and\ngo up there\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cUp where? Where are they?\u201d\n \n\u201cOn the wreck.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat wreck?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, there ain\u2019t but one.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t mean the Walter Scott?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood land! what are they doin\u2019 there, for gracious sakes?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t go there a-purpose.\u201d\n \n\u201cI bet they didn\u2019t! Why, great goodness, there ain\u2019t no chance for \u2019em if they\ndon\u2019t git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such\na scrape?\u201d\n \n\u201cEasy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Booth\u2019s Landing\u2014go on.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe was a-visiting there at Booth\u2019s Landing, and just in the edge of the\nevening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all\nnight at her friend\u2019s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her\nname\u2014and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating\ndown, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the\nferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she\nmade a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come\nalong down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn\u2019t notice the wreck\ntill we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but all of us was\nsaved but Bill Whipple\u2014and oh, he was the best cretur!\u2014I most wish\u2019t it\nhad been me, I do.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy George! It\u2019s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And then what did\nyou all do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we hollered and took on, but it\u2019s so wide there we couldn\u2019t make nobody\nhear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the\nonly one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if\nI didn\u2019t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he\u2019d fix the\nthing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since,\ntrying to get people to do something, but they said, \u2018What, in such a night and\nsuch a current? There ain\u2019t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.\u2019 Now if\nyou\u2019ll go and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBy Jackson, I\u2019d like to, and, blame it, I don\u2019t know but I will; but\nwho in the dingnation\u2019s a-going\u2019 to pay for it? Do you reckon your pap\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy that\u2019s all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, particular, that\nher uncle Hornback\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cGreat guns! is he her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light over\nyonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile\nout you\u2019ll come to the tavern; tell \u2019em to dart you out to Jim Hornback\u2019s, and\nhe\u2019ll foot the bill. And don\u2019t you fool around any, because he\u2019ll want to know\nthe news. Tell him I\u2019ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump\nyourself, now; I\u2019m a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\u201d\n \nI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got\ninto my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water\nabout six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I\ncouldn\u2019t rest easy till I could see the ferry-boat start. But take it all\naround, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble\nfor that gang, for not many would a done it. I wished the widow knowed about\nit. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because\nrapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the\nmost interest in.\n \nWell, before long, here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A\nkind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was\nvery deep, and I see in a minute there warn\u2019t much chance for anybody being\nalive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn\u2019t\nany answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang,\nbut not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it, I could.\n \nThen here comes the ferry-boat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a\nlong down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach, I laid on my\noars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss\nHooker\u2019s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would\nwant them; and then pretty soon the ferry-boat give it up and went for the\nshore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.\n \nIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim\u2019s light showed up; and when it did\nshow, it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I got there the sky\nwas beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and\nhid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.\n",
        "\nBy-and-by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of\nthe wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other\nthings, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. We\nhadn\u2019t ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was\nprime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the\nbooks, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened\ninside the wreck and at the ferry-boat, and I said these kinds of things was\nadventures; but he said he didn\u2019t want no more adventures. He said that when I\nwent in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone, he\nnearly died; because he judged it was all up with him, anyway it could be\nfixed; for if he didn\u2019t get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get\nsaved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and\nthen Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most\nalways right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.\n \nI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how\ngaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your\nmajesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, \u2019stead of mister; and\nJim\u2019s eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019 know dey was so many un um. I hain\u2019t hearn \u2019bout none un um, skasely,\nbut ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat\u2019s in a pack er k\u2019yards.\nHow much do a king git?\u201d\n \n\u201cGet?\u201d I says; \u201cwhy, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it; they\ncan have just as much as they want; everything belongs to them.\u201d\n \n\u201cAin\u2019 dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; is dat so?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course it is. They just set around\u2014except, maybe, when there\u2019s a war; then\nthey go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or go hawking\u2014just\nhawking and sp\u2014 Sh!\u2014d\u2019 you hear a noise?\u201d\n \nWe skipped out and looked; but it warn\u2019t nothing but the flutter of a\nsteamboat\u2019s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d says I, \u201cand other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the\nparlyment; and if everybody don\u2019t go just so he whacks their heads off. But\nmostly they hang round the harem.\u201d\n \n\u201cRoun\u2019 de which?\u201d\n \n\u201cHarem.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s de harem?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe place where he keeps his wives. Don\u2019t you know about the harem? Solomon\nhad one; he had about a million wives.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, yes, dat\u2019s so; I\u2014I\u2019d done forgot it. A harem\u2019s a bo\u2019d\u2019n-house, I reck\u2019n.\nMos\u2019 likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck\u2019n de wives quarrels\nconsidable; en dat \u2019crease de racket. Yit dey say Sollermun de wises\u2019 man dat\never live\u2019. I doan\u2019 take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to\nlive in de mids\u2019 er sich a blim-blammin\u2019 all de time? No\u2014\u2019deed he wouldn\u2019t. A\nwise man \u2019ud take en buil\u2019 a biler-factry; en den he could shet down de\nbiler-factry when he want to res\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, but he was the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told me\nso, her own self.\u201d\n \n\u201cI doan k\u2019yer what de widder say, he warn\u2019t no wise man nuther. He had\nsome er de dad-fetchedes\u2019 ways I ever see. Does you know \u2019bout dat chile dat he\n\u2019uz gwyne to chop in two?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, the widow told me all about it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den! Warn\u2019 dat de beatenes\u2019 notion in de worl\u2019? You jes\u2019 take en\nlook at it a minute. Dah\u2019s de stump, dah\u2014dat\u2019s one er de women; heah\u2019s\nyou\u2014dat\u2019s de yuther one; I\u2019s Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill\u2019s de chile.\nBofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun\u2019 mongs\u2019 de neighbors\nen fine out which un you de bill do b\u2019long to, en han\u2019 it over to de\nright one, all safe en soun\u2019, de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would?\nNo; I take en whack de bill in two, en give half un it to you, en de\nyuther half to de yuther woman. Dat\u2019s de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de\nchile. Now I want to ast you: what\u2019s de use er dat half a bill?\u2014can\u2019t buy\nnoth\u2019n wid it. En what use is a half a chile? I wouldn\u2019 give a dern for a\nmillion un um.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut hang it, Jim, you\u2019ve clean missed the point\u2014blame it, you\u2019ve missed it a\nthousand mile.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho? Me? Go \u2019long. Doan\u2019 talk to me \u2019bout yo\u2019 pints. I reck\u2019n I knows\nsense when I sees it; en dey ain\u2019 no sense in sich doin\u2019s as dat. De \u2019spute\nwarn\u2019t \u2019bout a half a chile, de \u2019spute was \u2019bout a whole chile; en de man dat\nthink he kin settle a \u2019spute \u2019bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan\u2019 know\nenough to come in out\u2019n de rain. Doan\u2019 talk to me \u2019bout Sollermun, Huck, I\nknows him by de back.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I tell you you don\u2019t get the point.\u201d\n \n\u201cBlame de point! I reck\u2019n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de real\npint is down furder\u2014it\u2019s down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised.\nYou take a man dat\u2019s got on\u2019y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be\nwaseful o\u2019 chillen? No, he ain\u2019t; he can\u2019t \u2019ford it. He know how to\nvalue \u2019em. But you take a man dat\u2019s got \u2019bout five million chillen runnin\u2019\nroun\u2019 de house, en it\u2019s diffunt. He as soon chop a chile in two as a\ncat. Dey\u2019s plenty mo\u2019. A chile er two, mo\u2019 er less, warn\u2019t no consekens to\nSollermun, dad fatch him!\u201d\n \nI never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there warn\u2019t no\ngetting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see.\nSo I went to talking about other kings, and let Solomon slide. I told about\nLouis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about\nhis little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut\nhim up in jail, and some say he died there.\n \n\u201cPo\u2019 little chap.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut some says he got out and got away, and come to America.\u201d\n \n\u201cDat\u2019s good! But he\u2019ll be pooty lonesome\u2014dey ain\u2019 no kings here, is dey, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cDen he cain\u2019t git no situation. What he gwyne to do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them learns\npeople how to talk French.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Huck, doan\u2019 de French people talk de same way we does?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Jim; you couldn\u2019t understand a word they said\u2014not a single word.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know; but it\u2019s so. I got some of their jabber out of a book.\nS\u2019pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy\u2014what would you\nthink?\u201d\n \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019 think nuff\u2019n; I\u2019d take en bust him over de head\u2014dat is, if he warn\u2019t\nwhite. I wouldn\u2019t \u2019low no nigger to call me dat.\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks, it ain\u2019t calling you anything. It\u2019s only saying, do you know how to\ntalk French?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den, why couldn\u2019t he say it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, he is a-saying it. That\u2019s a Frenchman\u2019s way of saying it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a blame ridicklous way, en I doan\u2019 want to hear no mo\u2019 \u2019bout it.\nDey ain\u2019 no sense in it.\u201d\n \n\u201cLooky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, a cat don\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, does a cow?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, a cow don\u2019t, nuther.\u201d\n \n\u201cDoes a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, dey don\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s natural and right for \u2019em to talk different from each other, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2019Course.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd ain\u2019t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from\nus?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, mos\u2019 sholy it is.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, why ain\u2019t it natural and right for a Frenchman to talk\ndifferent from us? You answer me that.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs a cat a man, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den, dey ain\u2019t no sense in a cat talkin\u2019 like a man. Is a cow a man?\u2014er\nis a cow a cat?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, she ain\u2019t either of them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den, she ain\u2019t got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of\n\u2019em. Is a Frenchman a man?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den! Dad blame it, why doan\u2019 he talk like a man? You\nanswer me dat!\u201d\n \nI see it warn\u2019t no use wasting words\u2014you can\u2019t learn a nigger to argue. So I\nquit.\n",
        "\nWe judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of\nIllinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. We\nwould sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the\nfree States, and then be out of trouble.\n \nWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a tow-head to tie\nto, for it wouldn\u2019t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the\ncanoe, with the line to make fast, there warn\u2019t anything but little saplings to\ntie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank,\nbut there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she\ntore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it\nmade me so sick and scared I couldn\u2019t budge for most a half a minute it seemed\nto me\u2014and then there warn\u2019t no raft in sight; you couldn\u2019t see twenty yards. I\njumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set\nher back a stroke. But she didn\u2019t come. I was in such a hurry I hadn\u2019t untied\nher. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I\ncouldn\u2019t hardly do anything with them.\n \nAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down\nthe tow-head. That was all right as far as it went, but the tow-head warn\u2019t sixty\nyards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid\nwhite fog, and hadn\u2019t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.\n \nThinks I, it won\u2019t do to paddle; first I know I\u2019ll run into the bank or a\ntow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it\u2019s mighty fidgety\nbusiness to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and\nlistened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my\nspirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next\ntime it come, I see I warn\u2019t heading for it, but heading away to the right of\nit. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it\u2014and not gaining on\nit much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t\u2019other, but it\nwas going straight ahead all the time.\n \nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time,\nbut he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was\nmaking the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop\nbehind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else\u2019s whoop, or\nelse I was turned around.\n \nI throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but\nin a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept\nanswering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current\nhad swung the canoe\u2019s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and\nnot some other raftsman hollering. I couldn\u2019t tell nothing about voices in a\nfog, for nothing don\u2019t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\n \nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank\nwith smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the\nleft and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was\ntearing by them so swift.\n \nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly\nstill then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn\u2019t draw a breath\nwhile it thumped a hundred.\n \nI just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island,\nand Jim had gone down t\u2019other side of it. It warn\u2019t no tow-head that you could\nfloat by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be\nfive or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.\n \nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was\nfloating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don\u2019t ever think\nof that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and\nif a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don\u2019t think to yourself how fast\nyou\u2019re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag\u2019s\ntearing along. If you think it ain\u2019t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way\nby yourself in the night, you try it once\u2014you\u2019ll see.\n \nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the\nanswer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn\u2019t do it, and\ndirectly I judged I\u2019d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had little dim\nglimpses of them on both sides of me\u2014sometimes just a narrow channel between,\nand some that I couldn\u2019t see I knowed was there because I\u2019d hear the wash of\nthe current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks.\nWell, I warn\u2019t long loosing the whoops down amongst the tow-heads; and I only\ntried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a\nJack-o\u2019-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so\nquick and so much.\n \nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from\nknocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting\ninto the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear\nout of hearing\u2014it was floating a little faster than what I was.\n \nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn\u2019t hear no\nsign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and\nit was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and\nsaid I wouldn\u2019t bother no more. I didn\u2019t want to go to sleep, of course; but I\nwas so sleepy I couldn\u2019t help it; so I thought I would take jest one little\ncat-nap.\n \nBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was\nshining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern\nfirst. First I didn\u2019t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when\nthings began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.\n \nIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of\ntimber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. I\nlooked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took after it;\nbut when I got to it it warn\u2019t nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast\ntogether. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this\ntime I was right. It was the raft.\n \nWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees,\nasleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The other oar was\nsmashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So\nshe\u2019d had a rough time.\n \nI made fast and laid down under Jim\u2019s nose on the raft, and began to gap, and\nstretch my fists out against Jim, and says:\n \n\u201cHello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn\u2019t you stir me up?\u201d\n \n\u201cGoodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain\u2019 dead\u2014you ain\u2019 drownded\u2014you\u2019s\nback agin? It\u2019s too good for true, honey, it\u2019s too good for true. Lemme look at\nyou chile, lemme feel o\u2019 you. No, you ain\u2019 dead! you\u2019s back agin, \u2019live en\nsoun\u2019, jis de same ole Huck\u2014de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?\u201d\n \n\u201cDrinkin\u2019? Has I ben a-drinkin\u2019? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin\u2019?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what makes you talk so wild?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow does I talk wild?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow? Why, hain\u2019t you been talking about my coming back, and all that\nstuff, as if I\u2019d been gone away?\u201d\n \n\u201cHuck\u2014Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. Hain\u2019t you\nben gone away?\u201d\n \n\u201cGone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain\u2019t been gone\nanywheres. Where would I go to?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, looky here, boss, dey\u2019s sumf\u2019n wrong, dey is. Is I me, or who\nis I? Is I heah, or whah is I? Now dat\u2019s what I wants to know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re here, plain enough, but I think you\u2019re a tangle-headed\nold fool, Jim.\u201d\n \n\u201cI is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn\u2019t you tote out de line in de canoe\nfer to make fas\u2019 to de tow-head?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. What tow-head? I hain\u2019t see no tow-head.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou hain\u2019t seen no tow-head? Looky here, didn\u2019t de line pull loose en de raf\u2019\ngo a-hummin\u2019 down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat fog?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, de fog!\u2014de fog dat\u2019s been aroun\u2019 all night. En didn\u2019t you whoop,\nen didn\u2019t I whoop, tell we got mix\u2019 up in de islands en one un us got los\u2019 en\nt\u2019other one was jis\u2019 as good as los\u2019, \u2019kase he didn\u2019 know whah he wuz? En\ndidn\u2019t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos\u2019 git\ndrownded? Now ain\u2019 dat so, boss\u2014ain\u2019t it so? You answer me dat.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain\u2019t seen no fog, nor no islands, nor\nno troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with you all night till\nyou went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. You\ncouldn\u2019t a got drunk in that time, so of course you\u2019ve been dreaming.\u201d\n \n\u201cDad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn\u2019t any of it happen.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, Huck, it\u2019s all jis\u2019 as plain to me as\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cIt don\u2019t make no difference how plain it is; there ain\u2019t nothing in it. I\nknow, because I\u2019ve been here all the time.\u201d\n \nJim didn\u2019t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it.\nThen he says:\n \n\u201cWell, den, I reck\u2019n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain\u2019t de\npowerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain\u2019t ever had no dream b\u2019fo\u2019 dat\u2019s tired\nme like dis one.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything\nsometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.\u201d\n \nSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it\nhappened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and\n\u201c\u2019terpret\u201d it, because it was sent for a warning. He said the first tow-head\nstood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another\nman that would get us away from him. The whoops was warnings that would come to\nus every now and then, and if we didn\u2019t try hard to make out to understand them\nthey\u2019d just take us into bad luck, \u2019stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of\ntow-heads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all\nkinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn\u2019t talk back and\naggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big\nclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn\u2019t have no more trouble.\n \nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was\nclearing up again now.\n \n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,\u201d I says;\n\u201cbut what does these things stand for?\u201d\n \nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You could see\nthem first-rate now.\n \nJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. He\nhad got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn\u2019t seem to shake it\nloose and get the facts back into its place again right away. But when he did\nget the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling,\nand says:\n \n\u201cWhat do dey stan\u2019 for? I\u2019se gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out wid\nwork, en wid de callin\u2019 for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos\u2019 broke\nbekase you wuz los\u2019, en I didn\u2019 k\u2019yer no\u2019 mo\u2019 what become er me en de raf\u2019. En\nwhen I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en soun\u2019, de tears come, en I\ncould a got down on my knees en kiss yo\u2019 foot, I\u2019s so thankful. En all you wuz\nthinkin\u2019 \u2019bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck\ndah is trash; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey\nfren\u2019s en makes \u2019em ashamed.\u201d\n \nThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying\nanything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost\nkissed his foot to get him to take it back.\n \nIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to\na nigger; but I done it, and I warn\u2019t ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. I\ndidn\u2019t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn\u2019t done that one if I\u2019d a knowed\nit would make him feel that way.\n",
        "\nWe slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\nmonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four\nlong sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men,\nlikely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in\nthe middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about\nher. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.\n \nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot.\nThe river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you\ncouldn\u2019t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and\nwondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn\u2019t,\nbecause I had heard say there warn\u2019t but about a dozen houses there, and if\nthey didn\u2019t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing\na town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show.\nBut I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming\ninto the same old river again. That disturbed Jim\u2014and me too. So the question\nwas, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell\nthem pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at\nthe business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a\ngood idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.\n \nThere warn\u2019t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass\nit without seeing it. He said he\u2019d be mighty sure to see it, because he\u2019d be a\nfree man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he\u2019d be in a slave country\nagain and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:\n \n\u201cDah she is?\u201d\n \nBut it warn\u2019t. It was Jack-o\u2019-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down\nagain, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over\ntrembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me\nall over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it\nthrough my head that he was most free\u2014and who was to blame for it? Why,\nme. I couldn\u2019t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got\nto troubling me so I couldn\u2019t rest; I couldn\u2019t stay still in one place. It\nhadn\u2019t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But\nnow it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to\nmake out to myself that I warn\u2019t to blame, because I didn\u2019t run\nJim off from his rightful owner; but it warn\u2019t no use, conscience up and says,\nevery time, \u201cBut you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a\npaddled ashore and told somebody.\u201d That was so\u2014I couldn\u2019t get around that\nnoway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, \u201cWhat had poor Miss\nWatson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes\nand never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you\ncould treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to\nlearn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.\nThat\u2019s what she done.\u201d\n \nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted\nup and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and\ndown past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around\nand says, \u201cDah\u2019s Cairo!\u201d it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it\nwas Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.\n \nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying\nhow the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to\nsaving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would\nbuy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and\nthen they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn\u2019t\nsell them, they\u2019d get an Ab\u2019litionist to go and steal them.\n \nIt most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn\u2019t ever dared to talk such talk in\nhis life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged\nhe was about free. It was according to the old saying, \u201cGive a nigger an inch\nand he\u2019ll take an ell.\u201d Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here\nwas this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out\nflat-footed and saying he would steal his children\u2014children that belonged to a\nman I didn\u2019t even know; a man that hadn\u2019t ever done me no harm.\n \nI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My conscience\ngot to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, \u201cLet up on\nme\u2014it ain\u2019t too late yet\u2014I\u2019ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.\u201d I\nfelt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone.\nI went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself.\nBy-and-by one showed. Jim sings out:\n \n\u201cWe\u2019s safe, Huck, we\u2019s safe! Jump up and crack yo\u2019 heels! Dat\u2019s de good ole\nCairo at las\u2019, I jis knows it!\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn\u2019t be, you know.\u201d\n \nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to\nset on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\n \n\u201cPooty soon I\u2019ll be a-shout\u2019n\u2019 for joy, en I\u2019ll say, it\u2019s all on accounts o\u2019\nHuck; I\u2019s a free man, en I couldn\u2019t ever ben free ef it hadn\u2019 ben for Huck;\nHuck done it. Jim won\u2019t ever forgit you, Huck; you\u2019s de bes\u2019 fren\u2019 Jim\u2019s ever\nhad; en you\u2019s de only fren\u2019 ole Jim\u2019s got now.\u201d\n \nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it\nseemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I\nwarn\u2019t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn\u2019t.\nWhen I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n \n\u201cDah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on\u2019y white genlman dat ever kep\u2019 his\npromise to ole Jim.\u201d\n \nWell, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it\u2014I can\u2019t get\nout of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns,\nand they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that yonder?\u201d\n \n\u201cA piece of a raft,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cDo you belong on it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAny men on it?\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly one, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, there\u2019s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the\nbend. Is your man white or black?\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn\u2019t come. I tried for\na second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn\u2019t man enough\u2014hadn\u2019t the\nspunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and\nsays:\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s white.\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon we\u2019ll go and see for ourselves.\u201d\n \n\u201cI wish you would,\u201d says I, \u201cbecause it\u2019s pap that\u2019s there, and maybe you\u2019d\nhelp me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He\u2019s sick\u2014and so is mam and\nMary Ann.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, the devil! we\u2019re in a hurry, boy. But I s\u2019pose we\u2019ve got to. Come, buckle\nto your paddle, and let\u2019s get along.\u201d\n \nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke\nor two, I says:\n \n\u201cPap\u2019ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away\nwhen I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can\u2019t do it by myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what\u2019s the matter with your\nfather?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the\u2014a\u2014the\u2014well, it ain\u2019t anything much.\u201d\n \nThey stopped pulling. It warn\u2019t but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One\nsays:\n \n\u201cBoy, that\u2019s a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square\nnow, and it\u2019ll be the better for you.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will, sir, I will, honest\u2014but don\u2019t leave us, please. It\u2019s\nthe\u2014the\u2014gentlemen, if you\u2019ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the\nheadline, you won\u2019t have to come a-near the raft\u2014please do.\u201d\n \n\u201cSet her back, John, set her back!\u201d says one. They backed water. \u201cKeep away,\nboy\u2014keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us.\nYour pap\u2019s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn\u2019t you\ncome out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, a-blubbering, \u201cI\u2019ve told everybody before, and they just went\naway and left us.\u201d\n \n\u201cPoor devil, there\u2019s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but\nwe\u2014well, hang it, we don\u2019t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I\u2019ll tell\nyou what to do. Don\u2019t you try to land by yourself, or you\u2019ll smash everything\nto pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you\u2019ll come to a town\non the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when\nyou ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever.\nDon\u2019t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we\u2019re\ntrying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that\u2019s a\ngood boy. It wouldn\u2019t do any good to land yonder where the light is\u2014it\u2019s only a\nwood-yard. Say, I reckon your father\u2019s poor, and I\u2019m bound to say he\u2019s in\npretty hard luck. Here, I\u2019ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and\nyou get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom!\nit won\u2019t do to fool with small-pox, don\u2019t you see?\u201d\n \n\u201cHold on, Parker,\u201d says the other man, \u201chere\u2019s a twenty to put on the board for\nme. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s so, my boy\u2014good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get\nhelp and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-bye, sir,\u201d says I; \u201cI won\u2019t let no runaway niggers get by me if I can\nhelp it.\u201d\n \nThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed\nvery well I had done wrong, and I see it warn\u2019t no use for me to try to learn\nto do right; a body that don\u2019t get started right when he\u2019s little ain\u2019t\ngot no show\u2014when the pinch comes there ain\u2019t nothing to back him up and keep\nhim to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to\nmyself, hold on; s\u2019pose you\u2019d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt\nbetter than what you do now? No, says I, I\u2019d feel bad\u2014I\u2019d feel just the same\nway I do now. Well, then, says I, what\u2019s the use you learning to do right when\nit\u2019s troublesome to do right and ain\u2019t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is\njust the same? I was stuck. I couldn\u2019t answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t\nbother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at\nthe time.\n \nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn\u2019t there. I looked all around; he warn\u2019t\nanywhere. I says:\n \n\u201cJim!\u201d\n \n\u201cHere I is, Huck. Is dey out o\u2019 sight yit? Don\u2019t talk loud.\u201d\n \nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him\nthey were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:\n \n\u201cI was a-listenin\u2019 to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to\nshove for sho\u2019 if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf\u2019 agin when\ndey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool \u2019em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes\u2019\ndodge! I tell you, chile, I \u2019speck it save\u2019 ole Jim\u2014ole Jim ain\u2019t going to\nforgit you for dat, honey.\u201d\n \nThen we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise\u2014twenty dollars\napiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money\nwould last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile\nmore warn\u2019t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.\n \nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the\nraft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all\nready to quit rafting.\n \nThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a\nleft-hand bend.\n \nI went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the\nriver with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:\n \n\u201cMister, is that town Cairo?\u201d\n \n\u201cCairo? no. You must be a blame\u2019 fool.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat town is it, mister?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin\u2019 around me for\nabout a half a minute longer you\u2019ll get something you won\u2019t want.\u201d\n \nI paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo\nwould be the next place, I reckoned.\n \nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was\nhigh ground, so I didn\u2019t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot\nit. We laid up for the day on a tow-head tolerable close to the left-hand bank.\nI begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says:\n \n\u201cMaybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\u201d\n \nHe says:\n \n\u201cDoan\u2019 le\u2019s talk about it, Huck. Po\u2019 niggers can\u2019t have no luck. I awluz\n\u2019spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn\u2019t done wid its work.\u201d\n \n\u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen that snake-skin, Jim\u2014I do wish I\u2019d never laid eyes on\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t yo\u2019 fault, Huck; you didn\u2019 know. Don\u2019t you blame yo\u2019self \u2019bout it.\u201d\n \nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and\noutside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.\n \nWe talked it all over. It wouldn\u2019t do to take to the shore; we couldn\u2019t take\nthe raft up the stream, of course. There warn\u2019t no way but to wait for dark,\nand start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst\nthe cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back\nto the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\n \nWe didn\u2019t say a word for a good while. There warn\u2019t anything to say. We both\nknowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was\nthe use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and\nthat would be bound to fetch more bad luck\u2014and keep on fetching it, too, till\nwe knowed enough to keep still.\n \nBy-and-by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn\u2019t no way but\njust to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go\nback in. We warn\u2019t going to borrow it when there warn\u2019t anybody around, the way\npap would do, for that might set people after us.\n \nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.\n \nAnybody that don\u2019t believe yet that it\u2019s foolishness to handle a snake-skin,\nafter all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on\nand see what more it done for us.\n \nThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn\u2019t see\nno rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. Well, the\nnight got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You\ncan\u2019t tell the shape of the river, and you can\u2019t see no distance. It got to be\nvery late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the\nlantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn\u2019t generly come close\nto us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs;\nbut nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\n \nWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn\u2019t see her good till she was\nclose. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they\ncan come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the\npilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he\u2019s mighty smart. Well, here\nshe comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn\u2019t seem\nto be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry,\ntoo, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a\nsudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace\ndoors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging\nright over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\nengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam\u2014and as Jim went overboard\non one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.\n \nI dived\u2014and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to\ngo over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under\nwater a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half. Then I\nbounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my\narmpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there\nwas a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten\nseconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now\nshe was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though\nI could hear her.\n \nI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn\u2019t get any answer; so I\ngrabbed a plank that touched me while I was \u201ctreading water,\u201d and struck out\nfor shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the\ncurrent was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing;\nso I changed off and went that way.\n \nIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long\ntime in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn\u2019t\nsee but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter\nof a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house\nbefore I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs\njumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to\nmove another peg.\n",
        "\nIn about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out,\nand says:\n \n\u201cBe done, boys! Who\u2019s there?\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho\u2019s me?\u201d\n \n\u201cGeorge Jackson, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs won\u2019t let\nme.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat are you prowling around here this time of night for\u2014hey?\u201d\n \n\u201cI warn\u2019t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your\nname was?\u201d\n \n\u201cGeorge Jackson, sir. I\u2019m only a boy.\u201d\n \n\u201cLook here, if you\u2019re telling the truth you needn\u2019t be afraid\u2014nobody\u2019ll hurt\nyou. But don\u2019t try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom,\nsome of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, nobody.\u201d\n \nI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man\nsung out:\n \n\u201cSnatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool\u2014ain\u2019t you got any sense? Put it on\nthe floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your\nplaces.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll ready.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir; I never heard of them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that may be so, and it mayn\u2019t. Now, all ready. Step forward, George\nJackson. And mind, don\u2019t you hurry\u2014come mighty slow. If there\u2019s anybody with\nyou, let him keep back\u2014if he shows himself he\u2019ll be shot. Come along now. Come\nslow; push the door open yourself\u2014just enough to squeeze in, d\u2019 you hear?\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t hurry; I couldn\u2019t if I\u2019d a wanted to. I took one slow step at a time\nand there warn\u2019t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were\nas still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the\nthree log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put\nmy hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody\nsaid, \u201cThere, that\u2019s enough\u2014put your head in.\u201d I done it, but I judged they\nwould take it off.\n \nThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at\nthem, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns pointed at me,\nwhich made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other\ntwo thirty or more\u2014all of them fine and handsome\u2014and the sweetest old\ngray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn\u2019t see right\nwell. The old gentleman says:\n \n\u201cThere; I reckon it\u2019s all right. Come in.\u201d\n \nAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and\nbolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went\nin a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a\ncorner that was out of the range of the front windows\u2014there warn\u2019t none on the\nside. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, \u201cWhy,\nhe ain\u2019t a Shepherdson\u2014no, there ain\u2019t any Shepherdson about him.\u201d Then\nthe old man said he hoped I wouldn\u2019t mind being searched for arms, because he\ndidn\u2019t mean no harm by it\u2014it was only to make sure. So he didn\u2019t pry into my\npockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He\ntold me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old\nlady says:\n \n\u201cWhy, bless you, Saul, the poor thing\u2019s as wet as he can be; and don\u2019t you\nreckon it may be he\u2019s hungry?\u201d\n \n\u201cTrue for you, Rachel\u2014I forgot.\u201d\n \nSo the old lady says:\n \n\u201cBetsy\u201d (this was a nigger woman), \u201cyou fly around and get him something to eat\nas quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and\ntell him\u2014oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little stranger and get the\nwet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that\u2019s dry.\u201d\n \nBuck looked about as old as me\u2014thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he\nwas a little bigger than me. He hadn\u2019t on anything but a shirt, and he was very\nfrowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was\ndragging a gun along with the other one. He says:\n \n\u201cAin\u2019t they no Shepherdsons around?\u201d\n \nThey said, no, \u2019twas a false alarm.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cif they\u2019d a ben some, I reckon I\u2019d a got one.\u201d\n \nThey all laughed, and Bob says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you\u2019ve been so slow in coming.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, nobody come after me, and it ain\u2019t right I\u2019m always kept down; I don\u2019t\nget no show.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind, Buck, my boy,\u201d says the old man, \u201cyou\u2019ll have show enough, all in\ngood time, don\u2019t you fret about that. Go \u2019long with you now, and do as your\nmother told you.\u201d\n \nWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and\npants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name\nwas, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a\nyoung rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me\nwhere Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn\u2019t know; I hadn\u2019t heard\nabout it before, no way.\n \n\u201cWell, guess,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cHow\u2019m I going to guess,\u201d says I, \u201cwhen I never heard tell of it before?\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you can guess, can\u2019t you? It\u2019s just as easy.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich candle?\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cWhy, any candle,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he was,\u201d says I; \u201cwhere was he?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, he was in the dark! That\u2019s where he was!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, blame it, it\u2019s a riddle, don\u2019t you see? Say, how long are you going to\nstay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times\u2014they don\u2019t\nhave no school now. Do you own a dog? I\u2019ve got a dog\u2014and he\u2019ll go in the river\nand bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all\nthat kind of foolishness? You bet I don\u2019t, but ma she makes me. Confound these\nole britches! I reckon I\u2019d better put \u2019em on, but I\u2019d ruther not, it\u2019s so warm.\nAre you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.\u201d\n \nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk\u2014that is what they had for\nme down there, and there ain\u2019t nothing better that ever I\u2019ve come across yet.\nBuck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman,\nwhich was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat\nand talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their\nbacks. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the\nfamily was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my\nsister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and\nBill went to hunt them and he warn\u2019t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,\nand then there warn\u2019t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed\ndown to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there\nwas left, because the farm didn\u2019t belong to us, and started up the river, deck\npassage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I\ncould have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and\neverybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the\nmorning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an\nhour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:\n \n\u201cCan you spell, Buck?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cI bet you can\u2019t spell my name,\u201d says I.\n \n\u201cI bet you what you dare I can,\u201d says he.\n \n\u201cAll right,\u201d says I, \u201cgo ahead.\u201d\n \n\u201cG-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n\u2014there now,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d says I, \u201cyou done it, but I didn\u2019t think you could. It ain\u2019t no slouch\nof a name to spell\u2014right off without studying.\u201d\n \nI set it down, private, because somebody might want me to spell it next,\nand so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.\n \nIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn\u2019t seen no\nhouse out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. It\ndidn\u2019t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin\nstring, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn\u2019t no\nbed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds\nin them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the\nbricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with\nanother brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they\ncall Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that\ncould hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece,\nwith a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a\nround place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum\nswinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes\nwhen one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in\ngood shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got\ntuckered out. They wouldn\u2019t took any money for her.\n \nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of\nsomething like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat\nmade of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on\nthem they squeaked, but didn\u2019t open their mouths nor look different nor\ninterested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big\nwild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the\nmiddle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and\noranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and\nyellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn\u2019t real because you could\nsee where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\nwas, underneath.\n \nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue\nspread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the\nway from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly\nexact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of\npictures. One was Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, about a man that left his family, it\ndidn\u2019t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was\ninteresting, but tough. Another was Friendship\u2019s Offering, full of beautiful\nstuff and poetry; but I didn\u2019t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay\u2019s\nSpeeches, and another was Dr. Gunn\u2019s Family Medicine, which told you all about\nwhat to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of\nother books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound,\ntoo\u2014not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n \nThey had pictures hung on the walls\u2014mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and\nbattles, and Highland Marys, and one called \u201cSigning the Declaration.\u201d There\nwas some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead\nmade her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from\nany pictures I ever see before\u2014blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman\nin a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a\ncabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet\nwith a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\nvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\ntombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\nhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and\nunderneath the picture it said \u201cShall I Never See Thee More Alas.\u201d Another one\nwas a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head,\nand knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into\na handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with\nits heels up, and underneath the picture it said \u201cI Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet\nChirrup More Alas.\u201d There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up\nat the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\none hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing\na locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it\nsaid \u201cAnd Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\u201d These was all nice pictures, I\nreckon, but I didn\u2019t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a\nlittle they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because\nshe had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by\nwhat she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition\nshe was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they\nsaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night\nit was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got\nthe chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on\nthe rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back,\nand looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had\ntwo arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two\nmore reaching up towards the moon\u2014and the idea was to see which pair would look\nbest, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\nbefore she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head\nof the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on\nit. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the\npicture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her\nlook too spidery, seemed to me.\n \nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\nobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\nPresbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\nIt was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of\nStephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\n \nODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC\u2019D\n \nAnd did young Stephen sicken,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And did young Stephen die?\nAnd did the sad hearts thicken,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And did the mourners cry?\n\nNo; such was not the fate of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Young Stephen Dowling Bots;\nThough sad hearts round him thickened,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2019Twas not from sickness\u2019 shots.\n\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor measles drear with spots;\nNot these impaired the sacred name\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nDespised love struck not with woe\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That head of curly knots,\nNor stomach troubles laid him low,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\n\nO no. Then list with tearful eye,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whilst I his fate do tell.\nHis soul did from this cold world fly\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By falling down a well.\n\nThey got him out and emptied him;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas it was too late;\nHis spirit was gone for to sport aloft\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the realms of the good and great.\n \nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen,\nthere ain\u2019t no telling what she could a done by-and-by. Buck said she could\nrattle off poetry like nothing. She didn\u2019t ever have to stop to think. He said\nshe would slap down a line, and if she couldn\u2019t find anything to rhyme with it\nwould just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn\u2019t\nparticular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write\nabout just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child\ndied, she would be on hand with her \u201ctribute\u201d before he was cold. She called\nthem tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then\nthe undertaker\u2014the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then\nshe hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person\u2019s name, which was Whistler. She\nwarn\u2019t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined\naway and did not live long. Poor thing, many\u2019s the time I made myself go up to\nthe little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and\nread in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a\nlittle. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn\u2019t going to let\nanything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people\nwhen she was alive, and it didn\u2019t seem right that there warn\u2019t nobody to make\nsome about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself,\nbut I couldn\u2019t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline\u2019s room trim and\nnice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when\nshe was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room\nherself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal\nand read her Bible there mostly.\n \nWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the\nwindows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down\nthe walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little old piano, too,\nthat had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear\nthe young ladies sing \u201cThe Last Link is Broken\u201d and play \u201cThe Battle of Prague\u201d\non it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the\nfloors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.\n \nIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and\nfloored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it\nwas a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn\u2019t be better. And warn\u2019t the\ncooking good, and just bushels of it too!\n",
        "\nCol. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so\nwas his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that\u2019s worth as much in\na man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied\nthat she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it,\ntoo, though he warn\u2019t no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford\nwas very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of\nred in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face,\nand he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a\nhigh nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back\nthat they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.\nHis forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his\nshoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a\nclean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it\nhurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with\nbrass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There\nwarn\u2019t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\u2019t ever loud. He was\nas kind as he could be\u2014you could feel that, you know, and so you had\nconfidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\nstraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker\nout from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out\nwhat the matter was afterwards. He didn\u2019t ever have to tell anybody to mind\ntheir manners\u2014everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved\nto have him around, too; he was sunshine most always\u2014I mean he made it seem\nlike good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a\nminute, and that was enough; there wouldn\u2019t nothing go wrong again for a week.\n \nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of\ntheir chairs and give them good-day, and didn\u2019t set down again till they had\nset down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and\nmixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and\nwaited till Tom\u2019s and Bob\u2019s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \u201cOur duty\nto you, sir, and madam;\u201d and they bowed the least bit in the world and\nsaid thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful\nof water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of\ntheir tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\n \nBob was the oldest and Tom next\u2014tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders\nand brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white\nlinen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.\n \nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and\ngrand, but as good as she could be when she warn\u2019t stirred up; but when she was,\nshe had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She\nwas beautiful.\n \nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and\nsweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\n \nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them\u2014Buck too. My nigger had a\nmonstrous easy time, because I warn\u2019t used to having anybody do anything for\nme, but Buck\u2019s was on the jump most of the time.\n \nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more\u2014three sons;\nthey got killed; and Emmeline that died.\n \nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a\nstack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around,\nand stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the\nriver, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house\nnights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their\nguns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n \nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there\u2014five or six families\u2014mostly\nof the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and well born and rich and\ngrand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the\nsame steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes\nwhen I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the\nShepherdsons there on their fine horses.\n \nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\ncoming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:\n \n\u201cQuick! Jump for the woods!\u201d\n \nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a\nsplendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and\nlooking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him\nbefore. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck\u2019s gun go off at my ear,\nand Harney\u2019s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode\nstraight to the place where we was hid. But we didn\u2019t wait. We started through\nthe woods on a run. The woods warn\u2019t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to\ndodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he\nrode away the way he come\u2014to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\u2019t see. We\nnever stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman\u2019s eyes blazed a\nminute\u2014\u2019twas pleasure, mainly, I judged\u2014then his face sort of smoothed down,\nand he says, kind of gentle:\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn\u2019t you step into the\nroad, my boy?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe Shepherdsons don\u2019t, father. They always take advantage.\u201d\n \nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his\ntale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men looked\ndark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come\nback when she found the man warn\u2019t hurt.\n \nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I\nsays:\n \n\u201cDid you want to kill him, Buck?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I bet I did.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d\n \n\u201cHim? He never done nothing to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what did you want to kill him for?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, nothing\u2014only it\u2019s on account of the feud.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s a feud?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, where was you raised? Don\u2019t you know what a feud is?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever heard of it before\u2014tell me about it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d says Buck, \u201ca feud is this way. A man has a quarrel with another man,\nand kills him; then that other man\u2019s brother kills him; then the other\nbrothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip\nin\u2014and by-and-by everybody\u2019s killed off, and there ain\u2019t no more feud. But it\u2019s\nkind of slow, and takes a long time.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas this one been going on long, Buck?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I should reckon! It started thirty year ago, or som\u2019ers along\nthere. There was trouble \u2019bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and\nthe suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the\nsuit\u2014which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody would.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat was the trouble about, Buck?\u2014land?\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon maybe\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\u201d\n \n\u201cLaws, how do I know? It was so long ago.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t anybody know?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they don\u2019t\nknow now what the row was about in the first place.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas there been many killed, Buck?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don\u2019t always kill. Pa\u2019s got a\nfew buckshot in him; but he don\u2019t mind it \u2019cuz he don\u2019t weigh much, anyway.\nBob\u2019s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\u2019s been hurt once or twice.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas anybody been killed this year, Buck?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; we got one and they got one. \u2019Bout three months ago my cousin Bud,\nfourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t\u2019other side of the river,\nand didn\u2019t have no weapon with him, which was blame\u2019 foolishness, and in a\nlonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy\nShepherdson a-linkin\u2019 after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair\na-flying in the wind; and \u2019stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud\n\u2019lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or\nmore, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn\u2019t any\nuse, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front,\nyou know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn\u2019t git much\nchance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him out.\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon he warn\u2019t a coward. Not by a blame\u2019 sight. There ain\u2019t a\ncoward amongst them Shepherdsons\u2014not a one. And there ain\u2019t no cowards amongst\nthe Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep\u2019 up his end in a fight one day\nfor half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all\na-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep\u2019\nhis horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their\nhorses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he\npeppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and\ncrippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home\u2014and one of \u2019em was\ndead, and another died the next day. No, sir; if a body\u2019s out hunting for\ncowards he don\u2019t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\nthey don\u2019t breed any of that kind.\u201d\n \nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback. The\nmen took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or\nstood them handy against the wall. The Shepherdsons done the same. It was\npretty ornery preaching\u2014all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness;\nbut everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going\nhome, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free\ngrace and preforeordestination, and I don\u2019t know what all, that it did seem to\nme to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\n \nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs\nand some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was\nstretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and\njudged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in\nher door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door\nvery soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I\nwould do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she\nsaid she\u2019d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two\nother books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and\nnot say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\nroad, and there warn\u2019t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for\nthere warn\u2019t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in\nsummer-time because it\u2019s cool. If you notice, most folks don\u2019t go to church\nonly when they\u2019ve got to; but a hog is different.\n \nSays I to myself, something\u2019s up; it ain\u2019t natural for a girl to be in such a\nsweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of\npaper with \u201cHalf-past two\u201d wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it,\nbut couldn\u2019t find anything else. I couldn\u2019t make anything out of that, so I put\nthe paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss\nSophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she\nlooked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it\nshe looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a\nsqueeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She\nwas mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made\nher powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I\nasked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I\nsaid no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her \u201cno, only\ncoarse-hand,\u201d and then she said the paper warn\u2019t anything but a book-mark to\nkeep her place, and I might go and play now.\n \nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I\nnoticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of sight of\nthe house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and\nsays:\n \n\u201cMars Jawge, if you\u2019ll come down into de swamp I\u2019ll show you a whole stack o\u2019\nwater-moccasins.\u201d\n \nThinks I, that\u2019s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter know a body\ndon\u2019t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them. What is he up\nto, anyway? So I says:\n \n\u201cAll right; trot ahead.\u201d\n \nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle\ndeep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece of land which\nwas dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he says:\n \n\u201cYou shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah\u2019s whah dey is. I\u2019s\nseed \u2019m befo\u2019; I don\u2019t k\u2019yer to see \u2019em no mo\u2019.\u201d\n \nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him. I\npoked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom\nall hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep\u2014and, by jings,\nit was my old Jim!\n \nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to\nsee me again, but it warn\u2019t. He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn\u2019t\nsurprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard me yell every\ntime, but dasn\u2019t answer, because he didn\u2019t want nobody to pick him up\nand take him into slavery again. Says he:\n \n\u201cI got hurt a little, en couldn\u2019t swim fas\u2019, so I wuz a considable ways behine\nyou towards de las\u2019; when you landed I reck\u2019ned I could ketch up wid you on de\nlan\u2019 \u2019dout havin\u2019 to shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow.\nI \u2019uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you\u2014I wuz \u2019fraid o\u2019 de dogs; but when\nit \u2019uz all quiet agin, I knowed you\u2019s in de house, so I struck out for de woods\nto wait for day. Early in de mawnin\u2019 some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de\nfields, en dey tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can\u2019t track me on\naccounts o\u2019 de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me\nhow you\u2019s a-gitt\u2019n along.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, \u2019twarn\u2019t no use to \u2019sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn\u2014but we\u2019s all\nright now. I ben a-buyin\u2019 pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en\na-patchin\u2019 up de raf\u2019 nights when\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat raft, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cOur ole raf\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou mean to say our old raft warn\u2019t smashed all to flinders?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, she warn\u2019t. She was tore up a good deal\u2014one en\u2019 of her was; but dey warn\u2019t\nno great harm done, on\u2019y our traps was mos\u2019 all los\u2019. Ef we hadn\u2019 dive\u2019 so deep\nen swum so fur under water, en de night hadn\u2019 ben so dark, en we warn\u2019t so\nsk\u2019yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin\u2019 is, we\u2019d a seed de raf\u2019. But\nit\u2019s jis\u2019 as well we didn\u2019t, \u2019kase now she\u2019s all fixed up agin mos\u2019 as good as\nnew, en we\u2019s got a new lot o\u2019 stuff, in de place o\u2019 what \u2019uz los\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim\u2014did you catch her?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers foun\u2019\nher ketched on a snag along heah in de ben\u2019, en dey hid her in a crick \u2019mongst\nde willows, en dey wuz so much jawin\u2019 \u2019bout which un \u2019um she b\u2019long to de mos\u2019\ndat I come to heah \u2019bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by\ntellin\u2019 \u2019um she don\u2019t b\u2019long to none uv um, but to you en me; en I ast \u2019m if\ndey gwyne to grab a young white genlman\u2019s propaty, en git a hid\u2019n for it? Den I\ngin \u2019m ten cents apiece, en dey \u2019uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo\u2019\nraf\u2019s \u2019ud come along en make \u2019m rich agin. Dey\u2019s mighty good to me, dese\nniggers is, en whatever I wants \u2019m to do fur me, I doan\u2019 have to ast \u2019m twice,\nhoney. Dat Jack\u2019s a good nigger, en pooty smart.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, he is. He ain\u2019t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and he\u2019d show\nme a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens he ain\u2019t mixed up in\nit. He can say he never seen us together, and it\u2019ll be the truth.\u201d\n \nI don\u2019t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I\u2019ll cut it pretty\nshort. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep\nagain, when I noticed how still it was\u2014didn\u2019t seem to be anybody stirring. That\nwarn\u2019t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up,\na-wondering, and goes down stairs\u2014nobody around; everything as still as a\nmouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the\nwood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d\n \nSays he:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you know, Mars Jawge?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d says I, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, den, Miss Sophia\u2019s run off! \u2019deed she has. She run off in de night some\ntime\u2014nobody don\u2019t know jis\u2019 when; run off to get married to dat young Harney\nShepherdson, you know\u2014leastways, so dey \u2019spec. De fambly foun\u2019 it out \u2019bout\nhalf an hour ago\u2014maybe a little mo\u2019\u2014en\u2019 I tell you dey warn\u2019t no time\nlos\u2019. Sich another hurryin\u2019 up guns en hosses you never see! De women\nfolks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck\ndey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him\n\u2019fo\u2019 he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck\u2019n dey\u2019s gwyne to be\nmighty rough times.\u201d\n \n\u201cBuck went off \u2019thout waking me up.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I reck\u2019n he did! Dey warn\u2019t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck\nhe loaded up his gun en \u2019lowed he\u2019s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust.\nWell, dey\u2019ll be plenty un \u2019m dah, I reck\u2019n, en you bet you he\u2019ll fetch one ef\nhe gits a chanst.\u201d\n \nI took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to hear guns\na good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where\nthe steamboats lands, I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a\ngood place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of\nreach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front\nof the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was\nluckier I didn\u2019t.\n \nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place\nbefore the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of\nyoung chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing;\nbut they couldn\u2019t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river\nside of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back\nbehind the pile, so they could watch both ways.\n \nBy-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding\ntowards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the\nwood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of\ntheir horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store;\nand that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half way to the tree\nI was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their\nhorses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn\u2019t do no\ngood, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front\nof my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men\nagain. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about\nnineteen years old.\n \nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of\nsight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn\u2019t know what to make of my voice\ncoming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch\nout sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up\nto some devilment or other\u2014wouldn\u2019t be gone long. I wished I was out of that\ntree, but I dasn\u2019t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and \u2019lowed that him\nand his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day\nyet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of\nthe enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father\nand brothers ought to waited for their relations\u2014the Shepherdsons was too\nstrong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.\nHe said they\u2019d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the\nway Buck did take on because he didn\u2019t manage to kill Harney that day he shot\nat him\u2014I hain\u2019t ever heard anything like it.\n \nAll of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns\u2014the men had slipped\naround through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys\njumped for the river\u2014both of them hurt\u2014and as they swum down the current the\nmen run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, \u201cKill them, kill\nthem!\u201d It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain\u2019t a-going to tell\nall that happened\u2014it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I\nwished I hadn\u2019t ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain\u2019t ever\ngoing to get shut of them\u2014lots of times I dream about them.\n \nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes\nI heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop\npast the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I\nwas mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn\u2019t ever go anear that\nhouse again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that\npiece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at\nhalf-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that\npaper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up,\nand this awful mess wouldn\u2019t ever happened.\n \nWhen I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a piece, and\nfound the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I\ngot them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I\ncould. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck\u2019s face, for he was mighty\ngood to me.\n \nIt was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods\nand made for the swamp. Jim warn\u2019t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry\nfor the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get\nout of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I\ncouldn\u2019t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not\ntwenty-five foot from me says:\n \n\u201cGood lan\u2019! is dat you, honey? Doan\u2019 make no noise.\u201d\n \nIt was Jim\u2019s voice\u2014nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a\npiece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to\nsee me. He says:\n \n\u201cLaws bless you, chile, I \u2019uz right down sho\u2019 you\u2019s dead agin. Jack\u2019s been\nheah; he say he reck\u2019n you\u2019s ben shot, kase you didn\u2019 come home no mo\u2019; so I\u2019s\njes\u2019 dis minute a startin\u2019 de raf\u2019 down towards de mouf er de crick, so\u2019s to be\nall ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for\ncertain you is dead. Lawsy, I\u2019s mighty glad to git you back agin,\nhoney.\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cAll right\u2014that\u2019s mighty good; they won\u2019t find me, and they\u2019ll think I\u2019ve been\nkilled, and floated down the river\u2014there\u2019s something up there that\u2019ll help\nthem think so\u2014so don\u2019t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big\nwater as fast as ever you can.\u201d\n \nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle\nof the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was\nfree and safe once more. I hadn\u2019t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he\ngot out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens\u2014there\nain\u2019t nothing in the world so good when it\u2019s cooked right\u2014and whilst I eat my\nsupper we talked, and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the\nfeuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn\u2019t no home\nlike a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a\nraft don\u2019t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\n",
        "\nTwo or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they\nslid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time.\nIt was a monstrous big river down there\u2014sometimes a mile and a half wide; we\nrun nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we\nstopped navigating and tied up\u2014nearly always in the dead water under a tow-head;\nand then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we\nset out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen\nup and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about\nknee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres\u2014perfectly\nstill\u2014just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\na-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a\nkind of dull line\u2014that was the woods on t\u2019other side; you couldn\u2019t make nothing\nelse out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around;\nthen the river softened up away off, and warn\u2019t black any more, but gray; you\ncould see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away\u2014trading scows, and\nsuch things; and long black streaks\u2014rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep\nscreaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and\nby-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\nstreak that there\u2019s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and\nmakes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water,\nand the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the\nedge of the woods, away on the bank on t\u2019other side of the river, being a\nwoodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it\nanywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over\nthere, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the\nflowers; but sometimes not that way, because they\u2019ve left dead fish laying\naround, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you\u2019ve got the\nfull day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n \nA little smoke couldn\u2019t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the\nlines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch the\nlonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by-and-by lazy off to\nsleep. Wake up by-and-by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a\nsteamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you\ncouldn\u2019t tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or\nside-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn\u2019t be nothing to hear nor\nnothing to see\u2014just solid lonesomeness. Next you\u2019d see a raft sliding by, away\noff yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they\u2019re most always\ndoing it on a raft; you\u2019d see the axe flash and come down\u2014you don\u2019t hear\nnothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it\u2019s above the man\u2019s\nhead then you hear the k\u2019chunk!\u2014it had took all that time to come over\nthe water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the\nstillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by\nwas beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn\u2019t run over them. A scow or a raft\nwent by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing\u2014heard them\nplain; but we couldn\u2019t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was\nlike spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was\nspirits; but I says:\n \n\u201cNo; spirits wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Dern the dern fog.\u2019\u201d\n \nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we\nlet her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we\nlit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of\nthings\u2014we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let\nus\u2014the new clothes Buck\u2019s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and\nbesides I didn\u2019t go much on clothes, nohow.\n \nSometimes we\u2019d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time.\nYonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark\u2014which\nwas a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a\nspark or two\u2014on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle\nor a song coming over from one of them crafts. It\u2019s lovely to live on a raft.\nWe had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our\nbacks and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just\nhappened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged\nit would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a\nlaid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say nothing\nagainst it, because I\u2019ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be\ndone. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim\nallowed they\u2019d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\n \nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark,\nand now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her\nchimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then\nshe would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off\nand leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a\nlong time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you\nwouldn\u2019t hear nothing for you couldn\u2019t tell how long, except maybe frogs or\nsomething.\n \nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours\nthe shores was black\u2014no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our\nclock\u2014the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a\nplace to hide and tie up right away.\n \nOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main\nshore\u2014it was only two hundred yards\u2014and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst\nthe cypress woods, to see if I couldn\u2019t get some berries. Just as I was passing\na place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men\ntearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner,\nfor whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was me\u2014or maybe Jim.\nI was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me\nthen, and sung out and begged me to save their lives\u2014said they hadn\u2019t been\ndoing nothing, and was being chased for it\u2014said there was men and dogs\na-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you do it. I don\u2019t hear the dogs and horses yet; you\u2019ve got time to\ncrowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to\nthe water and wade down to me and get in\u2014that\u2019ll throw the dogs off the scent.\u201d\n \nThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our tow-head, and in\nabout five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting. We\nheard them come along towards the crick, but couldn\u2019t see them; they seemed to\nstop and fool around a while; then, as we got further and further away all the\ntime, we couldn\u2019t hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of\nwoods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over\nto the tow-head and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe.\n \nOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and very\ngray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue\nwoollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops,\nand home-knit galluses\u2014no, he only had one. He had an old long-tailed blue\njeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and both of them had\nbig, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\n \nThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After breakfast\nwe all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these\nchaps didn\u2019t know one another.\n \n\u201cWhat got you into trouble?\u201d says the baldhead to t\u2019other chap.\n \n\u201cWell, I\u2019d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth\u2014and it does\ntake it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it\u2014but I stayed about one\nnight longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran\nacross you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming,\nand begged me to help you to get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble\nmyself, and would scatter out with you. That\u2019s the whole yarn\u2014what\u2019s\nyourn?\n \n\u201cWell, I\u2019d ben a-runnin\u2019 a little temperance revival thar, \u2019bout a week, and\nwas the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin\u2019 it mighty warm\nfor the rummies, I tell you, and takin\u2019 as much as five or six dollars a\nnight\u2014ten cents a head, children and niggers free\u2014and business a-growin\u2019 all\nthe time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I\nhad a way of puttin\u2019 in my time with a private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted\nme out this mornin\u2019, and told me the people was getherin\u2019 on the quiet with\ntheir dogs and horses, and they\u2019d be along pretty soon and give me \u2019bout half\nan hour\u2019s start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they\u2019d\ntar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn\u2019t wait for no\nbreakfast\u2014I warn\u2019t hungry.\u201d\n \n\u201cOld man,\u201d said the young one, \u201cI reckon we might double-team it together; what\ndo you think?\u201d\n \n\u201cI ain\u2019t undisposed. What\u2019s your line\u2014mainly?\u201d\n \n\u201cJour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines; theater-actor\u2014tragedy,\nyou know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there\u2019s a chance; teach\nsinging-geography school for a change; sling a lecture sometimes\u2014oh, I do lots\nof things\u2014most anything that comes handy, so it ain\u2019t work. What\u2019s your lay?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin\u2019 on o\u2019 hands is\nmy best holt\u2014for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I k\u2019n tell a\nfortune pretty good when I\u2019ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me.\nPreachin\u2019s my line, too, and workin\u2019 camp-meetin\u2019s, and missionaryin\u2019 around.\u201d\n \nNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and\nsays:\n \n\u201cAlas!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat \u2019re you alassin\u2019 about?\u201d says the baldhead.\n \n\u201cTo think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down\ninto such company.\u201d And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.\n \n\u201cDern your skin, ain\u2019t the company good enough for you?\u201d says the baldhead,\npretty pert and uppish.\n \n\u201cYes, it is good enough for me; it\u2019s as good as I deserve; for who\nfetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don\u2019t blame\nyou, gentlemen\u2014far from it; I don\u2019t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let\nthe cold world do its worst; one thing I know\u2014there\u2019s a grave somewhere for me.\nThe world may go on just as it\u2019s always done, and take everything from me\u2014loved\nones, property, everything; but it can\u2019t take that. Some day I\u2019ll lie down in\nit and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.\u201d He went on\na-wiping.\n \n\u201cDrot your pore broken heart,\u201d says the baldhead; \u201cwhat are you heaving your\npore broken heart at us f\u2019r? We hain\u2019t done nothing.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I know you haven\u2019t. I ain\u2019t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself\ndown\u2014yes, I did it myself. It\u2019s right I should suffer\u2014perfectly right\u2014I don\u2019t\nmake any moan.\u201d\n \n\u201cBrought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?\u201d\n \n\u201cAh, you would not believe me; the world never believes\u2014let it pass\u2014\u2019tis no\nmatter. The secret of my birth\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThe secret of your birth! Do you mean to say\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d says the young man, very solemn, \u201cI will reveal it to you, for I\nfeel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!\u201d\n \nJim\u2019s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the\nbaldhead says: \u201cNo! you can\u2019t mean it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this\ncountry about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom;\nmarried here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same\ntime. The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates\u2014the infant\nreal duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant\u2014I am the\nrightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,\nhunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and\ndegraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!\u201d\n \nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said\nit warn\u2019t much use, he couldn\u2019t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to\nacknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we\nsaid we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke\nto him, and say \u201cYour Grace,\u201d or \u201cMy Lord,\u201d or \u201cYour Lordship\u201d\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t\nmind it if we called him plain \u201cBridgewater,\u201d which, he said, was a title\nanyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do\nany little thing for him he wanted done.\n \nWell, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and\nwaited on him, and says, \u201cWill yo\u2019 Grace have some o\u2019 dis or some o\u2019 dat?\u201d and\nso on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.\n \nBut the old man got pretty silent by-and-by\u2014didn\u2019t have much to say, and didn\u2019t\nlook pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that\nduke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he\nsays:\n \n\u201cLooky here, Bilgewater,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m nation sorry for you, but you ain\u2019t the\nonly person that\u2019s had troubles like that.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo you ain\u2019t. You ain\u2019t the only person that\u2019s ben snaked down wrongfully\nout\u2019n a high place.\u201d\n \n\u201cAlas!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you ain\u2019t the only person that\u2019s had a secret of his birth.\u201d And, by\njings, he begins to cry.\n \n\u201cHold! What do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cBilgewater, kin I trust you?\u201d says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n \n\u201cTo the bitter death!\u201d He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and\nsays, \u201cThat secret of your being: speak!\u201d\n \n\u201cBilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\u201d\n \nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:\n \n\u201cYou are what?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, my friend, it is too true\u2014your eyes is lookin\u2019 at this very moment on the\npore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry\nAntonette.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou! At your age! No! You mean you\u2019re the late Charlemagne; you must be six or\nseven hundred years old, at the very least.\u201d\n \n\u201cTrouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these\ngray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in\nblue jeans and misery, the wanderin\u2019, exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin\u2019\nrightful King of France.\u201d\n \nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn\u2019t know hardly what to do, we\nwas so sorry\u2014and so glad and proud we\u2019d got him with us, too. So we set in,\nlike we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said\nit warn\u2019t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any\ngood; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if\npeople treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak\nto him, and always called him \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d and waited on him first at meals,\nand didn\u2019t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to\nmajestying him, and doing this and that and t\u2019other for him, and standing up\ntill he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got\ncheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn\u2019t look a\nbit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real\nfriendly towards him, and said the duke\u2019s great-grandfather and all the other\nDukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father, and was\nallowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good\nwhile, till by-and-by the king says:\n \n\u201cLike as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft,\nBilgewater, and so what\u2019s the use o\u2019 your bein\u2019 sour? It\u2019ll only make things\noncomfortable. It ain\u2019t my fault I warn\u2019t born a duke, it ain\u2019t your fault you\nwarn\u2019t born a king\u2014so what\u2019s the use to worry? Make the best o\u2019 things the way\nyou find \u2019em, says I\u2014that\u2019s my motto. This ain\u2019t no bad thing that we\u2019ve struck\nhere\u2014plenty grub and an easy life\u2014come, give us your hand, Duke, and le\u2019s all\nbe friends.\u201d\n \nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all\nthe uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been\na miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want,\nabove all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right\nand kind towards the others.\n \nIt didn\u2019t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn\u2019t no kings nor\ndukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I never said nothing,\nnever let on; kept it to myself; it\u2019s the best way; then you don\u2019t have no\nquarrels, and don\u2019t get into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings\nand dukes, I hadn\u2019t no objections, \u2019long as it would keep peace in the family;\nand it warn\u2019t no use to tell Jim, so I didn\u2019t tell him. If I never learnt\nnothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind\nof people is to let them have their own way.\n",
        "\nThey asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up\nthe raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running\u2014was Jim a\nrunaway nigger? Says I:\n \n\u201cGoodness sakes, would a runaway nigger run south?\u201d\n \nNo, they allowed he wouldn\u2019t. I had to account for things some way, so I says:\n \n\u201cMy folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they\nall died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he \u2019lowed he\u2019d break up and\ngo down and live with Uncle Ben, who\u2019s got a little one-horse place on the\nriver, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts;\nso when he\u2019d squared up there warn\u2019t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our\nnigger, Jim. That warn\u2019t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage\nnor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he\nketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we\u2019d go down to Orleans on it.\nPa\u2019s luck didn\u2019t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft\none night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come\nup all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never\ncome up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble,\nbecause people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from\nme, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don\u2019t run daytimes no more\nnow; nights they don\u2019t bother us.\u201d\n \nThe duke says:\n \n\u201cLeave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to.\nI\u2019ll think the thing over\u2014I\u2019ll invent a plan that\u2019ll fix it. We\u2019ll let it alone\nfor to-day, because of course we don\u2019t want to go by that town yonder in\ndaylight\u2014it mightn\u2019t be healthy.\u201d\n \nTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was\nsquirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver\u2014it\nwas going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that. So the duke and the king\nwent to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a\nstraw tick better than Jim\u2019s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there\u2019s always cobs\naround about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you\nroll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead\nleaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he\nwould take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn\u2019t. He says:\n \n\u201cI should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a\ncorn-shuck bed warn\u2019t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace\u2019ll take the\nshuck bed yourself.\u201d\n \nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to\nbe some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says:\n \n\u201c\u2019Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\noppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit;\n\u2019tis my fate. I am alone in the world\u2014let me suffer; I can bear it.\u201d\n \nWe got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out\ntowards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways\nbelow the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by-and-by\u2014that\nwas the town, you know\u2014and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we\nwas three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about\nten o\u2019clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like\neverything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got\nbetter; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the\nnight. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn\u2019t a turned in anyway if\nI\u2019d had a bed, because a body don\u2019t see such a storm as that every day in the\nweek, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every\nsecond or two there\u2019d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile\naround, and you\u2019d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees\nthrashing around in the wind; then comes a h-whack!\u2014bum! bum!\nbumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum\u2014and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling\naway, and quit\u2014and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager.\nThe waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn\u2019t any clothes on,\nand didn\u2019t mind. We didn\u2019t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was\nglaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon\nenough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.\n \nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim\nhe said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good\nthat way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had\ntheir legs sprawled around so there warn\u2019t no show for me; so I laid outside\u2014I\ndidn\u2019t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn\u2019t running so high\nnow. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he\nchanged his mind, because he reckoned they warn\u2019t high enough yet to do any\nharm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along\ncomes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing.\nHe was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\n \nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by-and-by the storm\nlet up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed, I rousted him\nout and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.\n \nThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the\nduke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and\nallowed they would \u201clay out a campaign,\u201d as they called it. The duke went down\ninto his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them\nout loud. One bill said, \u201cThe celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\u201d\nwould \u201clecture on the Science of Phrenology\u201d at such and such a place, on the\nblank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and \u201cfurnish charts of character at\ntwenty-five cents apiece.\u201d The duke said that was him. In another bill\nhe was the \u201cworld-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of\nDrury Lane, London.\u201d In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other\nwonderful things, like finding water and gold with a \u201cdivining-rod,\u201d\n\u201cdissipating witch spells,\u201d and so on. By-and-by he says:\n \n\u201cBut the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards,\nRoyalty?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d says the king.\n \n\u201cYou shall, then, before you\u2019re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\u201d says the\nduke. \u201cThe first good town we come to we\u2019ll hire a hall and do the sword fight\nin Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike\nyou?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I\ndon\u2019t know nothing about play-actin\u2019, and hain\u2019t ever seen much of it. I was\ntoo small when pap used to have \u2019em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn\nme?\u201d\n \n\u201cEasy!\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right. I\u2019m jist a-freezn\u2019 for something fresh, anyway. Le\u2019s commence right\naway.\u201d\n \nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he\nwas used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\n \n\u201cBut if Juliet\u2019s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers\nis goin\u2019 to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, don\u2019t you worry; these country jakes won\u2019t ever think of that. Besides,\nyou know, you\u2019ll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world;\nJuliet\u2019s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she\u2019s\ngot on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the\nparts.\u201d\n \nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor\nfor Richard III. and t\u2019other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a\nruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book\nand read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around\nand acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give\nthe book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.\n \nThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after\ndinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight\nwithout it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town\nand fix that thing. The king allowed he would go, too, and see if he couldn\u2019t\nstrike something. We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them\nin the canoe and get some.\n \nWhen we got there there warn\u2019t nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly\ndead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back\nyard, and he said everybody that warn\u2019t too young or too sick or too old was\ngone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods. The king got the\ndirections, and allowed he\u2019d go and work that camp-meeting for all it was\nworth, and I might go, too.\n \nThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it; a little\nbit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop\u2014carpenters and printers all gone to\nthe meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had\nink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them,\nall over the walls. The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now. So me\nand the king lit out for the camp-meeting.\n \nWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most awful\nhot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around.\nThe woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the\nwagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds made out of\npoles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to\nsell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n \nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger\nand held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs,\nwith holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn\u2019t\nhave no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the\nsheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some\ngingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men\nwas barefooted, and some of the children didn\u2019t have on any clothes but just a\ntow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young\nfolks was courting on the sly.\n \nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two\nlines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so\nmany of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more\nfor them to sing\u2014and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder\nand louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.\nThen the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving\nfirst to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down\nover the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and\nshouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold\nup his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that,\nshouting, \u201cIt\u2019s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!\u201d\nAnd people would shout out, \u201cGlory!\u2014A-a-men!\u201d And so he went on, and the\npeople groaning and crying and saying amen:\n \n\u201cOh, come to the mourners\u2019 bench! come, black with sin! (amen!) come,\nsick and sore! (amen!) come, lame and halt and blind! (amen!)\ncome, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (a-a-men!) come, all that\u2019s worn\nand soiled and suffering!\u2014come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\nheart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the\ndoor of heaven stands open\u2014oh, enter in and be at rest!\u201d (a-a-men! glory,\nglory hallelujah!)\n \nAnd so on. You couldn\u2019t make out what the preacher said any more, on account of\nthe shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked\ntheir way just by main strength to the mourners\u2019 bench, with the tears running\ndown their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front\nbenches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the\nstraw, just crazy and wild.\n \nWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over\neverybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the preacher\nhe begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a\npirate\u2014been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean\u2014and his crew was\nthinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take\nout some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he\u2019d been robbed last night and put\nashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the\nblessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now,\nand happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to\nstart right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\nof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it\nbetter than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean;\nand though it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would\nget there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you thank me, don\u2019t you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear\npeople in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race,\nand that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\u201d\n \nAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out,\n\u201cTake up a collection for him, take up a collection!\u201d Well, a half a dozen made\na jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \u201cLet him pass the hat around!\u201d\nThen everybody said it, the preacher too.\n \nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and\nblessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to\nthe poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of\ngirls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he\nlet them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of\nthem he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times\u2014and he was invited to\nstay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they\u2019d\nthink it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting\nhe couldn\u2019t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian\nOcean right off and go to work on the pirates.\n \nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected\neighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a\nthree-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was\nstarting home through the woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid\nover any day he\u2019d ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn\u2019t no\nuse talking, heathens don\u2019t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a\ncamp-meeting with.\n \nThe duke was thinking he\u2019d been doing pretty well till the king come to\nshow up, but after that he didn\u2019t think so so much. He had set up and printed\noff two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office\u2014horse bills\u2014and took\nthe money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars\u2019 worth of advertisements\nfor the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay\nin advance\u2014so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but\nhe took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\npaying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual,\nbut he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as\nhe could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece\nof poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head\u2014three verses\u2014kind of\nsweet and saddish\u2014the name of it was, \u201cYes, crush, cold world, this breaking\nheart\u201d\u2014and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn\u2019t\ncharge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he\u2019d\ndone a pretty square day\u2019s work for it.\n \nThen he showed us another little job he\u2019d printed and hadn\u2019t charged for,\nbecause it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a\nstick over his shoulder, and \u201c$200 reward\u201d under it. The reading was all about\nJim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques\u2019\nplantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north,\nand whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and\nexpenses.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d says the duke, \u201cafter to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to.\nWhenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and\nlay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the\nriver, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft\non credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and\nchains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn\u2019t go well with the story\nof us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing\u2014we must\npreserve the unities, as we say on the boards.\u201d\n \nWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn\u2019t be no trouble about\nrunning daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of\nthe reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke\u2019s work in the printing office was\ngoing to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted\nto.\n \nWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o\u2019clock; then\nwe slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\u2019t hoist our lantern till\nwe was clear out of sight of it.\n \nWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\n \n\u201cHuck, does you reck\u2019n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\u2019 kings on dis trip?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d I says, \u201cI reckon not.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d says he, \u201cdat\u2019s all right, den. I doan\u2019 mine one er two kings, but\ndat\u2019s enough. Dis one\u2019s powerful drunk, en de duke ain\u2019 much better.\u201d\n \nI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear what it\nwas like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had so much\ntrouble, he\u2019d forgot it.\n",
        "\nIt was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn\u2019t tie up. The king and\nthe duke turned out by-and-by looking pretty rusty; but after they\u2019d jumped\noverboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the\nking he took a seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and\nrolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be\ncomfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by\nheart. When he had got it pretty good, him and the duke begun to practice it\ntogether. The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every\nspeech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while\nhe said he done it pretty well; \u201conly,\u201d he says, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t bellow out\nRomeo! that way, like a bull\u2014you must say it soft and sick and\nlanguishy, so\u2014R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet\u2019s a dear sweet mere child\nof a girl, you know, and she doesn\u2019t bray like a jackass.\u201d\n \nWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak\nlaths, and begun to practice the sword fight\u2014the duke called himself Richard\nIII.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see.\nBut by-and-by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a\nrest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they\u2019d had in other times\nalong the river.\n \nAfter dinner the duke says:\n \n\u201cWell, Capet, we\u2019ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess\nwe\u2019ll add a little more to it. We want a little something to answer encores\nwith, anyway.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s onkores, Bilgewater?\u201d\n \nThe duke told him, and then says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor\u2019s hornpipe; and\nyou\u2014well, let me see\u2014oh, I\u2019ve got it\u2014you can do Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy.\u201d\n \n\u201cHamlet\u2019s which?\u201d\n \n\u201cHamlet\u2019s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare. Ah,\nit\u2019s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven\u2019t got it in the\nbook\u2014I\u2019ve only got one volume\u2014but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. I\u2019ll\njust walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from\nrecollection\u2019s vaults.\u201d\n \nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now\nand then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand\non his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next\nhe\u2019d let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful to see him. By-and-by he got it.\nHe told us to give attention. Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one\nleg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back,\nlooking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth;\nand after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and\nswelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever\nI see before. This is the speech\u2014I learned it, easy enough, while he was\nlearning it to the king:\n \nTo be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\nFor who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,\nBut that the fear of something after death\nMurders the innocent sleep,\nGreat nature\u2019s second course,\nAnd makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune\nThan fly to others that we know not of.\nThere\u2019s the respect must give us pause:\nWake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor\u2019s wrong, the proud man\u2019s contumely,\nThe law\u2019s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take.\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn\nIn customary suits of solemn black,\nBut that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,\nBreathes forth contagion on the world,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i\u2019 the adage,\nIs sicklied o\u2019er with care.\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o\u2019er our housetops,\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\nAnd lose the name of action.\n\u2019Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.\nBut soft you, the fair Ophelia:\nOpe not thy ponderous and marble jaws.\nBut get thee to a nunnery\u2014go!\n \nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he could\ndo it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had his\nhand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear\nand rair up behind when he was getting it off.\n \nThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and after\nthat, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon\nlively place, for there warn\u2019t nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing\u2014as the\nduke called it\u2014going on all the time. One morning, when we was pretty well down\nthe State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big\nbend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a\ncrick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but\nJim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that\nplace for our show.\n \nWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon,\nand the country people was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old\nshackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave before night, so our show\nwould have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the court house, and we went\naround and stuck up our bills.

The stores and houses was most all old\nshackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn\u2019t ever been painted; they was set up\nthree or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the\nwater when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them,\nbut they didn\u2019t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and\nsunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of\nbottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different\nkinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way,\nand had gates that didn\u2019t generly have but one hinge\u2014a leather one. Some of the\nfences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in\nClumbus\u2019s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people\ndriving them out.\n \nAll the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front,\nand the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was\nempty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day\nlong, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping\nand yawning and stretching\u2014a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow\nstraw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn\u2019t wear no coats nor\nwaistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and\nAndy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words. There\nwas as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most\nalways had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out\nto lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all\nthe time was:\n \n\u201cGimme a chaw \u2019v tobacker, Hank.\u201d\n \n\u201cCain\u2019t; I hain\u2019t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.\u201d\n \nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain\u2019t got none. Some\nof them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco\nof their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, \u201cI\nwisht you\u2019d len\u2019 me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last\nchaw I had\u201d\u2014which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don\u2019t fool nobody but a\nstranger; but Jack ain\u2019t no stranger, so he says:\n \n\u201cYou give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister\u2019s cat\u2019s grandmother.\nYou pay me back the chaws you\u2019ve awready borry\u2019d off\u2019n me, Lafe Buckner, then\nI\u2019ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won\u2019t charge you no back intrust,\nnuther.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I did pay you back some of it wunst.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, you did\u2014\u2019bout six chaws. You borry\u2019d store tobacker and paid back\nnigger-head.\u201d\n \nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural\nleaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don\u2019t generly cut it off with a\nknife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and\ntug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the\none that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it\u2019s handed back, and says,\nsarcastic:\n \n\u201cHere, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.\u201d\n \nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn\u2019t nothing else but\nmud\u2014mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or\nthree inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around\neverywheres. You\u2019d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the\nstreet and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk\naround her, and she\u2019d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst\nthe pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty\nsoon you\u2019d hear a loafer sing out, \u201cHi! so boy! sick him, Tige!\u201d and\naway the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to\neach ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the\nloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look\ngrateful for the noise. Then they\u2019d settle back again till there was a dog\nfight. There couldn\u2019t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all\nover, like a dog fight\u2014unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and\nsetting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to\ndeath.\n \nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they\nwas bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of\nthem. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner\nwas hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because\nsometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a\nbelt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave\nalong till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has\nto be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river\u2019s always\ngnawing at it.\n \nThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and\nhorses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their\ndinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was\nconsiderable whisky drinking going on, and I seen three fights. By-and-by\nsomebody sings out:\n \n\u201cHere comes old Boggs!\u2014in from the country for his little old monthly drunk;\nhere he comes, boys!\u201d\n \nAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of\nBoggs. One of them says:\n \n\u201cWonder who he\u2019s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he\u2019d a-chawed up all the men\nhe\u2019s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he\u2019d have considerable\nruputation now.\u201d\n \nAnother one says, \u201cI wisht old Boggs \u2019d threaten me, \u2019cuz then I\u2019d know I\nwarn\u2019t gwyne to die for a thousan\u2019 year.\u201d\n \nBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an Injun,\nand singing out:\n \n\u201cCler the track, thar. I\u2019m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne\nto raise.\u201d\n \nHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and\nhad a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him,\nand he sassed back, and said he\u2019d attend to them and lay them out in their\nregular turns, but he couldn\u2019t wait now because he\u2019d come to town to kill old\nColonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \u201cMeat first, and spoon vittles to top off\non.\u201d\n \nHe see me, and rode up and says:\n \n\u201cWhar\u2019d you come f\u2019m, boy? You prepared to die?\u201d\n \nThen he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:\n \n\u201cHe don\u2019t mean nothing; he\u2019s always a-carryin\u2019 on like that when he\u2019s drunk.\nHe\u2019s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw\u2014never hurt nobody, drunk nor\nsober.\u201d\n \nBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so he\ncould see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\n \n\u201cCome out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you\u2019ve swindled. You\u2019re the\nhoun\u2019 I\u2019m after, and I\u2019m a-gwyne to have you, too!\u201d\n \nAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and\nthe whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on.\nBy-and-by a proud-looking man about fifty-five\u2014and he was a heap the best\ndressed man in that town, too\u2014steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back\non each side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca\u2019m and slow\u2014he says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m tired of this, but I\u2019ll endure it till one o\u2019clock. Till one o\u2019clock,\nmind\u2014no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you\ncan\u2019t travel so far but I will find you.\u201d\n \nThen he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and\nthere warn\u2019t no more laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as\nhe could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops\nbefore the store, still keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to\nget him to shut up, but he wouldn\u2019t; they told him it would be one o\u2019clock in\nabout fifteen minutes, and so he must go home\u2014he must go right away. But\nit didn\u2019t do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat\ndown in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\nthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a\nchance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock\nhim up and get him sober; but it warn\u2019t no use\u2014up the street he would tear\nagain, and give Sherburn another cussing. By-and-by somebody says:\n \n\u201cGo for his daughter!\u2014quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he\u2019ll listen to\nher. If anybody can persuade him, she can.\u201d\n \nSo somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped. In about\nfive or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse. He was\na-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both\nsides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and\nlooked uneasy; and he warn\u2019t hanging back any, but was doing some of the\nhurrying himself. Somebody sings out:\n \n\u201cBoggs!\u201d\n \nI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. He\nwas standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his\nright hand\u2014not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards\nthe sky. The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with\nher. Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see\nthe pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and\nsteady to a level\u2014both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and\nsays, \u201cO Lord, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\nclawing at the air\u2014bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards onto\nthe ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young girl screamed\nout and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and\nsaying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s killed him, he\u2019s killed him!\u201d The crowd closed up around\nthem, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying\nto see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, \u201cBack,\nback! give him air, give him air!\u201d\n \nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned around on\nhis heels and walked off.\n \nThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the\nsame, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the\nwindow, where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him on the floor\nand put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on\nhis breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the\nbullets went in. He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible\nup when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it\nout\u2014and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter\naway from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen,\nand very sweet and gentle-looking, but awful pale and scared.\n \nWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing\nand shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the\nplaces wouldn\u2019t give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time,\n\u201cSay, now, you\u2019ve looked enough, you fellows; \u2019tain\u2019t right and \u2019tain\u2019t fair\nfor you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks\nhas their rights as well as you.\u201d\n \nThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was\ngoing to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody\nthat seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd\npacked around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.\nOne long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the\nback of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the\nground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him\naround from one place to t\u2019other and watching everything he done, and bobbing\ntheir heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\nhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane;\nand then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and\nhaving his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, \u201cBoggs!\u201d and then fetched\nhis cane down slow to a level, and says \u201cBang!\u201d staggered backwards, says\n\u201cBang!\u201d again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the\nthing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all\nhappened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\n \nWell, by-and-by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a minute\neverybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down\nevery clothes-line they come to, to do the hanging with.\n",
        "\nThey swarmed up towards Sherburn\u2019s house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns,\nand everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it\nwas awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and\ntrying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of\nwomen\u2019s heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches\nlooking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they\nwould break and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was\ncrying and taking on, scared most to death.\n \nThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn\u2019s palings as thick as they could jam\ntogether, and you couldn\u2019t hear yourself think for the noise. It was a little\ntwenty-foot yard. Some sung out \u201cTear down the fence! tear down the fence!\u201d\nThen there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes,\nand the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.\n \nJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a\ndouble-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca\u2019m and\ndeliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.\n \nSherburn never said a word\u2014just stood there, looking down. The stillness was\nawful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and\nwherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they\ncouldn\u2019t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn\nsort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like\nwhen you are eating bread that\u2019s got sand in it.\n \nThen he says, slow and scornful:\n \n\u201cThe idea of you lynching anybody! It\u2019s amusing. The idea of you\nthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you\u2019re brave\nenough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here,\ndid that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man?\nWhy, a man\u2019s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind\u2014as long as\nit\u2019s daytime and you\u2019re not behind him.\n \n\u201cDo I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South,\nand I\u2019ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average\nman\u2019s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and\ngoes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by\nhimself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot.\nYour newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are\nbraver than any other people\u2014whereas you\u2019re just as brave, and no\nbraver. Why don\u2019t your juries hang murderers? Because they\u2019re afraid the man\u2019s\nfriends will shoot them in the back, in the dark\u2014and it\u2019s just what they\nwould do.\n \n\u201cSo they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred\nmasked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you\ndidn\u2019t bring a man with you; that\u2019s one mistake, and the other is that you\ndidn\u2019t come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought part of a\nman\u2014Buck Harkness, there\u2014and if you hadn\u2019t had him to start you, you\u2019d a taken\nit out in blowing.\n \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to come. The average man don\u2019t like trouble and danger.\nYou don\u2019t like trouble and danger. But if only half a man\u2014like\nBuck Harkness, there\u2014shouts \u2018Lynch him! lynch him!\u2019 you\u2019re afraid to back\ndown\u2014afraid you\u2019ll be found out to be what you are\u2014cowards\u2014and so you\nraise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man\u2019s coat-tail, and come\nraging up here, swearing what big things you\u2019re going to do. The pitifulest\nthing out is a mob; that\u2019s what an army is\u2014a mob; they don\u2019t fight with courage\nthat\u2019s born in them, but with courage that\u2019s borrowed from their mass, and from\ntheir officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is\nbeneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your\ntails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching\u2019s going to be done,\nit will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they\u2019ll bring\ntheir masks, and fetch a man along. Now leave\u2014and take your\nhalf-a-man with you\u201d\u2014tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when\nhe says this.\n \nThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off\nevery which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable\ncheap. I could a staid if I wanted to, but I didn\u2019t want to.\n \nI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by,\nand then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some\nother money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain\u2019t no telling\nhow soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that\nway. You can\u2019t be too careful. I ain\u2019t opposed to spending money on circuses\nwhen there ain\u2019t no other way, but there ain\u2019t no use in wasting it on\nthem.\n \nIt was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was when\nthey all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the\nmen just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and\nresting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable\u2014there must a been\ntwenty of them\u2014and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly\nbeautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed\nin clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It\nwas a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one\nthey got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy\nand graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\nheads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every\nlady\u2019s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she\nlooking like the most loveliest parasol.\n \nAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out\nin the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the\nring-master going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and\nshouting \u201cHi!\u2014hi!\u201d and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by-and-by all\nhands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every\ngentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump\nthemselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and\nmade the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped\ntheir hands and went just about wild.\n \nWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the\ntime that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ring-master\ncouldn\u2019t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the\nfunniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many\nof them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn\u2019t noway understand. Why, I\ncouldn\u2019t a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get\ninto the ring\u2014said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody\nthat ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\u2019t listen,\nand the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him\nand make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so\nthat stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\nbenches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \u201cKnock him down! throw him out!\u201d\nand one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master he made a little\nspeech, and said he hoped there wouldn\u2019t be no disturbance, and if the man\nwould promise he wouldn\u2019t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he\nthought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right,\nand the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and\njump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to\nhold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the\nair every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\ntill tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do,\nthe horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round\nthe ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first\none leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t\u2019other one on t\u2019other\nside, and the people just crazy. It warn\u2019t funny to me, though; I was all of a\ntremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and\ngrabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung\nup and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\ntoo. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he\nwarn\u2019t ever drunk in his life\u2014and then he begun to pull off his clothes and\nsling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and\naltogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome,\nand dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse\nwith his whip and made him fairly hum\u2014and finally skipped off, and made his bow\nand danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure\nand astonishment.\n \nThen the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the\nsickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He\nhad got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well,\nI felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn\u2019t a been in that\nring-master\u2019s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don\u2019t know; there may be\nbullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways,\nit was plenty good enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can\nhave all of my custom every time.\n \nWell, that night we had our show; but there warn\u2019t only about twelve\npeople there\u2014just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and\nthat made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over,\nbut one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads\ncouldn\u2019t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy\u2014and maybe\nsomething ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size\ntheir style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some\nblack paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the\nvillage. The bills said:\n \nAT THE COURT HOUSE!\nFOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY!\nThe World-Renowned Tragedians\nDAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!\nAND\nEDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!\nOf the London and Continental\nTheatres,\nIn their Thrilling Tragedy of\nTHE KING\u2019S CAMELOPARD\nOR\nTHE ROYAL NONESUCH!!!\nAdmission 50 cents.\n \nThen at the bottom was the biggest line of all\u2014which said:\n \nLADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.\n \n\u201cThere,\u201d says he, \u201cif that line don\u2019t fetch them, I dont know Arkansaw!\u201d\n",
        "\nWell, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain\nand a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of\nmen in no time. When the place couldn\u2019t hold no more, the duke he quit tending\ndoor and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before\nthe curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it\nwas the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about\nthe tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main\nprincipal part in it; and at last when he\u2019d got everybody\u2019s expectations up\nhigh enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come\na-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,\nring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.\nAnd\u2014but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful\nfunny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done\ncapering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed\nand haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they\nmade him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines\nthat old idiot cut.\n \nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the\ngreat tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing\nLondon engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane;\nand then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing\nthem and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it\nto their friends and get them to come and see it.\n \nTwenty people sings out:\n \n\u201cWhat, is it over? Is that all?\u201d\n \nThe duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out, \u201cSold!\u201d and\nrose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians. But a big,\nfine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:\n \n\u201cHold on! Just a word, gentlemen.\u201d They stopped to listen. \u201cWe are sold\u2014mighty\nbadly sold. But we don\u2019t want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I\nreckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. No.\nWhat we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the\nrest of the town! Then we\u2019ll all be in the same boat. Ain\u2019t that\nsensible?\u201d (\u201cYou bet it is!\u2014the jedge is right!\u201d everybody sings out.) \u201cAll\nright, then\u2014not a word about any sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to\ncome and see the tragedy.\u201d\n \nNext day you couldn\u2019t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show\nwas. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.\nWhen me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and\nby-and-by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down\nthe middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below\ntown.\n \nThe third night the house was crammed again\u2014and they warn\u2019t new-comers this\ntime, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I stood by the duke\nat the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or\nsomething muffled up under his coat\u2014and I see it warn\u2019t no perfumery, neither,\nnot by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages,\nand such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet\nI do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but\nit was too various for me; I couldn\u2019t stand it. Well, when the place couldn\u2019t\nhold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend\ndoor for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after\nhim; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:\n \n\u201cWalk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft\nlike the dickens was after you!\u201d\n \nI done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time, and in\nless than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and\nedging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the\npoor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the\nsort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:\n \n\u201cWell, how\u2019d the old thing pan out this time, duke?\u201d\n \nHe hadn\u2019t been up town at all.\n \nWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we\nlit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones\nloose over the way they\u2019d served them people. The duke says:\n \n\u201cGreenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let\nthe rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they\u2019d lay for us the third\nnight, and consider it was their turn now. Well, it is their\nturn, and I\u2019d give something to know how much they\u2019d take for it. I\nwould just like to know how they\u2019re putting in their opportunity. They\ncan turn it into a picnic if they want to\u2014they brought plenty provisions.\u201d\n \nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three\nnights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before.\nBy-and-by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t it s\u2019prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d I says, \u201cit don\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t it, Huck?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it don\u2019t, because it\u2019s in the breed. I reckon they\u2019re all alike.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, Huck, dese kings o\u2019 ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat\u2019s jist what dey is;\ndey\u2019s reglar rapscallions.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I\ncan make out.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs dat so?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou read about them once\u2014you\u2019ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this\u2019n \u2019s a\nSunday-school Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and\nLouis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and\nRichard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to\nrip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the\nEight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new\nwife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as\nindifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. \u2018Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\u2019 he says. They\nfetch her up. Next morning, \u2018Chop off her head!\u2019 And they chop it off. \u2018Fetch\nup Jane Shore,\u2019 he says; and up she comes, Next morning, \u2018Chop off her\nhead\u2019\u2014and they chop it off. \u2018Ring up Fair Rosamun.\u2019 Fair Rosamun answers the\nbell. Next morning, \u2018Chop off her head.\u2019 And he made every one of them tell him\na tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one\ntales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday\nBook\u2014which was a good name and stated the case. You don\u2019t know kings, Jim, but\nI know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I\u2019ve struck in\nhistory. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with\nthis country. How does he go at it\u2014give notice?\u2014give the country a show? No.\nAll of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks\nout a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was\nhis style\u2014he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his\nfather, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up?\nNo\u2014drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S\u2019pose people left money\nlaying around where he was\u2014what did he do? He collared it. S\u2019pose he contracted\nto do a thing, and you paid him, and didn\u2019t set down there and see that he done\nit\u2014what did he do? He always done the other thing. S\u2019pose he opened his\nmouth\u2014what then? If he didn\u2019t shut it up powerful quick he\u2019d lose a lie every\ntime. That\u2019s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we\u2019d a had him along \u2019stead of\nour kings he\u2019d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don\u2019t say that\nourn is lambs, because they ain\u2019t, when you come right down to the cold facts;\nbut they ain\u2019t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is\nkings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they\u2019re a mighty\nornery lot. It\u2019s the way they\u2019re raised.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they all do, Jim. We can\u2019t help the way a king smells; history\ndon\u2019t tell no way.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow de duke, he\u2019s a tolerble likely man in some ways.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, a duke\u2019s different. But not very different. This one\u2019s a middling hard\nlot for a duke. When he\u2019s drunk, there ain\u2019t no near-sighted man could tell him\nfrom a king.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, anyways, I doan\u2019 hanker for no mo\u2019 un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin\nstan\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we\u2019ve got them on our hands, and we got to\nremember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of\na country that\u2019s out of kings.\u201d\n \nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn\u2019t real kings and dukes? It wouldn\u2019t a\ndone no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you couldn\u2019t tell them from\nthe real kind.\n \nI went to sleep, and Jim didn\u2019t call me when it was my turn. He often done\nthat. When I waked up just at daybreak, he was sitting there with his head down\nbetwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn\u2019t take notice nor\nlet on. I knowed what it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his\nchildren, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn\u2019t ever\nbeen away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much\nfor his people as white folks does for their\u2019n. It don\u2019t seem natural, but I\nreckon it\u2019s so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he\njudged I was asleep, and saying, \u201cPo\u2019 little \u2019Lizabeth! po\u2019 little Johnny! it\u2019s\nmighty hard; I spec\u2019 I ain\u2019t ever gwyne to see you no mo\u2019, no mo\u2019!\u201d He was a\nmighty good nigger, Jim was.\n \nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones;\nand by-and-by he says:\n \n\u201cWhat makes me feel so bad dis time \u2019uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de\nbank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my\nlittle \u2019Lizabeth so ornery. She warn\u2019t on\u2019y \u2019bout fo\u2019 year ole, en she tuck de\nsk\u2019yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she\nwas a-stannin\u2019 aroun\u2019, en I says to her, I says:\n \n\u201c\u2018Shet de do\u2019.\u2019\n \n\u201cShe never done it; jis\u2019 stood dah, kiner smilin\u2019 up at me. It make me mad; en\nI says agin, mighty loud, I says:\n \n\u201c\u2018Doan\u2019 you hear me?\u2014shet de do\u2019!\u2019\n \n\u201cShe jis stood de same way, kiner smilin\u2019 up. I was a-bilin\u2019! I says:\n \n\u201c\u2018I lay I make you mine!\u2019\n \n\u201cEn wid dat I fetch\u2019 her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin\u2019. Den I\nwent into de yuther room, en \u2019uz gone \u2019bout ten minutes; en when I come back\ndah was dat do\u2019 a-stannin\u2019 open yit, en dat chile stannin\u2019 mos\u2019 right in\nit, a-lookin\u2019 down and mournin\u2019, en de tears runnin\u2019 down. My, but I wuz\nmad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis\u2019 den\u2014it was a do\u2019 dat open\ninnerds\u2014jis\u2019 den, \u2019long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile,\nker-blam!\u2014en my lan\u2019, de chile never move\u2019! My breff mos\u2019 hop outer me;\nen I feel so\u2014so\u2014I doan\u2019 know how I feel. I crope out, all a-tremblin\u2019,\nen crope aroun\u2019 en open de do\u2019 easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de\nchile, sof\u2019 en still, en all uv a sudden I says pow! jis\u2019 as loud as I\ncould yell. She never budge! Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin\u2019 en grab her\nup in my arms, en say, \u2018Oh, de po\u2019 little thing! De Lord God Amighty fogive po\u2019\nole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long\u2019s he live!\u2019 Oh, she was\nplumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb\u2014en I\u2019d ben a-treat\u2019n her so!\u201d\n",
        "\nNext day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow tow-head out in the\nmiddle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and\nthe king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the\nduke, and said he hoped it wouldn\u2019t take but a few hours, because it got mighty\nheavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with\nthe rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if\nanybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn\u2019t look much\nlike he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of\nhard to have to lay roped all day, and he\u2019d cipher out some way to get around\nit.\n \nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up\nin King Lear\u2019s outfit\u2014it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair\nwig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim\u2019s face and\nhands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that\u2019s\nbeen drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn\u2019t the horriblest looking outrage I\never see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n \nSick Arab\u2014but harmless when not out of his head.\n \nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot\nin front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than\nlying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there\nwas a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody\never come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a\nlittle, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would\nlight out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take\nthe average man, and he wouldn\u2019t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn\u2019t only look\nlike he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n \nThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much\nmoney in it, but they judged it wouldn\u2019t be safe, because maybe the news might\na worked along down by this time. They couldn\u2019t hit no project that suited\nexactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he\u2019d lay off and work his brains\nan hour or two and see if he couldn\u2019t put up something on the Arkansaw village;\nand the king he allowed he would drop over to t\u2019other village without any plan,\nbut just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way\u2014meaning the devil,\nI reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the\nking put his\u2019n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The\nking\u2019s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never\nknowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the\norneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he\u2019d take off his new white\nbeaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious\nthat you\u2019d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus\nhimself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big\nsteamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above\nthe town\u2014been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:\n \n\u201cSeein\u2019 how I\u2019m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or\nCincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we\u2019ll\ncome down to the village on her.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched\nthe shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the\nbluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking\nyoung country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it\nwas powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.\n \n\u201cRun her nose in shore,\u201d says the king. I done it. \u201cWher\u2019 you bound for, young\nman?\u201d\n \n\u201cFor the steamboat; going to Orleans.\u201d\n \n\u201cGit aboard,\u201d says the king. \u201cHold on a minute, my servant \u2019ll he\u2019p you with\nthem bags. Jump out and he\u2019p the gentleman, Adolphus\u201d\u2014meaning me, I see.\n \nI done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty\nthankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the\nking where he was going, and the king told him he\u2019d come down the river and\nlanded at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to\nsee an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:\n \n\u201cWhen I first see you I says to myself, \u2018It\u2019s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come\nmighty near getting here in time.\u2019 But then I says again, \u2018No, I reckon it\nain\u2019t him, or else he wouldn\u2019t be paddling up the river.\u2019 You ain\u2019t him,\nare you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, my name\u2019s Blodgett\u2014Elexander Blodgett\u2014Reverend Elexander Blodgett,\nI s\u2019pose I must say, as I\u2019m one o\u2019 the Lord\u2019s poor servants. But still I\u2019m jist\nas able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if\nhe\u2019s missed anything by it\u2014which I hope he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, he don\u2019t miss any property by it, because he\u2019ll get that all right; but\nhe\u2019s missed seeing his brother Peter die\u2014which he mayn\u2019t mind, nobody can tell\nas to that\u2014but his brother would a give anything in this world to see\nhim before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three\nweeks; hadn\u2019t seen him since they was boys together\u2014and hadn\u2019t ever seen his\nbrother William at all\u2014that\u2019s the deef and dumb one\u2014William ain\u2019t more than\nthirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here;\nGeorge was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey\nand William\u2019s the only ones that\u2019s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven\u2019t\ngot here in time.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid anybody send \u2019em word?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said\nthen that he sorter felt like he warn\u2019t going to get well this time. You see,\nhe was pretty old, and George\u2019s g\u2019yirls was too young to be much company for\nhim, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after\nGeorge and his wife died, and didn\u2019t seem to care much to live. He most\ndesperately wanted to see Harvey\u2014and William, too, for that matter\u2014because he\nwas one of them kind that can\u2019t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind\nfor Harvey, and said he\u2019d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted\nthe rest of the property divided up so George\u2019s g\u2019yirls would be all right\u2014for\nGeorge didn\u2019t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put\na pen to.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy do you reckon Harvey don\u2019t come? Wher\u2019 does he live?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, he lives in England\u2014Sheffield\u2014preaches there\u2014hasn\u2019t ever been in this\ncountry. He hasn\u2019t had any too much time\u2014and besides he mightn\u2019t a got the\nletter at all, you know.\u201d\n \n\u201cToo bad, too bad he couldn\u2019t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going\nto Orleans, you say?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, but that ain\u2019t only a part of it. I\u2019m going in a ship, next Wednesday,\nfor Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty long journey. But it\u2019ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary\nJane the oldest? How old is the others?\u201d\n \n\u201cMary Jane\u2019s nineteen, Susan\u2019s fifteen, and Joanna\u2019s about fourteen\u2014that\u2019s the\none that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.\u201d\n \n\u201cPoor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain\u2019t going to\nlet them come to no harm. There\u2019s Hobson, the Babtis\u2019 preacher; and Deacon Lot\nHovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and\nDr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and\u2014well, there\u2019s a lot\nof them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write\nabout sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey \u2019ll know where to look for\nfriends when he gets here.\u201d\n \nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that\nyoung fellow. Blamed if he didn\u2019t inquire about everybody and everything in\nthat blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter\u2019s business\u2014which\nwas a tanner; and about George\u2019s\u2014which was a carpenter; and about\nHarvey\u2019s\u2014which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:\n \n\u201cWhat did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause she\u2019s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn\u2019t stop there.\nWhen they\u2019re deep they won\u2019t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this\nis a St. Louis one.\u201d\n \n\u201cWas Peter Wilks well off?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it\u2019s reckoned he left\nthree or four thousand in cash hid up som\u2019ers.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen did you say he died?\u201d\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t say, but it was last night.\u201d\n \n\u201cFuneral to-morrow, likely?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, \u2019bout the middle of the day.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s all terrible sad; but we\u2019ve all got to go, one time or another. So\nwhat we want to do is to be prepared; then we\u2019re all right.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, it\u2019s the best way. Ma used to always say that.\u201d\n \nWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got\noff. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after\nall. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a\nlonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\n \n\u201cNow hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\ncarpet-bags. And if he\u2019s gone over to t\u2019other side, go over there and git him.\nAnd tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\u201d\n \nI see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got\nback with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the\nking told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it\u2014every last\nword of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an\nEnglishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can\u2019t imitate him,\nand so I ain\u2019t a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he\nsays:\n \n\u201cHow are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\u201d\n \nThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb\nperson on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a steamboat.\n \nAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they\ndidn\u2019t come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and\nthey hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from\nCincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was\nbooming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn\u2019t land us. But the\nking was ca\u2019m. He says:\n \n\u201cIf gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put\noff in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry \u2019em, can\u2019t it?\u201d\n \nSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village\nthey yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl\na-coming, and when the king says:\n \n\u201cKin any of you gentlemen tell me wher\u2019 Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\u201d they give a\nglance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, \u201cWhat d\u2019 I\ntell you?\u201d Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live\nyesterday evening.\u201d\n \nSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against\nthe man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:\n \n\u201cAlas, alas, our poor brother\u2014gone, and we never got to see him; oh, it\u2019s too,\ntoo hard!\u201d\n \nThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke\non his hands, and blamed if he didn\u2019t drop a carpet-bag and bust out\na-crying. If they warn\u2019t the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I\nstruck.\n \nWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of\nkind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and\nlet them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother\u2019s last\nmoments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and\nboth of them took on about that dead tanner like they\u2019d lost the twelve\ndisciples. Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I\u2019m a nigger. It was enough\nto make a body ashamed of the human race.\n",
        "\nThe news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing\ndown on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as\nthey come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the\ntramping was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and\nevery minute somebody would say, over a fence:\n \n\u201cIs it them?\u201d\n \nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\n \n\u201cYou bet it is.\u201d\n \nWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three\ngirls was standing in the door. Mary Jane was red-headed, but that don\u2019t\nmake no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was\nall lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread\nhis arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the\nduke, and there they had it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for\njoy to see them meet again at last and have such good times.\n \nThen the king he hunched the duke private\u2014I see him do it\u2014and then he looked\naround and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him and\nthe duke, with a hand across each other\u2019s shoulder, and t\u2019other hand to their\neyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them\nroom, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying \u201cSh!\u201d and all the men\ntaking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin\nfall. And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took\none sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to\nOrleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\u2019s necks, and hung\ntheir chins over each other\u2019s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe\nfour, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was\ndoing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it. Then\none of them got on one side of the coffin, and t\u2019other on t\u2019other side, and\nthey kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray\nall to themselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\nnever see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right\nout loud\u2014the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls,\nwithout saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put\ntheir hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running\ndown, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next\nwoman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.\n \nWell, by-and-by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works\nhimself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about\nits being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and\nto miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but\nit\u2019s a trial that\u2019s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and\nthese holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his\nbrother\u2019s heart, because out of their mouths they can\u2019t, words being too weak\nand cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and\nthen he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes\nto crying fit to bust.\n \nAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd\nstruck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it\njust warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out. Music\nis a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see\nit freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.\n \nThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces\nwould be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take\nsupper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the\ndiseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who\nhe would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned\noften in his letters; and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows,\nvizz.:\u2014Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner\nShackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow\nBartley.\n \nRev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\ntogether\u2014that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t\u2019other world,\nand the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville\non business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands\nwith the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with\nthe duke and didn\u2019t say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their\nheads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his\nhands and said \u201cGoo-goo\u2014goo-goo-goo\u201d all the time, like a baby that can\u2019t talk.\n \nSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much\neverybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little\nthings that happened one time or another in the town, or to George\u2019s family, or\nto Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a\nlie: he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed\nup to the steamboat.\n \nThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king he\nread it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house and three\nthousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard (which was doing\na good business), along with some other houses and land (worth about seven\nthousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told\nwhere the six thousand cash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said\nthey\u2019d go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told\nme to come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they\nfound the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all\nthem yaller-boys. My, the way the king\u2019s eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on\nthe shoulder and says:\n \n\u201cOh, this ain\u2019t bully nor noth\u2019n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why,\nBilji, it beats the Nonesuch, don\u2019t it?\u201d\n \nThe duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through\ntheir fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says:\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no use talkin\u2019; bein\u2019 brothers to a rich dead man and representatives\nof furrin heirs that\u2019s got left is the line for you and me, Bilge. Thish yer\ncomes of trust\u2019n to Providence. It\u2019s the best way, in the long run. I\u2019ve tried\n\u2019em all, and ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no better way.\u201d\n \nMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but\nno, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and\nfifteen dollars short. Says the king:\n \n\u201cDern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?\u201d\n \nThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then the duke\nsays:\n \n\u201cWell, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake\u2014I reckon that\u2019s\nthe way of it. The best way\u2019s to let it go, and keep still about it. We can\nspare it.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, shucks, yes, we can spare it. I don\u2019t k\u2019yer noth\u2019n \u2019bout that\u2014it\u2019s\nthe count I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 about. We want to be awful square and open and\nabove-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count\nit before everybody\u2014then ther\u2019 ain\u2019t noth\u2019n suspicious. But when the dead man\nsays ther\u2019s six thous\u2019n dollars, you know, we don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHold on,\u201d says the duke. \u201cLe\u2019s make up the deffisit,\u201d and he begun to haul out\nyaller-boys out of his pocket.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a most amaz\u2019n\u2019 good idea, duke\u2014you have got a rattlin\u2019 clever head\non you,\u201d says the king. \u201cBlest if the old Nonesuch ain\u2019t a heppin\u2019 us out\nagin,\u201d and he begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.\n \nIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.\n \n\u201cSay,\u201d says the duke, \u201cI got another idea. Le\u2019s go up stairs and count this\nmoney, and then take and give it to the girls.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood land, duke, lemme hug you! It\u2019s the most dazzling idea \u2019at ever a man\nstruck. You have cert\u2019nly got the most astonishin\u2019 head I ever see. Oh, this is\nthe boss dodge, ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no mistake \u2019bout it. Let \u2019em fetch along their\nsuspicions now if they want to\u2014this\u2019ll lay \u2019em out.\u201d\n \nWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he\ncounted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile\u2014twenty elegant\nlittle piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Then they\nraked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for\nanother speech. He says:\n \n\u201cFriends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that\u2019s\nleft behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by these yer poor\nlittle lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that\u2019s left fatherless and\nmotherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he would a done more\ngenerous by \u2019em if he hadn\u2019t ben afeard o\u2019 woundin\u2019 his dear William and me.\nNow, wouldn\u2019t he? Ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no question \u2019bout it in my mind.\nWell, then, what kind o\u2019 brothers would it be that \u2019d stand in his way at sech\na time? And what kind o\u2019 uncles would it be that \u2019d rob\u2014yes, rob\u2014sech\npoor sweet lambs as these \u2019at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William\u2014and\nI think I do\u2014he\u2014well, I\u2019ll jest ask him.\u201d He turns around and begins to\nmake a lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him\nstupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\nmeaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and\nhugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says, \u201cI knowed\nit; I reckon that\u2019ll convince anybody the way he feels about it.\nHere, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money\u2014take it all. It\u2019s the\ngift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.\u201d\n \nMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and then\nsuch another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded up with\nthe tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying\nall the time:\n \n\u201cYou dear good souls!\u2014how lovely!\u2014how could you!\u201d\n \nWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and\nhow good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big\niron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and\nlooking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either,\nbecause the king was talking and they was all busy listening. The king was\nsaying\u2014in the middle of something he\u2019d started in on\u2014\n \n\u201c\u2014they bein\u2019 partickler friends o\u2019 the diseased. That\u2019s why they\u2019re invited\nhere this evenin\u2019; but tomorrow we want all to come\u2014everybody; for he\nrespected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it\u2019s fitten that his funeral\norgies sh\u2019d be public.\u201d\n \nAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every\nlittle while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn\u2019t\nstand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper, \u201cobsequies,\nyou old fool,\u201d and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over\npeople\u2019s heads to him. The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and\nsays:\n \n\u201cPoor William, afflicted as he is, his heart\u2019s aluz right. Asks me to\ninvite everybody to come to the funeral\u2014wants me to make \u2019em all welcome. But\nhe needn\u2019t a worried\u2014it was jest what I was at.\u201d\n \nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca\u2019m, and goes to dropping in his funeral\norgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it\nthe third time he says:\n \n\u201cI say orgies, not because it\u2019s the common term, because it ain\u2019t\u2014obsequies\nbein\u2019 the common term\u2014but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain\u2019t\nused in England no more now\u2014it\u2019s gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies\nis better, because it means the thing you\u2019re after more exact. It\u2019s a word\nthat\u2019s made up out\u2019n the Greek orgo, outside, open, abroad; and the\nHebrew jeesum, to plant, cover up; hence inter. So, you see,\nfuneral orgies is an open er public funeral.\u201d\n \nHe was the worst I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed\nright in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, \u201cWhy, doctor!\u201d\nand Abner Shackleford says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Robinson, hain\u2019t you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.\u201d\n \nThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:\n \n\u201cIs it my poor brother\u2019s dear good friend and physician? I\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cKeep your hands off of me!\u201d says the doctor. \u201cYou talk like an\nEnglishman, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s the worst imitation I ever heard. You\nPeter Wilks\u2019s brother! You\u2019re a fraud, that\u2019s what you are!\u201d\n \nWell, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet\nhim down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey \u2019d showed in\nforty ways that he was Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the\nnames of the very dogs, and begged and begged him not to hurt Harvey\u2019s\nfeelings and the poor girl\u2019s feelings, and all that. But it warn\u2019t no use; he\nstormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and\ncouldn\u2019t imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar.\nThe poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the\ndoctor ups and turns on them. He says:\n \n\u201cI was your father\u2019s friend, and I\u2019m your friend; and I warn you as a\nfriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm\nand trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with\nhim, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it. He\nis the thinnest kind of an impostor\u2014has come here with a lot of empty names and\nfacts which he picked up somewheres, and you take them for proofs, and\nare helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know\nbetter. Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish\nfriend, too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out\u2014I beg you to\ndo it. Will you?\u201d\n \nMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She says:\n \n\u201cHere is my answer.\u201d She hove up the bag of money and put it in the\nking\u2019s hands, and says, \u201cTake this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and\nmy sisters any way you want to, and don\u2019t give us no receipt for it.\u201d\n \nThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the hare-lip\ndone the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the\nfloor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud.\nThe doctor says:\n \n\u201cAll right; I wash my hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a\ntime \u2019s coming when you\u2019re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day.\u201d\nAnd away he went.\n \n\u201cAll right, doctor,\u201d says the king, kinder mocking him; \u201cwe\u2019ll try and get \u2019em\nto send for you;\u201d which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good\nhit.\n",
        "\nWell, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for\nspare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for Uncle\nWilliam, and she\u2019d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little\nbigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot;\nand up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king said the cubby\nwould do for his valley\u2014meaning me.\n \nSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain but\nnice. She said she\u2019d have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her\nroom if they was in Uncle Harvey\u2019s way, but he said they warn\u2019t. The frocks was\nhung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung\ndown to the floor. There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box\nin another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like\ngirls brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and more\npleasanter for these fixings, and so don\u2019t disturb them. The duke\u2019s room was\npretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.\n \nThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I\nstood behind the king and the duke\u2019s chairs and waited on them, and the niggers\nwaited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan\nalongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves\nwas, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was\u2014and all that kind of rot,\nthe way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed\neverything was tiptop, and said so\u2014said \u201cHow do you get biscuits to\nbrown so nice?\u201d and \u201cWhere, for the land\u2019s sake, did you get these\namaz\u2019n pickles?\u201d and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people\nalways does at a supper, you know.\n \nAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of\nthe leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things.\nThe hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn\u2019t think\nthe ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says:\n \n\u201cDid you ever see the king?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have\u2014he goes to our church.\u201d I knowed he\nwas dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church,\nshe says:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2014regular?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014regular. His pew\u2019s right over opposite ourn\u2014on t\u2019other side the pulpit.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought he lived in London?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, he does. Where would he live?\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I thought you lived in Sheffield?\u201d\n \nI see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so\nas to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\n \n\u201cI mean he goes to our church regular when he\u2019s in Sheffield. That\u2019s only in\nthe summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, how you talk\u2014Sheffield ain\u2019t on the sea.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, who said it was?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, you did.\u201d\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t nuther.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou did!\u201d\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou did.\u201d\n \n\u201cI never said nothing of the kind.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, what did you say, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cSaid he come to take the sea baths\u2014that\u2019s what I said.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, how\u2019s he going to take the sea baths if it ain\u2019t on the sea?\u201d\n \n\u201cLooky here,\u201d I says; \u201cdid you ever see any Congress-water?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, no.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow does he get it, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cGets it the way people down here gets Congress-water\u2014in barrels. There in the\npalace at Sheffield they\u2019ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They\ncan\u2019t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven\u2019t got no\nconveniences for it.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.\u201d\n \nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable\nand glad. Next, she says:\n \n\u201cDo you go to church, too?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014regular.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere do you set?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, in our pew.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhose pew?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, ourn\u2014your Uncle Harvey\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis\u2019n? What does he want with a pew?\u201d\n \n\u201cWants it to set in. What did you reckon he wanted with it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I thought he\u2019d be in the pulpit.\u201d\n \nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played\nanother chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\n \n\u201cBlame it, do you suppose there ain\u2019t but one preacher to a church?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, what do they want with more?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat!\u2014to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don\u2019t\nhave no less than seventeen.\u201d\n \n\u201cSeventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn\u2019t set out such a string as that, not if I\nnever got to glory. It must take \u2019em a week.\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks, they don\u2019t all of \u2019em preach the same day\u2014only one of\n\u2019em.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what does the rest of \u2019em do?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate\u2014and one thing or another. But\nmainly they don\u2019t do nothing.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what are they for?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, they\u2019re for style. Don\u2019t you know nothing?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants\ntreated in England? Do they treat \u2019em better \u2019n we treat our niggers?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! A servant ain\u2019t nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t they give \u2019em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year\u2019s week,\nand Fourth of July?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, just listen! A body could tell you hain\u2019t ever been to England by\nthat. Why, Hare-l\u2014why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year\u2019s end to\nyear\u2019s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor\nnowheres.\u201d\n \n\u201cNor church?\u201d\n \n\u201cNor church.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you always went to church.\u201d\n \nWell, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man\u2019s servant. But next\nminute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from\na common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not,\nand set with the family, on account of its being the law. But I didn\u2019t do it\npretty good, and when I got done I see she warn\u2019t satisfied. She says:\n \n\u201cHonest injun, now, hain\u2019t you been telling me a lot of lies?\u201d\n \n\u201cHonest injun,\u201d says I.\n \n\u201cNone of it at all?\u201d\n \n\u201cNone of it at all. Not a lie in it,\u201d says I.\n \n\u201cLay your hand on this book and say it.\u201d\n \nI see it warn\u2019t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it.\nSo then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:\n \n\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I\u2019ll believe\nthe rest.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it you won\u2019t believe, Joe?\u201d says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan\nbehind her. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a\nstranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be treated so?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s always your way, Maim\u2014always sailing in to help somebody before they\u2019re\nhurt. I hain\u2019t done nothing to him. He\u2019s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I\nsaid I wouldn\u2019t swallow it all; and that\u2019s every bit and grain I did\nsay. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can\u2019t he?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t care whether \u2019twas little or whether \u2019twas big; he\u2019s here in our house\nand a stranger, and it wasn\u2019t good of you to say it. If you was in his place it\nwould make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn\u2019t to say a thing to another\nperson that will make them feel ashamed.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Mam, he said\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cIt don\u2019t make no difference what he said\u2014that ain\u2019t the thing. The\nthing is for you to treat him kind, and not be saying things to make him\nremember he ain\u2019t in his own country and amongst his own folks.\u201d\n \nI says to myself, this is a girl that I\u2019m letting that old reptile rob\nher of her money!\n \nThen Susan she waltzed in; and if you\u2019ll believe me, she did give\nHare-lip hark from the tomb!\n \nSays I to myself, and this is another one that I\u2019m letting him rob her\nof her money!\n \nThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely\nagain\u2014which was her way; but when she got done there warn\u2019t hardly anything\nleft o\u2019 poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.\n \n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d says the other girls; \u201cyou just ask his pardon.\u201d\n \nShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was\ngood to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it\nagain.\n \nI says to myself, this is another one that I\u2019m letting him rob her of\nher money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make\nme feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down\nand mean that I says to myself, my mind\u2019s made up; I\u2019ll hive that money for\nthem or bust.\n \nSo then I lit out\u2014for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by\nmyself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that\ndoctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No\u2014that won\u2019t do. He might tell who\ntold him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go,\nprivate, and tell Mary Jane? No\u2014I dasn\u2019t do it. Her face would give them a\nhint, sure; they\u2019ve got the money, and they\u2019d slide right out and get away with\nit. If she was to fetch in help I\u2019d get mixed up in the business before it was\ndone with, I judge. No; there ain\u2019t no good way but one. I got to steal that\nmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won\u2019t suspicion that I\ndone it. They\u2019ve got a good thing here, and they ain\u2019t a-going to leave till\nthey\u2019ve played this family and this town for all they\u2019re worth, so I\u2019ll find a\nchance time enough. I\u2019ll steal it and hide it; and by-and-by, when I\u2019m away\ndown the river, I\u2019ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it\u2019s hid. But I\nbetter hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn\u2019t let up as much\nas he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.\n \nSo, thinks I, I\u2019ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I\nfound the duke\u2019s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I\nrecollected it wouldn\u2019t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of\nthat money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around\nthere. But I see I couldn\u2019t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn\u2019t light\none, of course. So I judged I\u2019d got to do the other thing\u2014lay for them and\neavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to\nskip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn\u2019t where I thought it would\nbe; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane\u2019s frocks, so I jumped in\nbehind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n \nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get\ndown and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn\u2019t found the bed when I\nwanted it. And yet, you know, it\u2019s kind of natural to hide under the bed when\nyou are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says:\n \n\u201cWell, what is it? And cut it middlin\u2019 short, because it\u2019s better for us to be\ndown there a-whoopin\u2019 up the mournin\u2019 than up here givin\u2019 \u2019em a chance to talk\nus over.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, this is it, Capet. I ain\u2019t easy; I ain\u2019t comfortable. That doctor lays\non my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I\u2019ve got a notion, and I think it\u2019s a\nsound one.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it, duke?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down\nthe river with what we\u2019ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy\u2014given\nback to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to\nhave to steal it back. I\u2019m for knocking off and lighting out.\u201d\n \nThat made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been a little\ndifferent, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and\nsays:\n \n\u201cWhat! And not sell out the rest o\u2019 the property? March off like a passel of\nfools and leave eight or nine thous\u2019n\u2019 dollars\u2019 worth o\u2019 property layin\u2019 around\njest sufferin\u2019 to be scooped in?\u2014and all good, salable stuff, too.\u201d\n \nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn\u2019t want to go\nno deeper\u2014didn\u2019t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.\n \n\u201cWhy, how you talk!\u201d says the king. \u201cWe sha\u2019n\u2019t rob \u2019em of nothing at all but\njest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff\u2019rers;\nbecause as soon \u2019s it\u2019s found out \u2019at we didn\u2019t own it\u2014which won\u2019t be long\nafter we\u2019ve slid\u2014the sale won\u2019t be valid, and it\u2019ll all go back to the estate.\nThese yer orphans \u2019ll git their house back agin, and that\u2019s enough for\nthem; they\u2019re young and spry, and k\u2019n easy earn a livin\u2019. They\nain\u2019t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think\u2014there\u2019s thous\u2019n\u2019s and thous\u2019n\u2019s that\nain\u2019t nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain\u2019t got noth\u2019n\u2019 to complain\nof.\u201d\n \nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right,\nbut said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging\nover them. But the king says:\n \n\u201cCuss the doctor! What do we k\u2019yer for him? Hain\u2019t we got all the fools\nin town on our side? And ain\u2019t that a big enough majority in any town?\u201d\n \nSo they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we put that money in a good place.\u201d\n \nThat cheered me up. I\u2019d begun to think I warn\u2019t going to get a hint of no kind\nto help me. The king says:\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause Mary Jane \u2019ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the\nnigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put\n\u2019em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some\nof it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYour head\u2019s level agin, duke,\u201d says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under\nthe curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall and\nkept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say\nto me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I\u2019d better do if they did\ncatch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a\nhalf a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the\nbag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed\nit in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a\nnigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don\u2019t turn over the straw tick only\nabout twice a year, and so it warn\u2019t in no danger of getting stole now.\n \nBut I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way down\nstairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a\nchance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres,\nbecause if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed\nthat very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn\u2019t a gone\nto sleep if I\u2019d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the\nbusiness. By-and-by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my\npallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if\nanything was going to happen. But nothing did.\n \nSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn\u2019t begun\nyet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\n",
        "\nI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and\ngot down stairs all right. There warn\u2019t a sound anywheres. I peeped through a\ncrack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all\nsound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the\ncorpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and\nthe parlor door was open; but I see there warn\u2019t nobody in there but the\nremainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the\nkey wasn\u2019t there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back\nbehind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place\nI see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot,\nshowing the dead man\u2019s face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his\nshroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his\nhands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back\nacross the room and in behind the door.\n \nThe person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled\ndown and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to\ncry, though I couldn\u2019t hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I\npassed the dining-room I thought I\u2019d make sure them watchers hadn\u2019t seen me; so\nI looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn\u2019t stirred.\n \nI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out\nthat way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says\nI, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river\na hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up\nagain and get it; but that ain\u2019t the thing that\u2019s going to happen; the thing\nthat\u2019s going to happen is, the money \u2019ll be found when they come to screw on\nthe lid. Then the king \u2019ll get it again, and it \u2019ll be a long day before he\ngives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I wanted\nto slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn\u2019t try it. Every minute it was\ngetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir,\nand I might get catched\u2014catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that\nnobody hadn\u2019t hired me to take care of. I don\u2019t wish to be mixed up in no such\nbusiness as that, I says to myself.\n \nWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers\nwas gone. There warn\u2019t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and\nour tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I\ncouldn\u2019t tell.\n \nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set\nthe coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all\nour chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the\nparlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was\nbefore, but I dasn\u2019t go to look in under it, with folks around.\n \nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in\nthe front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people\nfiled around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man\u2019s face a\nminute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only\nthe girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their\nheads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn\u2019t no other sound but the scraping\nof the feet on the floor and blowing noses\u2014because people always blows them\nmore at a funeral than they do at other places except church.\n \nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black\ngloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting\npeople and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than\na cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he\nopened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he\ntook his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest,\nstealthiest man I ever see; and there warn\u2019t no more smile to him than there is\nto a ham.\n \nThey had borrowed a melodeum\u2014a sick one; and when everything was ready a young\nwoman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and\neverybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing,\naccording to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn,\nand begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the\ncellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful\nracket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over\nthe coffin, and wait\u2014you couldn\u2019t hear yourself think. It was right down\nawkward, and nobody didn\u2019t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see\nthat long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry\u2014just depend on me.\u201d Then he stooped down and begun to glide\nalong the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\u2019s heads. So he\nglided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all\nthe time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he\ndisappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog\nhe finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead\nstill, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or\ntwo here comes this undertaker\u2019s back and shoulders gliding along the wall\nagain; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then\nrose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out\ntowards the preacher, over the people\u2019s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse\nwhisper, \u201cHe had a rat!\u201d Then he drooped down and glided along the wall\nagain to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\nbecause naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don\u2019t cost\nnothing, and it\u2019s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to\nand liked. There warn\u2019t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker\nwas.\n \nWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then\nthe king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the\njob was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his\nscrew-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never\nmeddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down\ntight and fast. So there I was! I didn\u2019t know whether the money was in there or\nnot. So, says I, s\u2019pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?\u2014now how do\nI know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S\u2019pose she dug him up and\ndidn\u2019t find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get\nhunted up and jailed; I\u2019d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all;\nthe thing\u2019s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\u2019ve worsened it a hundred\ntimes, and I wish to goodness I\u2019d just let it alone, dad fetch the whole\nbusiness!\n \nThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again\u2014I\ncouldn\u2019t help it, and I couldn\u2019t rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces\ndidn\u2019t tell me nothing.\n \nThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made\nhimself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over\nin England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the\nestate right away and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and\nso was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could\nsee it couldn\u2019t be done. And he said of course him and William would take the\ngirls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls\nwould be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls,\ntoo\u2014tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and\ntold him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor\nthings was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled\nand lied to so, but I didn\u2019t see no safe way for me to chip in and change the\ngeneral tune.\n \nWell, blamed if the king didn\u2019t bill the house and the niggers and all the\nproperty for auction straight off\u2014sale two days after the funeral; but anybody\ncould buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\n \nSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls\u2019 joy got\nthe first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them\nthe niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they\nwent, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to\nOrleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts\nfor grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down\nsick to see it. The girls said they hadn\u2019t ever dreamed of seeing the family\nseparated or sold away from the town. I can\u2019t ever get it out of my memory, the\nsight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other\u2019s\nnecks and crying; and I reckon I couldn\u2019t a stood it all, but would a had to\nbust out and tell on our gang if I hadn\u2019t knowed the sale warn\u2019t no account and\nthe niggers would be back home in a week or two.\n \nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted\nand said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way. It\ninjured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all\nthe duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.\n \nNext day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and the duke\ncome up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was\ntrouble. The king says:\n \n\u201cWas you in my room night before last?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, your majesty\u201d\u2014which was the way I always called him when nobody but our\ngang warn\u2019t around.\n \n\u201cWas you in there yisterday er last night?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, your majesty.\u201d\n \n\u201cHonor bright, now\u2014no lies.\u201d\n \n\u201cHonor bright, your majesty, I\u2019m telling you the truth. I hain\u2019t been a-near\nyour room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.\u201d\n \nThe duke says:\n \n\u201cHave you seen anybody else go in there?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\u201d\n \n\u201cStop and think.\u201d\n \nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\n \n\u201cWell, I see the niggers go in there several times.\u201d\n \nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn\u2019t ever expected it,\nand then like they had. Then the duke says:\n \n\u201cWhat, all of them?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014leastways, not all at once\u2014that is, I don\u2019t think I ever see them all come\nout at once but just one time.\u201d\n \n\u201cHello! When was that?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn\u2019t early, because I\noverslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, go on, go on! What did they do? How\u2019d they act?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do nothing. And they didn\u2019t act anyway much, as fur as I see. They\ntiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they\u2019d shoved in there to do up your\nmajesty\u2019s room, or something, s\u2019posing you was up; and found you warn\u2019t\nup, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking\nyou up, if they hadn\u2019t already waked you up.\u201d\n \n\u201cGreat guns, this is a go!\u201d says the king; and both of them looked\npretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and scratching\ntheir heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy\nchuckle, and says:\n \n\u201cIt does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be\nsorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was\nsorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don\u2019t ever tell me any more\nthat a nigger ain\u2019t got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that\nthing it would fool anybody. In my opinion, there\u2019s a fortune in \u2019em. If\nI had capital and a theater, I wouldn\u2019t want a better lay-out than that\u2014and\nhere we\u2019ve gone and sold \u2019em for a song. Yes, and ain\u2019t privileged to sing the\nsong yet. Say, where is that song\u2014that draft?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right then, thank goodness.\u201d\n \nSays I, kind of timid-like:\n \n\u201cIs something gone wrong?\u201d\n \nThe king whirls on me and rips out:\n \n\u201cNone o\u2019 your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y\u2019r own affairs\u2014if\nyou got any. Long as you\u2019re in this town don\u2019t you forgit that\u2014you\nhear?\u201d Then he says to the duke, \u201cWe got to jest swaller it and say noth\u2019n\u2019:\nmum\u2019s the word for us.\u201d\n \nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:\n \n\u201cQuick sales and small profits! It\u2019s a good business\u2014yes.\u201d\n \nThe king snarls around on him and says:\n \n\u201cI was trying to do for the best in sellin\u2019 \u2019em out so quick. If the profits\nhas turned out to be none, lackin\u2019 considable, and none to carry, is it my\nfault any more\u2019n it\u2019s yourn?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they\u2019d be in this house yet and we wouldn\u2019t if I could a\ngot my advice listened to.\u201d\n \nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and\nlit into me again. He give me down the banks for not coming and\ntelling him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way\u2014said\nany fool would a knowed something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed\nhimself awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking\nhis natural rest that morning, and he\u2019d be blamed if he\u2019d ever do it again. So\nthey went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I\u2019d worked it all off on to\nthe niggers, and yet hadn\u2019t done the niggers no harm by it.\n",
        "\nBy-and-by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started for\ndown-stairs; but as I come to the girls\u2019 room the door was open, and I see Mary\nJane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she\u2019d been packing\nthings in it\u2014getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a\nfolded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad\nto see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says:\n \n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, you can\u2019t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I\ncan\u2019t\u2014most always. Tell me about it.\u201d\n \nSo she done it. And it was the niggers\u2014I just expected it. She said the\nbeautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn\u2019t know\nhow she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the\nchildren warn\u2019t ever going to see each other no more\u2014and then busted out\nbitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\n \n\u201cOh, dear, dear, to think they ain\u2019t ever going to see each other any\nmore!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut they will\u2014and inside of two weeks\u2014and I know it!\u201d says I.\n \nLaws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her\narms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again,\nsay it again!\n \nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I\nasked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and\nexcited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person\nthat\u2019s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself,\nI reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is\ntaking considerable many resks, though I ain\u2019t had no experience, and can\u2019t say\nfor certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here\u2019s a case where I\u2019m\nblest if it don\u2019t look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer\nthan a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other,\nit\u2019s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I\nsays to myself at last, I\u2019m a-going to chance it; I\u2019ll up and tell the truth\nthis time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and\ntouching it off just to see where you\u2019ll go to. Then I says:\n \n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could\ngo and stay three or four days?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; Mr. Lothrop\u2019s. Why?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind why yet. If I\u2019ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each\nother again inside of two weeks\u2014here in this house\u2014and prove how I know\nit\u2014will you go to Mr. Lothrop\u2019s and stay four days?\u201d\n \n\u201cFour days!\u201d she says; \u201cI\u2019ll stay a year!\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right,\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t want nothing more out of you than just\nyour word\u2014I druther have it than another man\u2019s kiss-the-Bible.\u201d She smiled and\nreddened up very sweet, and I says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind it, I\u2019ll shut the\ndoor\u2014and bolt it.\u201d\n \nThen I come back and set down again, and says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the\ntruth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it\u2019s a bad kind, and going\nto be hard to take, but there ain\u2019t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain\u2019t\nno uncles at all; they\u2019re a couple of frauds\u2014regular dead-beats. There, now\nwe\u2019re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.\u201d\n \nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water\nnow, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time,\nand told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool\ngoing up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the\nking\u2019s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen\ntimes\u2014and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:\n \n\u201cThe brute! Come, don\u2019t waste a minute\u2014not a second\u2014we\u2019ll have them\ntarred and feathered, and flung in the river!\u201d\n \nSays I:\n \n\u201cCert\u2019nly. But do you mean before you go to Mr. Lothrop\u2019s, or\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat am I thinking about!\u201d she says, and set right down\nagain. \u201cDon\u2019t mind what I said\u2014please don\u2019t\u2014you won\u2019t, now, will\nyou?\u201d Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would\ndie first. \u201cI never thought, I was so stirred up,\u201d she says; \u201cnow go on, and I\nwon\u2019t do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cit\u2019s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I\u2019m fixed so I got to\ntravel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not\u2014I druther not tell\nyou why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their\nclaws, and I\u2019d be all right; but there\u2019d be another person that you don\u2019t know\nabout who\u2019d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him, hain\u2019t we? Of\ncourse. Well, then, we won\u2019t blow on them.\u201d\n \nSaying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me\nand Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn\u2019t\nwant to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions\nbut me; so I didn\u2019t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I\nsays:\n \n\u201cMiss Mary Jane, I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do, and you won\u2019t have to stay at Mr.\nLothrop\u2019s so long, nuther. How fur is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cA little short of four miles\u2014right out in the country, back here.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or\nhalf-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again\u2014tell them you\u2019ve\nthought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this\nwindow, and if I don\u2019t turn up wait till eleven, and then if I\ndon\u2019t turn up it means I\u2019m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come\nout and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd if it just happens so that I don\u2019t get away, but get took up along with\nthem, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must\nstand by me all you can.\u201d\n \n\u201cStand by you! indeed I will. They sha\u2019n\u2019t touch a hair of your head!\u201d she\nsays, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.\n \n\u201cIf I get away I sha\u2019n\u2019t be here,\u201d I says, \u201cto prove these rapscallions ain\u2019t\nyour uncles, and I couldn\u2019t do it if I was here. I could swear they was\nbeats and bummers, that\u2019s all, though that\u2019s worth something. Well, there\u2019s\nothers can do that better than what I can, and they\u2019re people that ain\u2019t going\nto be doubted as quick as I\u2019d be. I\u2019ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a\npencil and a piece of paper. There\u2014\u2018Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.\u2019 Put it\naway, and don\u2019t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these\ntwo, let them send up to Bricksville and say they\u2019ve got the men that played\nthe Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses\u2014why, you\u2019ll have that entire\ntown down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they\u2019ll come\na-biling, too.\u201d\n \nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\n \n\u201cJust let the auction go right along, and don\u2019t worry. Nobody don\u2019t have to pay\nfor the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the\nshort notice, and they ain\u2019t going out of this till they get that money; and\nthe way we\u2019ve fixed it the sale ain\u2019t going to count, and they ain\u2019t going to\nget no money. It\u2019s just like the way it was with the niggers\u2014it warn\u2019t\nno sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can\u2019t collect the\nmoney for the niggers yet\u2014they\u2019re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss\nMary.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll run down to breakfast now, and then I\u2019ll start straight\nfor Mr. Lothrop\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2019Deed, that ain\u2019t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,\u201d I says, \u201cby no manner of\nmeans; go before breakfast.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I never thought\u2014and come to think, I don\u2019t know. What was it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s because you ain\u2019t one of these leather-face people. I don\u2019t want no\nbetter book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like\ncoarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to\nkiss you good-morning, and never\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThere, there, don\u2019t! Yes, I\u2019ll go before breakfast\u2014I\u2019ll be glad to. And leave\nmy sisters with them?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; never mind about them. They\u2019ve got to stand it yet a while. They might\nsuspicion something if all of you was to go. I don\u2019t want you to see them, nor\nyour sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your\nuncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along,\nMiss Mary Jane, and I\u2019ll fix it with all of them. I\u2019ll tell Miss Susan to give\nyour love to your uncles and say you\u2019ve went away for a few hours for to get a\nlittle rest and change, or to see a friend, and you\u2019ll be back to-night or\nearly in the morning.\u201d\n \n\u201cGone to see a friend is all right, but I won\u2019t have my love given to them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, it sha\u2019n\u2019t be.\u201d It was well enough to tell her so\u2014no harm\nin it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it\u2019s the little\nthings that smooths people\u2019s roads the most, down here below; it would make\nMary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn\u2019t cost nothing. Then I says: \u201cThere\u2019s one\nmore thing\u2014that bag of money.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they\u2019ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how\nthey got it.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you\u2019re out, there. They hain\u2019t got it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, who\u2019s got it?\u201d\n \n\u201cI wish I knowed, but I don\u2019t. I had it, because I stole it from them;\nand I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I\u2019m afraid it\nain\u2019t there no more. I\u2019m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I\u2019m just as sorry as I\ncan be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught,\nand I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run\u2014and it warn\u2019t a\ngood place.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, stop blaming yourself\u2014it\u2019s too bad to do it, and I won\u2019t allow it\u2014you\ncouldn\u2019t help it; it wasn\u2019t your fault. Where did you hide it?\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn\u2019t\nseem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in\nthe coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn\u2019t say\nnothing; then I says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don\u2019t\nmind letting me off; but I\u2019ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can\nread it along the road to Mr. Lothrop\u2019s, if you want to. Do you reckon that\u2019ll\ndo?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\n \nSo I wrote: \u201cI put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there,\naway in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss\nMary Jane.\u201d\n \nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in\nthe night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her\nand robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water\ncome into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:\n \n\u201cGood-bye. I\u2019m going to do everything just as you\u2019ve told me; and if I\ndon\u2019t ever see you again, I sha\u2019n\u2019t ever forget you and I\u2019ll think of you a\nmany and a many a time, and I\u2019ll pray for you, too!\u201d\u2014and she was gone.\n \nPray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she\u2019d take a job that was more nearer\nher size. But I bet she done it, just the same\u2014she was just that kind. She had\nthe grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion\u2014there warn\u2019t no back-down to\nher, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand\nin her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It\nsounds like flattery, but it ain\u2019t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty\u2014and\ngoodness, too\u2014she lays over them all. I hain\u2019t ever seen her since that time\nthat I see her go out of that door; no, I hain\u2019t ever seen her since, but I\nreckon I\u2019ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying\nshe would pray for me; and if ever I\u2019d a thought it would do any good for me to\npray for her, blamed if I wouldn\u2019t a done it or bust.\n \nWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go.\nWhen I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of them people over on t\u2019other side of the river that you all\ngoes to see sometimes?\u201d\n \nThey says:\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s several; but it\u2019s the Proctors, mainly.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s the name,\u201d I says; \u201cI most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me\nto tell you she\u2019s gone over there in a dreadful hurry\u2014one of them\u2019s sick.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cSakes alive, I hope it ain\u2019t Hanner?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it,\u201d I says, \u201cbut Hanner\u2019s the very one.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said,\nand they don\u2019t think she\u2019ll last many hours.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly think of that, now! What\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d\n \nI couldn\u2019t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:\n \n\u201cMumps.\u201d\n \n\u201cMumps your granny! They don\u2019t set up with people that\u2019s got the mumps.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t, don\u2019t they? You better bet they do with these mumps. These\nmumps is different. It\u2019s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow\u2019s it a new kind?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause it\u2019s mixed up with other things.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat other things?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller\njanders, and brain-fever, and I don\u2019t know what all.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy land! And they call it the mumps?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what Miss Mary Jane said.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, because it is the mumps. That\u2019s what it starts with.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison,\nand fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and\nsomebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say,\n\u2018Why, he stumped his toe.\u2019 Would ther\u2019 be any sense in that? No.\nAnd ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no sense in this, nuther. Is it ketching?\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it ketching? Why, how you talk. Is a harrow catching\u2014in the\ndark? If you don\u2019t hitch on to one tooth, you\u2019re bound to on another, ain\u2019t\nyou? And you can\u2019t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow\nalong, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may\nsay\u2014and it ain\u2019t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on\ngood.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s awful, I think,\u201d says the hare-lip. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Uncle Harvey and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I says, \u201cI would. Of course I would. I wouldn\u2019t lose\nno time.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n \n\u201cJust look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain\u2019t your uncles obleegd to\nget along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they\u2019d be mean\nenough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You\nknow they\u2019ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey\u2019s a preacher,\nain\u2019t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat\nclerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk?\u2014so as to get them to let\nMiss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain\u2019t. What will he do,\nthen? Why, he\u2019ll say, \u2018It\u2019s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get\nalong the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful\npluribus-unum mumps, and so it\u2019s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the\nthree months it takes to show on her if she\u2019s got it.\u2019 But never mind, if you\nthink it\u2019s best to tell your uncle Harvey\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in\nEngland whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane\u2019s got it or not?\nWhy, you talk like a muggins.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, anyway, maybe you\u2019d better tell some of the neighbors.\u201d\n \n\u201cListen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can\u2019t you\nsee that they\u2019d go and tell? Ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no way but just to not\ntell anybody at all.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019re right\u2014yes, I judge you are right.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she\u2019s gone out a while, anyway, so\nhe won\u2019t be uneasy about her?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, \u2018Tell them to give\nUncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I\u2019ve run over the river to\nsee Mr.\u2019\u2014Mr.\u2014what is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used\nto think so much of?\u2014I mean the one that\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, you must mean the Apthorps, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course; bother them kind of names, a body can\u2019t ever seem to remember them,\nhalf the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the\nApthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she\nallowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she\u2019s\ngoing to stick to them till they say they\u2019ll come, and then, if she ain\u2019t too\ntired, she\u2019s coming home; and if she is, she\u2019ll be home in the morning anyway.\nShe said, don\u2019t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the\nApthorps\u2014which\u2019ll be perfectly true, because she is going there to\nspeak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right,\u201d they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them\nthe love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\n \nEverything was all right now. The girls wouldn\u2019t say nothing because they\nwanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was\noff working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt\nvery good; I judged I had done it pretty neat\u2014I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn\u2019t a\ndone it no neater himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but\nI can\u2019t do that very handy, not being brung up to it.\n \nWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the\nafternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on\nhand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and\nchipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of\nsome kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed\nhow, and just spreading himself generly.\n \nBut by-and-by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold\u2014everything but\na little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they\u2019d got to work that\noff\u2014I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow\neverything. Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about\ntwo minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying\non, and singing out:\n \n\u201cHere\u2019s your opposition line! here\u2019s your two sets o\u2019 heirs to old Peter\nWilks\u2014and you pays your money and you takes your choice!\u201d\n",
        "\nThey was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking\nyounger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls, how the people\nyelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn\u2019t see no joke about it, and I\njudged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they\u2019d\nturn pale. But no, nary a pale did they turn. The duke he never let on\nhe suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and\nsatisfied, like a jug that\u2019s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he\njust gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the\nstomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals\nin the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered\naround the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that\nhad just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I\nsee straight off he pronounced like an Englishman\u2014not the king\u2019s way,\nthough the king\u2019s was pretty good for an imitation. I can\u2019t give the old\ngent\u2019s words, nor I can\u2019t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and\nsays, about like this:\n \n\u201cThis is a surprise to me which I wasn\u2019t looking for; and I\u2019ll acknowledge,\ncandid and frank, I ain\u2019t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my\nbrother and me has had misfortunes; he\u2019s broke his arm, and our baggage got put\noff at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter\nWilks\u2019 brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can\u2019t hear nor\nspeak\u2014and can\u2019t even make signs to amount to much, now\u2019t he\u2019s only got one hand\nto work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get\nthe baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won\u2019t say nothing more, but go\nto the hotel and wait.\u201d\n \nSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:\n \n\u201cBroke his arm\u2014very likely, ain\u2019t it?\u2014and very convenient, too,\nfor a fraud that\u2019s got to make signs, and ain\u2019t learnt how. Lost their baggage!\nThat\u2019s mighty good!\u2014and mighty ingenious\u2014under the\ncircumstances!\u201d\n \nSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe\nhalf a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking\ngentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of\ncarpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in\na low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their\nheads\u2014it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another\none was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman\nsaid, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky\nup and says:\n \n\u201cSay, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\u2019d you come to this town?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe day before the funeral, friend,\u201d says the king.\n \n\u201cBut what time o\u2019 day?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the evenin\u2019\u2014\u2019bout an hour er two before sundown.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow\u2019d you come?\u201d\n \n\u201cI come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, how\u2019d you come to be up at the Pint in the mornin\u2019\u2014in a\ncanoe?\u201d\n \n\u201cI warn\u2019t up at the Pint in the mornin\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n \nSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old\nman and a preacher.\n \n\u201cPreacher be hanged, he\u2019s a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that\nmornin\u2019. I live up there, don\u2019t I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I\nsee him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.\u201d\n \nThe doctor he up and says:\n \n\u201cWould you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon I would, but I don\u2019t know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him\nperfectly easy.\u201d\n \nIt was me he pointed at. The doctor says:\n \n\u201cNeighbors, I don\u2019t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\nthese two ain\u2019t frauds, I am an idiot, that\u2019s all. I think it\u2019s our duty\nto see that they don\u2019t get away from here till we\u2019ve looked into this thing.\nCome along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We\u2019ll take these fellows to the\ntavern and affront them with t\u2019other couple, and I reckon we\u2019ll find out\nsomething before we get through.\u201d\n \nIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\u2019s friends; so we all\nstarted. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was\nplenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\n \nWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in\nthe new couple. First, the doctor says:\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they\u2019re\nfrauds, and they may have complices that we don\u2019t know nothing about. If they\nhave, won\u2019t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It\nain\u2019t unlikely. If these men ain\u2019t frauds, they won\u2019t object to sending for\nthat money and letting us keep it till they prove they\u2019re all right\u2014ain\u2019t that\nso?\u201d\n \nEverybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place\nright at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says:\n \n\u201cGentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\u2019t got no disposition to throw\nanything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o\u2019 this misable\nbusiness; but, alas, the money ain\u2019t there; you k\u2019n send and see, if you want\nto.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o\u2019\nthe straw tick o\u2019 my bed, not wishin\u2019 to bank it for the few days we\u2019d be here,\nand considerin\u2019 the bed a safe place, we not bein\u2019 used to niggers, and\nsuppos\u2019n\u2019 \u2019em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very\nnext mornin\u2019 after I had went down stairs; and when I sold \u2019em I hadn\u2019t missed\nthe money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k\u2019n tell you\n\u2019bout it, gentlemen.\u201d\n \nThe doctor and several said \u201cShucks!\u201d and I see nobody didn\u2019t altogether\nbelieve him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I\nsee them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought\nnothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was\ntrying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked\nme. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:\n \n\u201cAre you English, too?\u201d\n \nI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \u201cStuff!\u201d\n \nWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up\nand down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor\never seemed to think about it\u2014and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it\nwas the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his\nyarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his\u2019n; and anybody but a lot of\nprejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning\ntruth and t\u2019other one lies. And by-and-by they had me up to tell what I knowed.\nThe king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I\nknowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and\nhow we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn\u2019t\nget pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n \n\u201cSet down, my boy; I wouldn\u2019t strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain\u2019t\nused to lying, it don\u2019t seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do\nit pretty awkward.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.\n \nThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\n \n\u201cIf you\u2019d been in town at first, Levi Bell\u2014\u201d The king broke in and reached out\nhis hand, and says:\n \n\u201cWhy, is this my poor dead brother\u2019s old friend that he\u2019s wrote so often\nabout?\u201d\n \nThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and\nthey talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at\nlast the lawyer speaks up and says:\n \n\u201cThat\u2019ll fix it. I\u2019ll take the order and send it, along with your brother\u2019s,\nand then they\u2019ll know it\u2019s all right.\u201d\n \nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head\nto one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they\ngive the pen to the duke\u2014and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But\nhe took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman\nand says:\n \n\u201cYou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\u201d\n \nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\u2019t read it. The lawyer looked\npowerful astonished, and says:\n \n\u201cWell, it beats me\u201d\u2014and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\nand examined them, and then examined the old man\u2019s writing, and then\nthem again; and then says: \u201cThese old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and\nhere\u2019s these two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn\u2019t\nwrite them\u201d (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see\nhow the lawyer had took them in), \u201cand here\u2019s this old gentleman\u2019s hand\nwriting, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he didn\u2019t write them\u2014fact\nis, the scratches he makes ain\u2019t properly writing at all. Now, here\u2019s\nsome letters from\u2014\u201d\n \nThe new old gentleman says:\n \n\u201cIf you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there\u2014so\nhe copies for me. It\u2019s his hand you\u2019ve got there, not mine.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell!\u201d says the lawyer, \u201cthis is a state of things. I\u2019ve got\nsome of William\u2019s letters, too; so if you\u2019ll get him to write a line or so we\ncan com\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHe can\u2019t write with his left hand,\u201d says the old gentleman. \u201cIf he\ncould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine\ntoo. Look at both, please\u2014they\u2019re by the same hand.\u201d\n \nThe lawyer done it, and says:\n \n\u201cI believe it\u2019s so\u2014and if it ain\u2019t so, there\u2019s a heap stronger resemblance than\nI\u2019d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the\ntrack of a solution, but it\u2019s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one\nthing is proved\u2014these two ain\u2019t either of \u2019em Wilkses\u201d\u2014and he wagged his\nhead towards the king and the duke.\n \nWell, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn\u2019t give in then!\nIndeed he wouldn\u2019t. Said it warn\u2019t no fair test. Said his brother William was\nthe cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\u2019t tried to write\u2014he\nsee William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to\npaper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he\nwas actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself; but pretty\nsoon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my\nbr\u2014helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d says somebody, \u201cme and Ab Turner done it. We\u2019re both here.\u201d\n \nThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n \n\u201cPerhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\u201d\n \nBlamed if the king didn\u2019t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\u2019d a squshed down\nlike a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and,\nmind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush\nto get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was\nhe going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he\ncouldn\u2019t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a\nlittle forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, Now he\u2019ll throw up\nthe sponge\u2014there ain\u2019t no more use. Well, did he? A body can\u2019t hardly believe\nit, but he didn\u2019t. I reckon he thought he\u2019d keep the thing up till he tired\nthem people out, so they\u2019d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and\nget away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n \n\u201cMf! It\u2019s a very tough question, ain\u2019t it! Yes, sir, I k\u2019n\ntell you what\u2019s tattooed on his breast. It\u2019s jest a small, thin, blue\narrow\u2014that\u2019s what it is; and if you don\u2019t look clost, you can\u2019t see it.\nNow what do you say\u2014hey?\u201d\n \nWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\ncheek.\n \nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye\nlights up like he judged he\u2019d got the king this time, and says:\n \n\u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks\u2019\nbreast?\u201d\n \nBoth of them spoke up and says:\n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see no such mark.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d says the old gentleman. \u201cNow, what you did see on his breast was\na small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and\na W, with dashes between them, so: P\u2014B\u2014W\u201d\u2014and he marked them that way on a\npiece of paper. \u201cCome, ain\u2019t that what you saw?\u201d\n \nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:\n \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t. We never seen any marks at all.\u201d\n \nWell, everybody was in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n \n\u201cThe whole bilin\u2019 of \u2019m \u2019s frauds! Le\u2019s duck \u2019em! le\u2019s drown \u2019em! le\u2019s\nride \u2019em on a rail!\u201d and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a\nrattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says:\n \n\u201cGentlemen\u2014gentlemen! Hear me just a word\u2014just a single word\u2014if\nyou PLEASE! There\u2019s one way yet\u2014let\u2019s go and dig up the corpse\nand look.\u201d\n \nThat took them.\n \n\u201cHooray!\u201d they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the\ndoctor sung out:\n \n\u201cHold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch them\nalong, too!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it!\u201d they all shouted; \u201cand if we don\u2019t find them marks we\u2019ll lynch\nthe whole gang!\u201d\n \nI was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn\u2019t no getting away, you\nknow. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\ngraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at\nour heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.\n \nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn\u2019t sent Mary Jane out of town; because\nnow if I could tip her the wink she\u2019d light out and save me, and blow on our\ndead-beats.\n \nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and\nto make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to\nwink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most\nawful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned;\neverything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being\nfixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have\nMary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here\nwas nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them\ntattoo-marks. If they didn\u2019t find them\u2014\n \nI couldn\u2019t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\u2019t think about\nnothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the\ncrowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist\u2014Hines\u2014and a body might\nas well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so\nexcited, and I had to run to keep up.\n \nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an\noverflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred\ntimes as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn\u2019t thought to fetch a\nlantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning,\nand sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.\n \nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\nstarted, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker\nand brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of\nit, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything\nand every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of\nthe grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn\u2019t see\nnothing at all.\n \nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such\nanother crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and\nget a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he\nhurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I\nwas in the world, he was so excited and panting.\n \nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and\nsomebody sings out:\n \n\u201cBy the living jingo, here\u2019s the bag of gold on his breast!\u201d\n \nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big\nsurge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for\nthe road in the dark there ain\u2019t nobody can tell.\n \nI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew\u2014leastways, I had it all to\nmyself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of\nthe rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and\nsure as you are born I did clip it along!\n \nWhen I struck the town I see there warn\u2019t nobody out in the storm, so I never\nhunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and\nwhen I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light\nthere; the house all dark\u2014which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn\u2019t\nknow why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light\nin Mary Jane\u2019s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the\nsame second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn\u2019t ever going\nto be before me no more in this world. She was the best girl I ever see,\nand had the most sand.\n \nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the tow-head, I\nbegun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning\nshowed me one that wasn\u2019t chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and\nwarn\u2019t fastened with nothing but a rope. The tow-head was a rattling big\ndistance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn\u2019t lose no\ntime; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid\ndown to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn\u2019t. As I sprung aboard\nI sung out:\n \n\u201cOut with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we\u2019re shut of\nthem!\u201d\n \nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of\njoy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and\nI went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded\nA-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim\nfished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad\nI was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:\n \n\u201cNot now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her\nslide!\u201d\n \nSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it did seem\nso good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to\nbother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few\ntimes\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I\nknowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure\nenough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come!\u2014and just\na-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the\nduke.\n \nSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all I\ncould do to keep from crying.\n",
        "\nWhen they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and\nsays:\n \n\u201cTryin\u2019 to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company, hey?\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cNo, your majesty, we warn\u2019t\u2014please don\u2019t, your majesty!\u201d\n \n\u201cQuick, then, and tell us what was your idea, or I\u2019ll shake the insides\nout o\u2019 you!\u201d\n \n\u201cHonest, I\u2019ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty. The man\nthat had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about\nas big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a\ndangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and\nmade a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, \u2018Heel it now, or\nthey\u2019ll hang ye, sure!\u2019 and I lit out. It didn\u2019t seem no good for me to\nstay\u2014I couldn\u2019t do nothing, and I didn\u2019t want to be hung if I could get\naway. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I\ntold Jim to hurry, or they\u2019d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard\nyou and the duke wasn\u2019t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and\nwas awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \nJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s\nmighty likely!\u201d and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he\u2019d drownd\nme. But the duke says:\n \n\u201cLeggo the boy, you old idiot! Would you a done any different? Did you\ninquire around for him when you got loose? I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n \nSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But\nthe duke says:\n \n\u201cYou better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing, for you\u2019re the\none that\u2019s entitled to it most. You hain\u2019t done a thing from the start that had\nany sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary\nblue-arrow mark. That was bright\u2014it was right down bully; and it was the\nthing that saved us. For if it hadn\u2019t been for that, they\u2019d a jailed us till\nthem Englishmen\u2019s baggage come\u2014and then\u2014the penitentiary, you bet! But that\ntrick took \u2019em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness;\nfor if the excited fools hadn\u2019t let go all holts and made that rush to get a\nlook, we\u2019d a slept in our cravats to-night\u2014cravats warranted to wear,\ntoo\u2014longer than we\u2019d need \u2019em.\u201d\n \nThey was still a minute\u2014thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded\nlike:\n \n\u201cMf! And we reckoned the niggers stole it!\u201d\n \nThat made me squirm!\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \u201cWe\ndid.\u201d\n \nAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:\n \n\u201cLeastways, I did.\u201d\n \nThe duke says, the same way:\n \n\u201cOn the contrary, I did.\u201d\n \nThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:\n \n\u201cLooky here, Bilgewater, what\u2019r you referrin\u2019 to?\u201d\n \nThe duke says, pretty brisk:\n \n\u201cWhen it comes to that, maybe you\u2019ll let me ask, what was you referring\nto?\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks!\u201d says the king, very sarcastic; \u201cbut I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe you was\nasleep, and didn\u2019t know what you was about.\u201d\n \nThe duke bristles up now, and says:\n \n\u201cOh, let up on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame\u2019 fool?\nDon\u2019t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir! I know you do know, because you done it yourself!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d\u2014and the duke went for him. The king sings out:\n \n\u201cTake y\u2019r hands off!\u2014leggo my throat!\u2014I take it all back!\u201d\n \nThe duke says:\n \n\u201cWell, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money there,\nintending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up,\nand have it all to yourself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWait jest a minute, duke\u2014answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you\ndidn\u2019t put the money there, say it, and I\u2019ll b\u2019lieve you, and take back\neverything I said.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou old scoundrel, I didn\u2019t, and you know I didn\u2019t. There, now!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, I b\u2019lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more\u2014now\ndon\u2019t git mad; didn\u2019t you have it in your mind to hook the money and\nhide it?\u201d\n \nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\n \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care if I did, I didn\u2019t do it, anyway. But you not\nonly had it in mind to do it, but you done it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that\u2019s honest. I won\u2019t say I\nwarn\u2019t goin\u2019 to do it, because I was; but you\u2014I mean somebody\u2014got in\nahead o\u2019 me.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie! You done it, and you got to say you done it, or\u2014\u201d\n \nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\n \n\u201c\u2019Nough!\u2014I own up!\u201d\n \nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than\nwhat I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:\n \n\u201cIf you ever deny it again I\u2019ll drown you. It\u2019s well for you to set\nthere and blubber like a baby\u2014it\u2019s fitten for you, after the way you\u2019ve acted.\nI never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything\u2014and I\na-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been\nashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor\nniggers, and you never say a word for \u2019em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think\nI was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why\nyou was so anxious to make up the deffisit\u2014you wanted to get what money I\u2019d got\nout of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all!\u201d\n \nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n \n\u201cWhy, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn\u2019t me.\u201d\n \n\u201cDry up! I don\u2019t want to hear no more out of you!\u201d says the duke. \u201cAnd\nnow you see what you got by it. They\u2019ve got all their own money\nback, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides. G\u2019long to bed,\nand don\u2019t you deffersit me no more deffersits, long \u2019s you live!\u201d\n \nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and\nbefore long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour\nthey was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they\ngot, and went off a-snoring in each other\u2019s arms. They both got powerful\nmellow, but I noticed the king didn\u2019t get mellow enough to forget to remember\nto not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and\nsatisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told\nJim everything.\n",
        "\nWe dasn\u2019t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the\nriver. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from\nhome. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from\nthe limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and\nit made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was\nout of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.\n \nFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\u2019t make enough for them\nboth to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school;\nbut they didn\u2019t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first\nprance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.\nAnother time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn\u2019t yellocute long\ntill the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip\nout. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling\nfortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn\u2019t seem to have no luck.\nSo at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she\nfloated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a\nday at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\n \nAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the\nwigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me\ngot uneasy. We didn\u2019t like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some\nkind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we\nmade up our minds they was going to break into somebody\u2019s house or store, or\nwas going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was\npretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn\u2019t have nothing in the\nworld to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give\nthem the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one\nmorning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit\nof a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us\nall to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody\nhad got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (\u201cHouse to rob, you\nmean,\u201d says I to myself; \u201cand when you get through robbing it you\u2019ll\ncome back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft\u2014and you\u2019ll\nhave to take it out in wondering.\u201d) And he said if he warn\u2019t back by midday the\nduke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.\n \nSo we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a\nmighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn\u2019t seem to do\nnothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing,\nsure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change,\nanyway\u2014and maybe a chance for the change on top of it. So me and the\nduke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and\nby-and-by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight,\nand a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and\na-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn\u2019t walk, and couldn\u2019t\ndo nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the\nking begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and\nshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer,\nfor I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before\nthey ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded\nup with joy, and sung out:\n \n\u201cSet her loose, Jim! we\u2019re all right now!\u201d\n \nBut there warn\u2019t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I\nset up a shout\u2014and then another\u2014and then another one; and run this way and that\nin the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn\u2019t no use\u2014old Jim was gone.\nThen I set down and cried; I couldn\u2019t help it. But I couldn\u2019t set still long.\nPretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run\nacross a boy walking, and asked him if he\u2019d seen a strange nigger dressed so\nand so, and he says:\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhereabouts?\u201d says I.\n \n\u201cDown to Silas Phelps\u2019 place, two mile below here. He\u2019s a runaway nigger, and\nthey\u2019ve got him. Was you looking for him?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou bet I ain\u2019t! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and\nhe said if I hollered he\u2019d cut my livers out\u2014and told me to lay down and stay\nwhere I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou needn\u2019t be afeard no more, becuz they\u2019ve got him. He run\noff f\u2019m down South, som\u2019ers.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good job they got him.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I reckon! There\u2019s two hunderd dollars reward on him. It\u2019s like\npicking up money out\u2019n the road.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, it is\u2014and I could a had it if I\u2019d been big enough; I see him\nfirst. Who nailed him?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was an old fellow\u2014a stranger\u2014and he sold out his chance in him for forty\ndollars, becuz he\u2019s got to go up the river and can\u2019t wait. Think o\u2019 that, now!\nYou bet I\u2019d wait, if it was seven year.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s me, every time,\u201d says I. \u201cBut maybe his chance ain\u2019t worth no more than\nthat, if he\u2019ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there\u2019s something ain\u2019t straight about\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut it is, though\u2014straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It\ntells all about him, to a dot\u2014paints him like a picture, and tells the\nplantation he\u2019s frum, below Newrleans. No-sirree-bob, they ain\u2019t\nno trouble \u2019bout that speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw\ntobacker, won\u2019t ye?\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam\nto think. But I couldn\u2019t come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore,\nbut I couldn\u2019t see no way out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and\nafter all we\u2019d done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing,\neverything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve\nJim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst\nstrangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.\n \nOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave\nat home where his family was, as long as he\u2019d got to be a slave, and so\nI\u2019d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where\nhe was. But I soon give up that notion for two things: she\u2019d be mad and\ndisgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she\u2019d\nsell him straight down the river again; and if she didn\u2019t, everybody naturally\ndespises an ungrateful nigger, and they\u2019d make Jim feel it all the time, and so\nhe\u2019d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me! It would get all\naround that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to\nsee anybody from that town again I\u2019d be ready to get down and lick his boots\nfor shame. That\u2019s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he\ndon\u2019t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it\nain\u2019t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this, the\nmore my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and\nornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here\nwas the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my\nwickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was\nstealing a poor old woman\u2019s nigger that hadn\u2019t ever done me no harm, and now\nwas showing me there\u2019s One that\u2019s always on the lookout, and ain\u2019t a-going to\nallow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most\ndropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder\nsoften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I\nwarn\u2019t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, \u201cThere was the\nSunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you\u2019d a done it they\u2019d a learnt\nyou there that people that acts as I\u2019d been acting about that nigger goes to\neverlasting fire.\u201d\n \nIt made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn\u2019t\ntry to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But\nthe words wouldn\u2019t come. Why wouldn\u2019t they? It warn\u2019t no use to try and hide it\nfrom Him. Nor from me, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn\u2019t\ncome. It was because my heart warn\u2019t right; it was because I warn\u2019t square; it\nwas because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but\naway inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to\nmake my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go\nand write to that nigger\u2019s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\nknowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can\u2019t pray a lie\u2014I found that out.\n \nSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\u2019t know what to do. At\nlast I had an idea; and I says, I\u2019ll go and write the letter\u2014and then\nsee if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a\nfeather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper\nand a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:\n \nMiss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville,\nand Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.\n \nHUCK FINN.\n \nI felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so\nin my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn\u2019t do it straight off, but\nlaid the paper down and set there thinking\u2014thinking how good it was all this\nhappened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on\nthinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim\nbefore me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight,\nsometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.\nBut somehow I couldn\u2019t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but\nonly the other kind. I\u2019d see him standing my watch on top of his\u2019n, \u2019stead of\ncalling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come\nback out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where\nthe feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me\nand do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at\nlast I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard,\nand he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the\nworld, and the only one he\u2019s got now; and then I happened to look around\nand see that paper.\n \nIt was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling,\nbecause I\u2019d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I\nstudied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\n \n\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll go to hell\u201d\u2014and tore it up.\n \nIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay\nsaid; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out\nof my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line,\nbeing brung up to it, and the other warn\u2019t. And for a starter I would go to\nwork and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything\nworse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I\nmight as well go the whole hog.\n \nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable\nmany ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I\ntook the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as\nsoon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it\nthere, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was\nlight, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some\nothers and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for\nshore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps\u2019s place, and hid my bundle in\nthe woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her\nand sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of\na mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n \nThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,\n\u201cPhelps\u2019s Sawmill,\u201d and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred\nyards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\u2019t see nobody around,\nthough it was good daylight now. But I didn\u2019t mind, because I didn\u2019t want to\nsee nobody just yet\u2014I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my\nplan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just\ntook a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I\nsee when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal\nNonesuch\u2014three-night performance\u2014like that other time. They had the\ncheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked\nastonished, and says:\n \n\u201cHel-lo! Where\u2019d you come from?\u201d Then he says, kind of glad and\neager, \u201cWhere\u2019s the raft?\u2014got her in a good place?\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what I was going to ask your grace.\u201d\n \nThen he didn\u2019t look so joyful, and says:\n \n\u201cWhat was your idea for asking me?\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cwhen I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to\nmyself, we can\u2019t get him home for hours, till he\u2019s soberer; so I went a-loafing\naround town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to\nhelp him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went\nalong; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of\nthe rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and\njerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn\u2019t have no dog, and so we had to\nchase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till\ndark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got\nthere and see it was gone, I says to myself, \u2018they\u2019ve got into trouble and had\nto leave; and they\u2019ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I\u2019ve got in the\nworld, and now I\u2019m in a strange country, and ain\u2019t got no property no more, nor\nnothing, and no way to make my living;\u2019 so I set down and cried. I slept in the\nwoods all night. But what did become of the raft, then?\u2014and Jim\u2014poor\nJim!\u201d\n \n\u201cBlamed if I know\u2014that is, what\u2019s become of the raft. That old fool had\nmade a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the\nloafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he\u2019d\nspent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft\ngone, we said, \u2018That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off\ndown the river.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t shake my nigger, would I?\u2014the only nigger I had in the\nworld, and the only property.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we\u2019d come to consider him\nour nigger; yes, we did consider him so\u2014goodness knows we had trouble\nenough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there\nwarn\u2019t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I\u2019ve\npegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where\u2019s that ten cents? Give it\nhere.\u201d\n \nI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it\nfor something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and\nI hadn\u2019t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said nothing. The next\nminute he whirls on me and says:\n \n\u201cDo you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We\u2019d skin him if he done that!\u201d\n \n\u201cHow can he blow? Hain\u2019t he run off?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money\u2019s gone.\u201d\n \n\u201cSold him?\u201d I says, and begun to cry; \u201cwhy, he was my nigger, and\nthat was my money. Where is he?\u2014I want my nigger.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t get your nigger, that\u2019s all\u2014so dry up your blubbering.\nLooky here\u2014do you think you\u2019d venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think\nI\u2019d trust you. Why, if you was to blow on us\u2014\u201d\n \nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I\nwent on a-whimpering, and says:\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\u2019t got no time to blow, nohow. I got\nto turn out and find my nigger.\u201d\n \nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his\narm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you\u2019ll promise you\nwon\u2019t blow, and won\u2019t let the nigger blow, I\u2019ll tell you where to find him.\u201d\n \nSo I promised, and he says:\n \n\u201cA farmer by the name of Silas Ph\u2014\u201d and then he stopped. You see, he started to\ntell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think\nagain, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn\u2019t trust\nme; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So\npretty soon he says:\n \n\u201cThe man that bought him is named Abram Foster\u2014Abram G. Foster\u2014and he lives\nforty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right,\u201d I says, \u201cI can walk it in three days. And I\u2019ll start this very\nafternoon.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo you wont, you\u2019ll start now; and don\u2019t you lose any time about it,\nneither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head\nand move right along, and then you won\u2019t get into trouble with us, d\u2019ye\nhear?\u201d\n \nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be\nleft free to work my plans.\n \n\u201cSo clear out,\u201d he says; \u201cand you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to.\nMaybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your nigger\u2014some idiots\ndon\u2019t require documents\u2014leastways I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s such down South here. And\nwhen you tell him the handbill and the reward\u2019s bogus, maybe he\u2019ll believe you\nwhen you explain to him what the idea was for getting \u2019em out. Go \u2019long now,\nand tell him anything you want to; but mind you don\u2019t work your jaw any\nbetween here and there.\u201d\n \nSo I left, and struck for the back country. I didn\u2019t look around, but I kinder\nfelt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I went\nstraight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled\nback through the woods towards Phelps\u2019. I reckoned I better start in on my plan\nstraight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim\u2019s mouth till\nthese fellows could get away. I didn\u2019t want no trouble with their kind. I\u2019d\nseen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.\n",
        "\nWhen I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the\nhands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs\nand flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody\u2019s dead\nand gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel\nmournful, because you feel like it\u2019s spirits whispering\u2014spirits that\u2019s been\ndead ever so many years\u2014and you always think they\u2019re talking about you.\nAs a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with\nit all.\n \nPhelps\u2019 was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look\nalike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off\nand up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the\nfence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a\nhorse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and\nsmooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the\nwhite folks\u2014hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and\nthese mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen,\nwith a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log\nsmoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row\nt\u2019other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against\nthe back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper\nand big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,\nwith bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds\nasleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant\nbushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a\ngarden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the\nfields the woods.\n \nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for\nthe kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel\nwailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I\nwished I was dead\u2014for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world.\n \nI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to\nProvidence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I\u2019d\nnoticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it\nalone.\n \nWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me,\nand of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such another powwow\nas they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you\nmay say\u2014spokes made out of dogs\u2014circle of fifteen of them packed together\naround me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and\nhowling; and more a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around\ncorners from everywheres.\n \nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand,\nsinging out, \u201cBegone you Tige! you Spot! begone sah!\u201d and she fetched\nfirst one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling, and then the\nrest followed; and the next second half of them come back, wagging their tails\naround me, and making friends with me. There ain\u2019t no harm in a hound, nohow.\n \nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys\nwithout anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother\u2019s\ngown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do.\nAnd here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or\nfifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her\ncomes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was\ndoing. She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand\u2014and says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s you, at last!\u2014ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n \nI out with a \u201cYes\u2019m\u201d before I thought.\n \nShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook\nand shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn\u2019t\nseem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t look as much like\nyour mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don\u2019t care for that, I\u2019m\nso glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up!\nChildren, it\u2019s your cousin Tom!\u2014tell him howdy.\u201d\n \nBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid\nbehind her. So she run on:\n \n\u201cLize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away\u2014or did you get your\nbreakfast on the boat?\u201d\n \nI said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house, leading me\nby the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got there she set me down\nin a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front\nof me, holding both of my hands, and says:\n \n\u201cNow I can have a good look at you; and, laws-a-me, I\u2019ve been hungry for\nit a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it\u2019s come at last! We\nbeen expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep\u2019 you?\u2014boat get aground?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2019m\u2014she\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t say yes\u2019m\u2014say Aunt Sally. Where\u2019d she get aground?\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t rightly know what to say, because I didn\u2019t know whether the boat would\nbe coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my\ninstinct said she would be coming up\u2014from down towards Orleans. That didn\u2019t\nhelp me much, though; for I didn\u2019t know the names of bars down that way. I see\nI\u2019d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on\u2014or\u2014Now\nI struck an idea, and fetched it out:\n \n\u201cIt warn\u2019t the grounding\u2014that didn\u2019t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a\ncylinder-head.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood gracious! anybody hurt?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2019m. Killed a nigger.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last\nChristmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally\nRook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he\ndied afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton\nRouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he did die.\nMortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn\u2019t save him.\nYes, it was mortification\u2014that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the\nhope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your\nuncle\u2019s been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he\u2019s gone again, not\nmore\u2019n an hour ago; he\u2019ll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the\nroad, didn\u2019t you?\u2014oldish man, with a\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I\nleft my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a\npiece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I\ncome down the back way.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho\u2019d you give the baggage to?\u201d\n \n\u201cNobody.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, child, it\u2019ll be stole!\u201d\n \n\u201cNot where I hid it I reckon it won\u2019t,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cHow\u2019d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\u201d\n \nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:\n \n\u201cThe captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat\nbefore I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers\u2019 lunch, and\ngive me all I wanted.\u201d\n \nI was getting so uneasy I couldn\u2019t listen good. I had my mind on the children\nall the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and\nfind out who I was. But I couldn\u2019t get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run\non so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because\nshe says:\n \n\u201cBut here we\u2019re a-running on this way, and you hain\u2019t told me a word about Sis,\nnor any of them. Now I\u2019ll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just\ntell me everything\u2014tell me all about \u2019m all every one of \u2019m; and how\nthey are, and what they\u2019re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every\nlast thing you can think of.\u201d\n \nWell, I see I was up a stump\u2014and up it good. Providence had stood by me this\nfur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it warn\u2019t a bit of\nuse to try to go ahead\u2014I\u2019d got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself,\nhere\u2019s another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin;\nbut she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:\n \n\u201cHere he comes! Stick your head down lower\u2014there, that\u2019ll do; you can\u2019t be seen\nnow. Don\u2019t you let on you\u2019re here. I\u2019ll play a joke on him. Children, don\u2019t you\nsay a word.\u201d\n \nI see I was in a fix now. But it warn\u2019t no use to worry; there warn\u2019t nothing\nto do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from under when the\nlightning struck.\n \nI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then the\nbed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:\n \n\u201cHas he come?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d says her husband.\n \n\u201cGood-ness gracious!\u201d she says, \u201cwhat in the warld can have become of\nhim?\u201d\n \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d says the old gentleman; \u201cand I must say it makes me dreadful\nuneasy.\u201d\n \n\u201cUneasy!\u201d she says; \u201cI\u2019m ready to go distracted! He must a come; and\nyou\u2019ve missed him along the road. I know it\u2019s so\u2014something tells me so.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Sally, I couldn\u2019t miss him along the road\u2014you know that.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut oh, dear, dear, what will Sis say! He must a come! You must a\nmissed him. He\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, don\u2019t distress me any more\u2019n I\u2019m already distressed. I don\u2019t know what in\nthe world to make of it. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end, and I don\u2019t mind acknowledging \u2019t\nI\u2019m right down scared. But there\u2019s no hope that he\u2019s come; for he\ncouldn\u2019t come and me miss him. Sally, it\u2019s terrible\u2014just\nterrible\u2014something\u2019s happened to the boat, sure!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Silas! Look yonder!\u2014up the road!\u2014ain\u2019t that somebody coming?\u201d\n \nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps the\nchance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a\npull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood,\na-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and\nsweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says:\n \n\u201cWhy, who\u2019s that?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho do you reckon \u2019t is?\u201d\n \n\u201cI hain\u2019t no idea. Who is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s Tom Sawyer!\u201d\n \nBy jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn\u2019t no time to swap\nknives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and\nall the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how\nthey both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the\ntribe.\n \nBut if they was joyful, it warn\u2019t nothing to what I was; for it was like being\nborn again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two\nhours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn\u2019t hardly go any more, I\nhad told them more about my family\u2014I mean the Sawyer family\u2014than ever happened\nto any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a\ncylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it.\nWhich was all right, and worked first-rate; because they didn\u2019t know but\nwhat it would take three days to fix it. If I\u2019d a called it a bolthead it would\na done just as well.\n \nNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty\nuncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and\nit stayed easy and comfortable till by-and-by I hear a steamboat coughing along\ndown the river. Then I says to myself, s\u2019pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that\nboat? And s\u2019pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I\ncan throw him a wink to keep quiet? Well, I couldn\u2019t have it that way;\nit wouldn\u2019t do at all. I must go up the road and waylay him. So I told the\nfolks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old\ngentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse\nmyself, and I druther he wouldn\u2019t take no trouble about me.\n",
        "\nSo I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon\ncoming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he\ncome along. I says \u201cHold on!\u201d and it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up\nlike a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person\nthat\u2019s got a dry throat, and then says:\n \n\u201cI hain\u2019t ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you want to come\nback and ha\u2019nt me for?\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cI hain\u2019t come back\u2014I hain\u2019t been gone.\u201d\n \nWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\u2019t quite satisfied\nyet. He says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\u2019t on you. Honest injun now, you\nain\u2019t a ghost?\u201d\n \n\u201cHonest injun, I ain\u2019t,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cWell\u2014I\u2014I\u2014well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\u2019t somehow seem to\nunderstand it no way. Looky here, warn\u2019t you ever murdered at all?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. I warn\u2019t ever murdered at all\u2014I played it on them. You come in here and\nfeel of me if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n \nSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again he\ndidn\u2019t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right off, because\nit was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. But\nI said, leave it alone till by-and-by; and told his driver to wait, and we\ndrove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what\ndid he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don\u2019t disturb\nhim. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s all right; I\u2019ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it\u2019s\nyour\u2019n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about\nthe time you ought to; and I\u2019ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh\nstart, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn\u2019t let\non to know me at first.\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cAll right; but wait a minute. There\u2019s one more thing\u2014a thing that\nnobody don\u2019t know but me. And that is, there\u2019s a nigger here that I\u2019m\na-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is Jim\u2014old Miss Watson\u2019s\nJim.\u201d\n \nHe says:\n \n\u201cWhat! Why, Jim is\u2014\u201d\n \nHe stopped and went to studying. I says:\n \n\u201cI know what you\u2019ll say. You\u2019ll say it\u2019s dirty, low-down business; but\nwhat if it is? I\u2019m low down; and I\u2019m a-going to steal him, and I want\nyou keep mum and not let on. Will you?\u201d\n \nHis eye lit up, and he says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll help you steal him!\u201d\n \nWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most astonishing\nspeech I ever heard\u2014and I\u2019m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my\nestimation. Only I couldn\u2019t believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealer!\n \n\u201cOh, shucks!\u201d I says; \u201cyou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n \n\u201cI ain\u2019t joking, either.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201cjoking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a\nrunaway nigger, don\u2019t forget to remember that you don\u2019t know nothing\nabout him, and I don\u2019t know nothing about him.\u201d\n \nThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way and I\ndrove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being\nglad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a\ntrip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says:\n \n\u201cWhy, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it?\nI wish we\u2019d a timed her. And she hain\u2019t sweated a hair\u2014not a hair. It\u2019s\nwonderful. Why, I wouldn\u2019t take a hundred dollars for that horse now\u2014I\nwouldn\u2019t, honest; and yet I\u2019d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought \u2019twas\nall she was worth.\u201d\n \nThat\u2019s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But it\nwarn\u2019t surprising; because he warn\u2019t only just a farmer, he was a preacher,\ntoo, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which\nhe built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never\ncharged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty\nother farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.\n \nIn about half an hour Tom\u2019s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally\nshe see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says:\n \n\u201cWhy, there\u2019s somebody come! I wonder who \u2019tis? Why, I do believe it\u2019s a\nstranger. Jimmy\u201d (that\u2019s one of the children) \u201crun and tell Lize to put on\nanother plate for dinner.\u201d\n \nEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don\u2019t\ncome every year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest,\nwhen he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon\nwas spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front\ndoor. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience\u2014and that was always nuts\nfor Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn\u2019t no trouble to him to throw in\nan amount of style that was suitable. He warn\u2019t a boy to meeky along up that\nyard like a sheep; no, he come ca\u2019m and important, like the ram. When he got\na-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid\nof a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn\u2019t want to disturb them,\nand says:\n \n\u201cMr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, my boy,\u201d says the old gentleman, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say \u2019t your driver has\ndeceived you; Nichols\u2019s place is down a matter of three mile more. Come in,\ncome in.\u201d\n \nTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \u201cToo late\u2014he\u2019s out of\nsight.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, he\u2019s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and\nthen we\u2019ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t make you so much trouble; I couldn\u2019t think of it. I\u2019ll\nwalk\u2014I don\u2019t mind the distance.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut we won\u2019t let you walk\u2014it wouldn\u2019t be Southern hospitality to do it.\nCome right in.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, do,\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201cit ain\u2019t a bit of trouble to us, not a bit\nin the world. You must stay. It\u2019s a long, dusty three mile, and we\ncan\u2019t let you walk. And, besides, I\u2019ve already told \u2019em to put on\nanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn\u2019t disappoint us. Come right\nin and make yourself at home.\u201d\n \nSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be persuaded,\nand come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville,\nOhio, and his name was William Thompson\u2014and he made another bow.\n \nWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody\nin it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how this\nwas going to help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he\nreached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back\nagain in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and\nwiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:\n \n\u201cYou owdacious puppy!\u201d\n \nHe looked kind of hurt, and says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at you, m\u2019am.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re s\u2019rp\u2014Why, what do you reckon I am? I\u2019ve a good notion to take and\u2014Say,\nwhat do you mean by kissing me?\u201d\n \nHe looked kind of humble, and says:\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean nothing, m\u2019am. I didn\u2019t mean no harm. I\u2014I\u2014thought you\u2019d like\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, you born fool!\u201d She took up the spinning stick, and it looked like it was\nall she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. \u201cWhat made you think\nI\u2019d like it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. Only, they\u2014they\u2014told me you would.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey told you I would. Whoever told you\u2019s another lunatic. I\nnever heard the beat of it. Who\u2019s they?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, everybody. They all said so, m\u2019am.\u201d\n \nIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers\nworked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\n \n\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018everybody\u2019? Out with their names, or ther\u2019ll be an idiot short.\u201d\n \nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, and I warn\u2019t expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to.\nThey all said, kiss her; and said she\u2019d like it. They all said it\u2014every one of\nthem. But I\u2019m sorry, m\u2019am, and I won\u2019t do it no more\u2014I won\u2019t, honest.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou won\u2019t, won\u2019t you? Well, I sh\u2019d reckon you won\u2019t!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2019m, I\u2019m honest about it; I won\u2019t ever do it again\u2014till you ask me.\u201d\n \n\u201cTill I ask you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay\nyou\u2019ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you\u2014or the\nlikes of you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cit does surprise me so. I can\u2019t make it out, somehow. They\nsaid you would, and I thought you would. But\u2014\u201d He stopped and looked around\nslow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched\nup on the old gentleman\u2019s, and says, \u201cDidn\u2019t you think she\u2019d like me to\nkiss her, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, no; I\u2014I\u2014well, no, I b\u2019lieve I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \nThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\n \n\u201cTom, didn\u2019t you think Aunt Sally \u2019d open out her arms and say, \u2018Sid\nSawyer\u2014\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cMy land!\u201d she says, breaking in and jumping for him, \u201cyou impudent young\nrascal, to fool a body so\u2014\u201d and was going to hug him, but he fended her off,\nand says:\n \n\u201cNo, not till you\u2019ve asked me first.\u201d\n \nSo she didn\u2019t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him over\nand over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took what was\nleft. And after they got a little quiet again she says:\n \n\u201cWhy, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn\u2019t looking for you at\nall, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s because it warn\u2019t intended for any of us to come but Tom,\u201d he\nsays; \u201cbut I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too;\nso, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise\nfor him to come here to the house first, and for me to by-and-by tag along and\ndrop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This\nain\u2019t no healthy place for a stranger to come.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain\u2019t been\nso put out since I don\u2019t know when. But I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t mind the\nterms\u2014I\u2019d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to\nthink of that performance! I don\u2019t deny it, I was most putrified with\nastonishment when you give me that smack.\u201d\n \nWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen;\nand there was things enough on that table for seven families\u2014and all hot, too;\nnone of your flabby, tough meat that\u2019s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all\nnight and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas\nhe asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn\u2019t\ncool it a bit, neither, the way I\u2019ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of\ntimes. There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and\nTom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn\u2019t no use, they didn\u2019t happen\nto say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to\nit. But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:\n \n\u201cPa, mayn\u2019t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d says the old man, \u201cI reckon there ain\u2019t going to be any; and you couldn\u2019t\ngo if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that\nscandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they\u2019ve\ndrove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.\u201d\n \nSo there it was!\u2014but I couldn\u2019t help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the\nsame room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right\nafter supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and\nshoved for the town; for I didn\u2019t believe anybody was going to give the king\nand the duke a hint, and so if I didn\u2019t hurry up and give them one they\u2019d get\ninto trouble sure.\n \nOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and\nhow pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn\u2019t come back no more, and what a stir\nthere was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch\nrapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck\ninto the town and up through the the middle of it\u2014it was as much as half-after\neight, then\u2014here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful\nwhooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to\none side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the\nduke astraddle of a rail\u2014that is, I knowed it was the king and the duke,\nthough they was all over tar and feathers, and didn\u2019t look like nothing in the\nworld that was human\u2014just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.\nWell, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals,\nit seemed like I couldn\u2019t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the\nworld. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings can be awful cruel\nto one another.\n \nWe see we was too late\u2014couldn\u2019t do no good. We asked some stragglers about it,\nand they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low\nand kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the\nstage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.\n \nSo we poked along back home, and I warn\u2019t feeling so brash as I was before, but\nkind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow\u2014though I hadn\u2019t done\nnothing. But that\u2019s always the way; it don\u2019t make no difference whether you do\nright or wrong, a person\u2019s conscience ain\u2019t got no sense, and just goes for him\nanyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn\u2019t know no more than a person\u2019s\nconscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a\nperson\u2019s insides, and yet ain\u2019t no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.\n",
        "\nWe stopped talking, and got to thinking. By-and-by Tom says:\n \n\u201cLooky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I know\nwhere Jim is.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! Where?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner,\ndidn\u2019t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did you think the vittles was for?\u201d\n \n\u201cFor a dog.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo\u2019d I. Well, it wasn\u2019t for a dog.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause part of it was watermelon.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo it was\u2014I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a\ndog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don\u2019t see at the\nsame time.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again\nwhen he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from\ntable\u2014same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain\u2019t\nlikely there\u2019s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the\npeople\u2019s all so kind and good. Jim\u2019s the prisoner. All right\u2014I\u2019m glad we found\nit out detective fashion; I wouldn\u2019t give shucks for any other way. Now you\nwork your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one,\ntoo; and we\u2019ll take the one we like the best.\u201d\n \nWhat a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer\u2019s head I wouldn\u2019t trade\nit off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor\nnothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be\ndoing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come\nfrom. Pretty soon Tom says:\n \n\u201cReady?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cAll right\u2014bring it out.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy plan is this,\u201d I says. \u201cWe can easy find out if it\u2019s Jim in there. Then get\nup my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the\nfirst dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man\u2019s britches after\nhe goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding\ndaytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn\u2019t\nthat plan work?\u201d\n \n\u201cWork? Why, cert\u2019nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it\u2019s too\nblame\u2019 simple; there ain\u2019t nothing to it. What\u2019s the good of a plan that\nain\u2019t no more trouble than that? It\u2019s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it\nwouldn\u2019t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.\u201d\n \nI never said nothing, because I warn\u2019t expecting nothing different; but I\nknowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn\u2019t have\nnone of them objections to it.\n \nAnd it didn\u2019t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth\nfifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would,\nand maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would\nwaltz in on it. I needn\u2019t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn\u2019t\nstay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way\nas we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And\nthat is what he done.\n \nWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and\nwas actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thing\nthat was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung\nup; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he\nwas bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean,\nbut kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or\nfeeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his\nfamily a shame, before everybody. I couldn\u2019t understand it no way at\nall. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so\nbe his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\nhimself. And I did start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you reckon I know what I\u2019m about? Don\u2019t I generly know what I\u2019m about?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I was going to help steal the nigger?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then.\u201d\n \nThat\u2019s all he said, and that\u2019s all I said. It warn\u2019t no use to say any more;\nbecause when he said he\u2019d do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn\u2019t\nmake out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and\nnever bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I\ncouldn\u2019t help it.\n \nWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the\nhut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard so as to see\nwhat the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn\u2019t make no more noise than\ncountry dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got\nto the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I\nwarn\u2019t acquainted with\u2014which was the north side\u2014we found a square window-hole,\nup tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\n \n\u201cHere\u2019s the ticket. This hole\u2019s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench\noff the board.\u201d\n \nTom says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I\nshould hope we can find a way that\u2019s a little more complicated than\nthat, Huck Finn.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201chow\u2019ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I\nwas murdered that time?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s more like,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s real mysterious, and troublesome, and\ngood,\u201d he says; \u201cbut I bet we can find a way that\u2019s twice as long. There ain\u2019t\nno hurry; le\u2019s keep on looking around.\u201d\n \nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the\nhut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but\nnarrow\u2014only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was\npadlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back\nthe iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the\nstaples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it,\nand struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\u2019t\nno connection with it; and there warn\u2019t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it\nbut some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\nThe match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door\nwas locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;\n \n\u201cNow we\u2019re all right. We\u2019ll dig him out. It\u2019ll take about a week!\u201d\n \nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door\u2014you only have to\npull a buckskin latch-string, they don\u2019t fasten the doors\u2014but that warn\u2019t\nromantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the\nlightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three times, and missed fire\nand fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought\nhe\u2019d got to give it up; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her\none more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip.\n \nIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet\nthe dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim\u2014if it was Jim\nthat was being fed. The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting\nfor the fields; and Jim\u2019s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat\nand things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.\n \nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied\nup in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the\nwitches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of\nstrange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn\u2019t\nbelieve he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up,\nand got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he\u2019d been\na-going to do. So Tom says:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?\u201d\n \nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a\nbrickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n \n\u201cYes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur\u2019us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at\n\u2019im?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \nI hunched Tom, and whispers:\n \n\u201cYou going, right here in the daybreak? That warn\u2019t the plan.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, it warn\u2019t; but it\u2019s the plan now.\u201d\n \nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn\u2019t like it much. When we got in we\ncouldn\u2019t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough,\nand could see us; and he sings out:\n \n\u201cWhy, Huck! En good lan\u2019! ain\u2019 dat Misto Tom?\u201d\n \nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn\u2019t know nothing\nto do; and if I had I couldn\u2019t a done it, because that nigger busted in and\nsays:\n \n\u201cWhy, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\u201d\n \nWe could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of\nwondering, and says:\n \n\u201cDoes who know us?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, dis-yer runaway nigger.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat put it dar? Didn\u2019 he jis\u2019 dis minute sing out like he knowed you?\u201d\n \nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\n \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out?\nwhat did he sing out?\u201d And turns to me, perfectly ca\u2019m, and says, \u201cDid\nyou hear anybody sing out?\u201d\n \nOf course there warn\u2019t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n \n\u201cNo; I ain\u2019t heard nobody say nothing.\u201d\n \nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and\nsays:\n \n\u201cDid you sing out?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah,\u201d says Jim; \u201cI hain\u2019t said nothing, sah.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot a word?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah, I hain\u2019t said a word.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you ever see us before?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah; not as I knows on.\u201d\n \nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says,\nkind of severe:\n \n\u201cWhat do you reckon\u2019s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody\nsung out?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, it\u2019s de dad-blame\u2019 witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey\u2019s awluz\nat it, sah, en dey do mos\u2019 kill me, dey sk\u2019yers me so. Please to don\u2019t tell\nnobody \u2019bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\u2019ll scole me; \u2019kase he say dey\nain\u2019t no witches. I jis\u2019 wish to goodness he was heah now\u2014den\nwhat would he say! I jis\u2019 bet he couldn\u2019 fine no way to git aroun\u2019 it\ndis time. But it\u2019s awluz jis\u2019 so; people dat\u2019s sot, stays sot;\ndey won\u2019t look into noth\u2019n\u2019en fine it out f\u2019r deyselves, en when you\nfine it out en tell um \u2019bout it, dey doan\u2019 b\u2019lieve you.\u201d\n \nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\u2019t tell nobody; and told him to buy some\nmore thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:\n \n\u201cI wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a\nnigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn\u2019t give him up,\nI\u2019d hang him.\u201d And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime\nand bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights,\nit\u2019s us; we\u2019re going to set you free.\u201d\n \nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come\nback, and we said we\u2019d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he\nsaid he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him\nmostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.\n",
        "\nIt would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into\nthe woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig\nby, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must\nhave was a lot of them rotten chunks that\u2019s called fox-fire, and just makes a\nsoft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We fetched an armful and\nhid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\n \n\u201cBlame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it\nmakes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain\u2019t no\nwatchman to be drugged\u2014now there ought to be a watchman. There ain\u2019t\neven a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there\u2019s Jim chained by one leg,\nwith a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift\nup the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody;\nsends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don\u2019t send nobody to watch the\nnigger. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there\nwouldn\u2019t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat\nit, Huck, it\u2019s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent\nall the difficulties. Well, we can\u2019t help it; we got to do the best we\ncan with the materials we\u2019ve got. Anyhow, there\u2019s one thing\u2014there\u2019s more honor\nin getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there\nwarn\u2019t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to\nfurnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look\nat just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we\nsimply got to let on that a lantern\u2019s resky. Why, we could work with a\ntorchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of\nit, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do we want of a saw?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do we want of it? Hain\u2019t we got to saw the leg of Jim\u2019s bed off,\nso as to get the chain loose?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, if that ain\u2019t just like you, Huck Finn. You can get up the\ninfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain\u2019t you ever read any books\nat all?\u2014Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor\nnone of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an\nold-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the\nbed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\u2019t be\nfound, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest\nseneskal can\u2019t see no sign of it\u2019s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is\nperfectly sound. Then, the night you\u2019re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she\ngoes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope\nladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat\u2014because a\nrope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know\u2014and there\u2019s your horses and\nyour trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and\naway you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It\u2019s gaudy,\nHuck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the\nescape, we\u2019ll dig one.\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cWhat do we want of a moat when we\u2019re going to snake him out from under the\ncabin?\u201d\n \nBut he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in\nhis hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again,\nand says:\n \n\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t do\u2014there ain\u2019t necessity enough for it.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor what?\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cWhy, to saw Jim\u2019s leg off,\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cGood land!\u201d I says; \u201cwhy, there ain\u2019t no necessity for it. And what\nwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn\u2019t get the chain\noff, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would be better\nstill. But we got to let that go. There ain\u2019t necessity enough in this case;\nand, besides, Jim\u2019s a nigger, and wouldn\u2019t understand the reasons for it, and\nhow it\u2019s the custom in Europe; so we\u2019ll let it go. But there\u2019s one thing\u2014he can\nhave a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy\nenough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it\u2019s mostly done that way. And I\u2019ve\net worse pies.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\u201d I says; \u201cJim ain\u2019t got no use for a rope\nladder.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe has got use for it. How you talk, you better say; you don\u2019t\nknow nothing about it. He\u2019s got to have a rope ladder; they all do.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat in the nation can he do with it?\u201d\n \n\u201cDo with it? He can hide it in his bed, can\u2019t he?\u201d That\u2019s what they all\ndo; and he\u2019s got to, too. Huck, you don\u2019t ever seem to want to do\nanything that\u2019s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time.\nS\u2019pose he don\u2019t do nothing with it? ain\u2019t it there in his bed, for a\nclew, after he\u2019s gone? and don\u2019t you reckon they\u2019ll want clews? Of course they\nwill. And you wouldn\u2019t leave them any? That would be a pretty howdy-do,\nwouldn\u2019t it! I never heard of such a thing.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cif it\u2019s in the regulations, and he\u2019s got to have it, all\nright, let him have it; because I don\u2019t wish to go back on no regulations; but\nthere\u2019s one thing, Tom Sawyer\u2014if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a\nrope ladder, we\u2019re going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as\nyou\u2019re born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don\u2019t cost\nnothing, and don\u2019t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with,\nand hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he\nain\u2019t had no experience, and so he don\u2019t care what kind of a\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\u2019d keep still\u2014that\u2019s what\nI\u2019d do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark\nladder? Why, it\u2019s perfectly ridiculous.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\u2019ll take my advice,\nyou\u2019ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\u201d\n \nHe said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:\n \n\u201cBorrow a shirt, too.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do we want of a shirt, Tom?\u201d\n \n\u201cWant it for Jim to keep a journal on.\u201d\n \n\u201cJournal your granny\u2014Jim can\u2019t write.\u201d\n \n\u201cS\u2019pose he can\u2019t write\u2014he can make marks on the shirt, can\u2019t he, if we\nmake him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron\nbarrel-hoop?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and\nquicker, too.\u201d\n \n\u201cPrisoners don\u2019t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens\nout of, you muggins. They always make their pens out of the hardest,\ntoughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that\nthey can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and\nmonths to file it out, too, because they\u2019ve got to do it by rubbing it on the\nwall. They wouldn\u2019t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain\u2019t regular.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what\u2019ll we make him the ink out of?\u201d\n \n\u201cMany makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\u2019s the common sort and\nwomen; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and when he\nwants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world\nknow where he\u2019s captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a\nfork and throw it out of the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it\u2019s a\nblame\u2019 good way, too.\u201d\n \n\u201cJim ain\u2019t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat ain\u2019t nothing; we can get him some.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan\u2019t nobody read his plates.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat ain\u2019t got anything to do with it, Huck Finn. All he\u2019s got\nto do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don\u2019t have to be\nable to read it. Why, half the time you can\u2019t read anything a prisoner writes\non a tin plate, or anywhere else.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what\u2019s the sense in wasting the plates?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, blame it all, it ain\u2019t the prisoner\u2019s plates.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut it\u2019s somebody\u2019s plates, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, spos\u2019n it is? What does the prisoner care whose\u2014\u201d\n \nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared\nout for the house.\n \nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the\nclothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and\ngot the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was\nwhat pap always called it; but Tom said it warn\u2019t borrowing, it was stealing.\nHe said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don\u2019t care how they get a\nthing so they get it, and nobody don\u2019t blame them for it, either. It ain\u2019t no\ncrime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said;\nit\u2019s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a\nperfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get\nourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn\u2019t prisoners it would be a very\ndifferent thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he\nwarn\u2019t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come\nhandy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a\nwatermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the\nniggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he\nmeant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the\nwatermelon. But he said I didn\u2019t need it to get out of prison with; there\u2019s\nwhere the difference was. He said if I\u2019d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and\nsmuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I\nlet it go at that, though I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in my representing a\nprisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions\nlike that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\n \nWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down\nto business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack\ninto the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By-and-by he come\nout, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. He says:\n \n\u201cEverything\u2019s all right now except tools; and that\u2019s easy fixed.\u201d\n \n\u201cTools?\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cTools for what?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, to dig with. We ain\u2019t a-going to gnaw him out, are we?\u201d\n \n\u201cAin\u2019t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger\nout with?\u201d I says.\n \nHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\n \n\u201cHuck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,\nand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I\nwant to ask you\u2014if you got any reasonableness in you at all\u2014what kind of a show\nwould that give him to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the\nkey and done with it. Picks and shovels\u2014why, they wouldn\u2019t furnish \u2019em to a\nking.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then,\u201d I says, \u201cif we don\u2019t want the picks and shovels, what do we\nwant?\u201d\n \n\u201cA couple of case-knives.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cConfound it, it\u2019s foolish, Tom.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt don\u2019t make no difference how foolish it is, it\u2019s the right way\u2014and\nit\u2019s the regular way. And there ain\u2019t no other way, that ever I\nheard of, and I\u2019ve read all the books that gives any information about these\nthings. They always dig out with a case-knife\u2014and not through dirt, mind you;\ngenerly it\u2019s through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks,\nand for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon\nof the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way;\nhow long was he at it, you reckon?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, guess.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. A month and a half.\u201d\n \n\u201cThirty-seven year\u2014and he come out in China. That\u2019s the kind. I\nwish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.\u201d\n \n\u201cJim don\u2019t know nobody in China.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But\nyou\u2019re always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can\u2019t you stick to the main\npoint?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right\u2014I don\u2019t care where he comes out, so he comes out; and\nJim don\u2019t, either, I reckon. But there\u2019s one thing, anyway\u2014Jim\u2019s too old to be\ndug out with a case-knife. He won\u2019t last.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes he will last, too. You don\u2019t reckon it\u2019s going to take thirty-seven\nyears to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow long will it take, Tom?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\u2019t take very\nlong for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He\u2019ll hear Jim\nain\u2019t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something\nlike that. So we can\u2019t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By\nrights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can\u2019t. Things being so\nuncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as\nwe can; and after that, we can let on, to ourselves, that we was at it\nthirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time\nthere\u2019s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that\u2019ll be the best way.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, there\u2019s sense in that,\u201d I says. \u201cLetting on don\u2019t cost nothing;\nletting on ain\u2019t no trouble; and if it\u2019s any object, I don\u2019t mind letting on we\nwas at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn\u2019t strain me none, after I got my\nhand in. So I\u2019ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.\u201d\n \n\u201cSmouch three,\u201d he says; \u201cwe want one to make a saw out of.\u201d\n \n\u201cTom, if it ain\u2019t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\u201d I says, \u201cthere\u2019s an\nold rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind\nthe smoke-house.\u201d\n \nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and smouch the\nknives\u2014three of them.\u201d So I done it.\n",
        "\nAs soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\nlightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of\nfox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or\nfive foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said he was right behind\nJim\u2019s bed now, and we\u2019d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn\u2019t\nnobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim\u2019s\ncounter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you\u2019d have to raise it up and\nlook under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most\nmidnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you\ncouldn\u2019t see we\u2019d done anything hardly. At last I says:\n \n\u201cThis ain\u2019t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom\nSawyer.\u201d\n \nHe never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and\nthen for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no use, Huck, it ain\u2019t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would,\nbecause then we\u2019d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we\nwouldn\u2019t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing\nwatches, and so our hands wouldn\u2019t get blistered, and we could keep it up right\nalong, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done.\nBut we can\u2019t fool along; we got to rush; we ain\u2019t got no time to spare.\nIf we was to put in another night this way we\u2019d have to knock off for a week to\nlet our hands get well\u2014couldn\u2019t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what we going to do, Tom?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. It ain\u2019t right, and it ain\u2019t moral, and I wouldn\u2019t like it to\nget out; but there ain\u2019t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the\npicks, and let on it\u2019s case-knives.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow you\u2019re talking!\u201d I says; \u201cyour head gets leveler and leveler\nall the time, Tom Sawyer,\u201d I says. \u201cPicks is the thing, moral or no moral; and\nas for me, I don\u2019t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in\nto steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain\u2019t no ways\nparticular how it\u2019s done so it\u2019s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want\nis my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick\u2019s the\nhandiest thing, that\u2019s the thing I\u2019m a-going to dig that nigger or that\nwatermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don\u2019t give a dead rat\nwhat the authorities thinks about it nuther.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this;\nif it warn\u2019t so, I wouldn\u2019t approve of it, nor I wouldn\u2019t stand by and see the\nrules broke\u2014because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain\u2019t got no\nbusiness doing wrong when he ain\u2019t ignorant and knows better. It might answer\nfor you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on,\nbecause you don\u2019t know no better; but it wouldn\u2019t for me, because I do know\nbetter. Gimme a case-knife.\u201d\n \nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:\n \n\u201cGimme a case-knife.\u201d\n \nI didn\u2019t know just what to do\u2014but then I thought. I scratched around amongst\nthe old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to\nwork, and never said a word.\n \nHe was always just that particular. Full of principle.\n \nSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made\nthe fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could\nstand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs\nI looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the\nlightning-rod, but he couldn\u2019t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says:\n \n\u201cIt ain\u2019t no use, it can\u2019t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can\u2019t you\nthink of no way?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d I says, \u201cbut I reckon it ain\u2019t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on\nit\u2019s a lightning-rod.\u201d\n \nSo he done it.\n \nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to\nmake some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the\nnigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it\nwasn\u2019t enough; but I said nobody wouldn\u2019t ever see the plates that Jim throwed\nout, because they\u2019d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the\nwindow-hole\u2014then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So\nTom was satisfied. Then he says:\n \n\u201cNow, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\u201d\n \n\u201cTake them in through the hole,\u201d I says, \u201cwhen we get it done.\u201d\n \nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of\nsuch an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he said he had\nciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\u2019t no need to decide on any of\nthem yet. Said we\u2019d got to post Jim first.\n \nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of\nthe candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring;\nso we pitched it in, and it didn\u2019t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick\nand shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in\nunder Jim\u2019s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and\nlit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy,\nand then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most\ncried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was\nfor having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right\naway, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how\nunregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how\nwe could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the\nleast afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it\nwas all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom\nasked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day\nor two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable\nand had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\n \n\u201cNow I know how to fix it. We\u2019ll send you some things by them.\u201d\n \nI said, \u201cDon\u2019t do nothing of the kind; it\u2019s one of the most jackass ideas I\never struck;\u201d but he never paid no attention to me; went right on. It was his\nway when he\u2019d got his plans set.\n \nSo he told Jim how we\u2019d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large\nthings by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not\nbe surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things\nin uncle\u2019s coat-pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to\naunt\u2019s apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and\ntold him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a\njournal on the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim\nhe couldn\u2019t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks\nand knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all\njust as Tom said.\n \nJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable\ntime; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that\nlooked like they\u2019d been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the\nbest fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he\nonly could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and\nleave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it\nbetter and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could\nbe strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.\nAnd he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\n \nIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick\ninto handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we\nwent to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\u2019s notice off, Tom shoved a piece\nof candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim\u2019s pan, and we\nwent along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when\nJim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn\u2019t ever\nanything could a worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but\nwhat it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that\u2019s always\ngetting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what\nhe jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\n \nAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of\nthe hounds bulging in from under Jim\u2019s bed; and they kept on piling in till\nthere was eleven of them, and there warn\u2019t hardly room in there to get your\nbreath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only\njust hollered \u201cWitches\u201d once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs,\nand begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a\nslab of Jim\u2019s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out\nhimself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he\u2019d fixed the other\ndoor too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\nasking him if he\u2019d been imagining he saw something again. He raised up, and\nblinked his eyes around, and says:\n \n\u201cMars Sid, you\u2019ll say I\u2019s a fool, but if I didn\u2019t b\u2019lieve I see most a million\ndogs, er devils, er some\u2019n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did,\nmos\u2019 sholy. Mars Sid, I felt um\u2014I felt um, sah; dey was all over\nme. Dad fetch it, I jis\u2019 wisht I could git my han\u2019s on one er dem witches jis\u2019\nwunst\u2014on\u2019y jis\u2019 wunst\u2014it\u2019s all I\u2019d ast. But mos\u2019ly I wisht dey\u2019d lemme\n\u2019lone, I does.\u201d\n \nTom says:\n \n\u201cWell, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this\nrunaway nigger\u2019s breakfast-time? It\u2019s because they\u2019re hungry; that\u2019s the\nreason. You make them a witch pie; that\u2019s the thing for you to do.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut my lan\u2019, Mars Sid, how\u2019s I gwyne to make \u2019m a witch pie? I doan\u2019\nknow how to make it. I hain\u2019t ever hearn er sich a thing b\u2019fo\u2019.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll have to make it myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWill you do it, honey?\u2014will you? I\u2019ll wusshup de groun\u2019 und\u2019 yo\u2019 foot, I\nwill!\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do it, seeing it\u2019s you, and you\u2019ve been good to us and showed\nus the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When we come around,\nyou turn your back; and then whatever we\u2019ve put in the pan, don\u2019t you let on\nyou see it at all. And don\u2019t you look when Jim unloads the pan\u2014something might\nhappen, I don\u2019t know what. And above all, don\u2019t you handle the\nwitch-things.\u201d\n \n\u201cHannel \u2019m, Mars Sid? What is you a-talkin\u2019 \u2019bout? I wouldn\u2019 lay\nde weight er my finger on um, not f\u2019r ten hund\u2019d thous\u2019n billion dollars, I\nwouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n",
        "\nThat was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the\nback yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and\nwore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old\ntin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in,\nand took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast,\nand found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner\nto scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of\nthem in Aunt Sally\u2019s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t\u2019other we\nstuck in the band of Uncle Silas\u2019s hat, which was on the bureau, because we\nheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger\u2019s house\nthis morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in\nUncle Silas\u2019s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn\u2019t come yet, so we had to wait a\nlittle while.\n \nAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn\u2019t hardly wait for\nthe blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and\ncracking the handiest child\u2019s head with her thimble with the other, and says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve hunted high and I\u2019ve hunted low, and it does beat all what has\nbecome of your other shirt.\u201d\n \nMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of\ncorn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a\ncough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye\nand curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a\nwarwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted\nto a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as\nthat, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder. But after\nthat we was all right again\u2014it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so\nkind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s most uncommon curious, I can\u2019t understand it. I know perfectly well I\ntook it off, because\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause you hain\u2019t got but one on. Just listen at the man!\nI know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your\nwool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo\u2019s-line yesterday\u2014I see it\nthere myself. But it\u2019s gone, that\u2019s the long and the short of it, and you\u2019ll\njust have to change to a red flann\u2019l one till I can get time to make a new one.\nAnd it\u2019ll be the third I\u2019ve made in two years. It just keeps a body on the\njump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with \u2019m all\nis more\u2019n I can make out. A body \u2019d think you would learn to take\nsome sort of care of \u2019em at your time of life.\u201d\n \n\u201cI know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn\u2019t to be altogether my\nfault, because, you know, I don\u2019t see them nor have nothing to do with them\nexcept when they\u2019re on me; and I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever lost one of them\noff of me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t your fault if you haven\u2019t, Silas; you\u2019d a done it if you\ncould, I reckon. And the shirt ain\u2019t all that\u2019s gone, nuther. Ther\u2019s a spoon\ngone; and that ain\u2019t all. There was ten, and now ther\u2019s only nine. The\ncalf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that\u2019s\ncertain.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, what else is gone, Sally?\u201d\n \n\u201cTher\u2019s six candles gone\u2014that\u2019s what. The rats could a got the candles,\nand I reckon they did; I wonder they don\u2019t walk off with the whole place, the\nway you\u2019re always going to stop their holes and don\u2019t do it; and if they warn\u2019t\nfools they\u2019d sleep in your hair, Silas\u2014you\u2019d never find it out; but you\ncan\u2019t lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, Sally, I\u2019m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I\u2019ve been remiss; but I won\u2019t\nlet to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t hurry; next year\u2019ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta\nPhelps!\u201d\n \nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl\nwithout fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage,\nand says:\n \n\u201cMissus, dey\u2019s a sheet gone.\u201d\n \n\u201cA sheet gone! Well, for the land\u2019s sake!\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll stop up them holes to-day,\u201d says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\n \n\u201cOh, do shet up!\u2014s\u2019pose the rats took the sheet? Where\u2019s it gone,\nLize?\u201d\n \n\u201cClah to goodness I hain\u2019t no notion, Miss\u2019 Sally. She wuz on de clo\u2019sline\nyistiddy, but she done gone: she ain\u2019 dah no mo\u2019 now.\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon the world is coming to an end. I never see the beat of\nit in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cMissus,\u201d comes a young yaller wench, \u201cdey\u2019s a brass cannelstick miss\u2019n.\u201d\n \n\u201cCler out from here, you hussy, er I\u2019ll take a skillet to ye!\u201d\n \nWell, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would\nsneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She kept a-raging\nright along, running her insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty\nmeek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up\nthat spoon out of his pocket. She stopped, with her mouth open and her hands\nup; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long,\nbecause she says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time; and\nlike as not you\u2019ve got the other things there, too. How\u2019d it get there?\u201d\n \n\u201cI reely don\u2019t know, Sally,\u201d he says, kind of apologizing, \u201cor you know I would\ntell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I\nreckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it\nmust be so, because my Testament ain\u2019t in; but I\u2019ll go and see; and if the\nTestament is where I had it, I\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t put it in, and that will show\nthat I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, for the land\u2019s sake! Give a body a rest! Go \u2019long now, the whole kit and\nbiling of ye; and don\u2019t come nigh me again till I\u2019ve got back my peace of\nmind.\u201d\n \nI\u2019d a heard her if she\u2019d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it\nout; and I\u2019d a got up and obeyed her if I\u2019d a been dead. As we was passing\nthrough the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the shingle-nail\nfell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the\nmantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and\nremembered about the spoon, and says:\n \n\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t no use to send things by him no more, he ain\u2019t\nreliable.\u201d Then he says: \u201cBut he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway,\nwithout knowing it, and so we\u2019ll go and do him one without him knowing\nit\u2014stop up his rat-holes.\u201d\n \nThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole hour,\nbut we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard steps on the\nstairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a\ncandle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t\u2019other, looking as absent-minded\nas year before last. He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then\nanother, till he\u2019d been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking\ntallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy\ntowards the stairs, saying:\n \n\u201cWell, for the life of me I can\u2019t remember when I done it. I could show her now\nthat I warn\u2019t to blame on account of the rats. But never mind\u2014let it go. I\nreckon it wouldn\u2019t do no good.\u201d\n \nAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice\nold man. And always is.\n \nTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we\u2019d got\nto have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told me how we\nwas to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt\nSally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to\none side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Aunt Sally, there ain\u2019t but nine spoons yet.\u201d\n \nShe says:\n \n\u201cGo \u2019long to your play, and don\u2019t bother me. I know better, I counted \u2019m\nmyself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can\u2019t make but nine.\u201d\n \nShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count\u2014anybody would.\n \n\u201cI declare to gracious ther\u2019 ain\u2019t but nine!\u201d she says. \u201cWhy, what in\nthe world\u2014plague take the things, I\u2019ll count \u2019m again.\u201d\n \nSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:\n \n\u201cHang the troublesome rubbage, ther\u2019s ten now!\u201d and she looked huffy and\nbothered both. But Tom says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Aunty, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ten.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou numskull, didn\u2019t you see me count \u2019m?\u201d\n \n\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll count \u2019m again.\u201d\n \nSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she\nwas in a tearing way\u2014just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But she\ncounted and counted till she got that addled she\u2019d start to count in the\nbasket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right,\nand three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed\nit across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle\u2019r out and\nlet her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that\nand dinner she\u2019d skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her\napron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all\nright, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied\nwith this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\nbecause he said now she couldn\u2019t ever count them spoons twice alike\nagain to save her life; and wouldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d counted them right if she\ndid; and said that after she\u2019d about counted her head off for the next\nthree days he judged she\u2019d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her\nto ever count them any more.\n \nSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her\ncloset; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days\ntill she didn\u2019t know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn\u2019t\ncare, and warn\u2019t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it,\nand wouldn\u2019t count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.\n \nSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the\ncandles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as\nto the candlestick, it warn\u2019t no consequence, it would blow over by-and-by.\n \nBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up\naway down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and\nvery satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three\nwash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all\nover, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn\u2019t\nwant nothing but a crust, and we couldn\u2019t prop it up right, and she would\nalways cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last\u2014which was to\ncook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night,\nand tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\nbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with. We\nlet on it took nine months to make it.\n \nAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn\u2019t go into the\npie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty\npies if we\u2019d a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or\nanything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner.\n \nBut we didn\u2019t need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we\nthrowed the rest away. We didn\u2019t cook none of the pies in the wash-pan\u2014afraid\nthe solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which\nhe thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a\nlong wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in\nthe Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with\na lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being\nany account, because they warn\u2019t, but on account of them being relicts, you\nknow, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed\non the first pies, because we didn\u2019t know how, but she come up smiling on the\nlast one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\nloaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid,\nand put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool\nand comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a\nsatisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple\nof kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn\u2019t cramp him down to\nbusiness I don\u2019t know nothing what I\u2019m talking about, and lay him in enough\nstomach-ache to last him till next time, too.\n \nNat didn\u2019t look when we put the witch pie in Jim\u2019s pan; and we put the three\ntin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got\neverything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie\nand hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a\ntin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.\n",
        "\nMaking them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim\nallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That\u2019s the one\nwhich the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said\nhe\u2019d got to; there warn\u2019t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his\ninscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\n \n\u201cLook at Lady Jane Grey,\u201d he says; \u201clook at Gilford Dudley; look at old\nNorthumberland! Why, Huck, s\u2019pose it is considerble trouble?\u2014what you\ngoing to do?\u2014how you going to get around it? Jim\u2019s got to do his\ninscription and coat of arms. They all do.\u201d\n \nJim says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I hain\u2019t got no coat o\u2019 arm; I hain\u2019t got nuffn but dish yer\nole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I says, \u201cJim\u2019s right, anyway, when he says he ain\u2019t got no coat of\narms, because he hain\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cI reckon I knowed that,\u201d Tom says, \u201cbut you bet he\u2019ll have one before\nhe goes out of this\u2014because he\u2019s going out right, and there ain\u2019t going\nto be no flaws in his record.\u201d\n \nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making\nhis\u2019n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to\nthink out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he\u2019d struck so many good ones he\ndidn\u2019t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he\u2019d\ndecide on. He says:\n \n\u201cOn the scutcheon we\u2019ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire\nmurrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under\nhis foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief\nengrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril\npoints rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable,\nwith his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for\nsupporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto.\nGot it out of a book\u2014means the more haste, the less speed.\u201d\n \n\u201cGeewhillikins,\u201d I says, \u201cbut what does the rest of it mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got no time to bother over that,\u201d he says; \u201cwe got to dig in like all\ngit-out.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, anyway,\u201d I says, \u201cwhat\u2019s some of it? What\u2019s a fess?\u201d\n \n\u201cA fess\u2014a fess is\u2014you don\u2019t need to know what a fess is. I\u2019ll show him\nhow to make it when he gets to it.\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks, Tom,\u201d I says, \u201cI think you might tell a person. What\u2019s a bar\nsinister?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s got to have it. All the nobility does.\u201d\n \nThat was just his way. If it didn\u2019t suit him to explain a thing to you, he\nwouldn\u2019t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn\u2019t make no difference.\n \nHe\u2019d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish\nup the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful\ninscription\u2014said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and\nwrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:\n \n1. Here a captive heart busted.\n \n2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his\nsorrowful life.\n \n3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after\nthirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\n \n4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter\ncaptivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\n \nTom\u2019s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When\nhe got done he couldn\u2019t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble\non to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him\nscrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot\nof truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn\u2019t know how to make letters,\nbesides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn\u2019t\nhave nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\n \n\u201cCome to think, the logs ain\u2019t a-going to do; they don\u2019t have log walls in a\ndungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We\u2019ll fetch a rock.\u201d\n \nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a\npison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn\u2019t ever get out. But Tom said\nhe would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was\ngetting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and\ndidn\u2019t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn\u2019t seem to\nmake no headway, hardly; so Tom says:\n \n\u201cI know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful\ninscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There\u2019s a gaudy\nbig grindstone down at the mill, and we\u2019ll smouch it, and carve the things on\nit, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.\u201d\n \nIt warn\u2019t no slouch of an idea; and it warn\u2019t no slouch of a grindstone nuther;\nbut we allowed we\u2019d tackle it. It warn\u2019t quite midnight yet, so we cleared out\nfor the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, and set out to\nroll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could,\nwe couldn\u2019t keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us\nevery time. Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got\nthrough. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most\ndrownded with sweat. We see it warn\u2019t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he\nraised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and\nround his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and\nme laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom\nsuperintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do\neverything.\n \nOur hole was pretty big, but it warn\u2019t big enough to get the grindstone\nthrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked\nout them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail\nfor a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and\ntold him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go\nto bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we\nhelped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.\nBut Tom thought of something, and says:\n \n\u201cYou got any spiders in here, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah, thanks to goodness I hain\u2019t, Mars Tom.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll get you some.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut bless you, honey, I doan\u2019 want none. I\u2019s afeard un um. I jis\u2019 \u2019s\nsoon have rattlesnakes aroun\u2019.\u201d\n \nTom thought a minute or two, and says:\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea. And I reckon it\u2019s been done. It must a been done; it\nstands to reason. Yes, it\u2019s a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?\u201d\n \n\u201cKeep what, Mars Tom?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, a rattlesnake.\u201d\n \n\u201cDe goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in\nheah I\u2019d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Jim, you wouldn\u2019t be afraid of it after a little. You could tame it.\u201d\n \n\u201cTame it!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they\nwouldn\u2019t think of hurting a person that pets them. Any book will tell\nyou that. You try\u2014that\u2019s all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you\ncan get him so, in a little while, that he\u2019ll love you; and sleep with you; and\nwon\u2019t stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck\nand put his head in your mouth.\u201d\n \n\u201cPlease, Mars Tom\u2014doan\u2019 talk so! I can\u2019t stan\u2019 it! He\u2019d\nlet me shove his head in my mouf\u2014fer a favor, hain\u2019t it? I lay he\u2019d wait\na pow\u2019ful long time \u2019fo\u2019 I ast him. En mo\u2019 en dat, I doan\u2019 want\nhim to sleep wid me.\u201d\n \n\u201cJim, don\u2019t act so foolish. A prisoner\u2019s got to have some kind of a dumb\npet, and if a rattlesnake hain\u2019t ever been tried, why, there\u2019s more glory to be\ngained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever\nthink of to save your life.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan\u2019 want no sich glory. Snake take \u2019n bite Jim\u2019s\nchin off, den whah is de glory? No, sah, I doan\u2019 want no sich doin\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201cBlame it, can\u2019t you try? I only want you to try\u2014you needn\u2019t keep\nit up if it don\u2019t work.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while I\u2019s a tryin\u2019 him.\nMars Tom, I\u2019s willin\u2019 to tackle mos\u2019 anything \u2019at ain\u2019t onreasonable, but ef\nyou en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I\u2019s gwyne to\nleave, dat\u2019s shore.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, let it go, let it go, if you\u2019re so bull-headed about it. We can\nget you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and\nlet on they\u2019re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that\u2019ll have to do.\u201d\n \n\u201cI k\u2019n stan\u2019 dem, Mars Tom, but blame\u2019 \u2019f I couldn\u2019 get along widout um,\nI tell you dat. I never knowed b\u2019fo\u2019 \u2019t was so much bother and trouble to be a\nprisoner.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it always is when it\u2019s done right. You got any rats around here?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sah, I hain\u2019t seed none.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll get you some rats.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I doan\u2019 want no rats. Dey\u2019s de dadblamedest creturs to\n\u2019sturb a body, en rustle roun\u2019 over \u2019im, en bite his feet, when he\u2019s tryin\u2019 to\nsleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g\u2019yarter-snakes, \u2019f I\u2019s got to have \u2019m, but\ndoan\u2019 gimme no rats; I hain\u2019 got no use f\u2019r um, skasely.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, Jim, you got to have \u2019em\u2014they all do. So don\u2019t make no more fuss\nabout it. Prisoners ain\u2019t ever without rats. There ain\u2019t no instance of it. And\nthey train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as\nsociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play\nmusic on?\u201d\n \n\u201cI ain\u2019 got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o\u2019 paper, en a juice-harp; but I\nreck\u2019n dey wouldn\u2019 take no stock in a juice-harp.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes they would. They don\u2019t care what kind of music \u2019tis. A jews-harp\u2019s\nplenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music\u2014in a prison they dote on\nit. Specially, painful music; and you can\u2019t get no other kind out of a\njews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what\u2019s the matter\nwith you. Yes, you\u2019re all right; you\u2019re fixed very well. You want to set on\nyour bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play\nyour jews-harp; play \u2018The Last Link is Broken\u2019\u2014that\u2019s the thing that\u2019ll scoop\na rat quicker \u2019n anything else; and when you\u2019ve played about two minutes you\u2019ll\nsee all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried\nabout you, and come. And they\u2019ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble\ngood time.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, dey will, I reck\u2019n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim\nhavin\u2019? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I\u2019ll do it ef I got to. I reck\u2019n I\nbetter keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.\u201d\n \nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn\u2019t nothing else; and pretty\nsoon he says:\n \n\u201cOh, there\u2019s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?\u201d\n \n\u201cI doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it\u2019s tolable dark in heah, en I\nain\u2019 got no use f\u2019r no flower, nohow, en she\u2019d be a pow\u2019ful sight o\u2019 trouble.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.\u201d\n \n\u201cOne er dem big cat-tail-lookin\u2019 mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I\nreck\u2019n, but she wouldn\u2019t be wuth half de trouble she\u2019d coss.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you believe it. We\u2019ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the\ncorner over there, and raise it. And don\u2019t call it mullen, call it\nPitchiola\u2014that\u2019s its right name when it\u2019s in a prison. And you want to water it\nwith your tears.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It\u2019s\nthe way they always do.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring\nwater whiles another man\u2019s a start\u2019n one wid tears.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the idea. You got to do it with tears.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe\u2019ll die on my han\u2019s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan\u2019 skasely ever\ncry.\u201d\n \nSo Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to\nworry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the\nnigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim\u2019s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim\nsaid he would \u201cjis\u2019 \u2019s soon have tobacker in his coffee;\u201d and found so much\nfault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and\njews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and\nthings, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions,\nand journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and\nresponsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most\nlost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more\ngaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for\nhimself, and yet he didn\u2019t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just\nabout wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn\u2019t behave so no\nmore, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.\n",
        "\nIn the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched\nit down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen\nof the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place\nunder Aunt Sally\u2019s bed. But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas\nFranklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the\ndoor of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she\ncome in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising\nCain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for\nher. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two\nhours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they\nwarn\u2019t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\nI never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\n \nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\ncaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet\u2019s nest, but\nwe didn\u2019t. The family was at home. We didn\u2019t give it right up, but stayed with\nthem as long as we could; because we allowed we\u2019d tire them out or they\u2019d got\nto tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the\nplaces, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn\u2019t set down convenient.\nAnd so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and\nhouse-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time\nit was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day\u2019s work: and hungry?\u2014oh, no,\nI reckon not! And there warn\u2019t a blessed snake up there when we went back\u2014we\ndidn\u2019t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn\u2019t\nmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we\ncould get some of them again. No, there warn\u2019t no real scarcity of snakes about\nthe house for a considerable spell. You\u2019d see them dripping from the rafters\nand places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down\nthe back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn\u2019t want them. Well,\nthey was handsome and striped, and there warn\u2019t no harm in a million of them;\nbut that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the\nbreed what they might, and she couldn\u2019t stand them no way you could fix it; and\nevery time one of them flopped down on her, it didn\u2019t make no difference what\nshe was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see\nsuch a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn\u2019t get her to\ntake a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one\nin bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house\nwas afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there\nhadn\u2019t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone\nclear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn\u2019t over it yet; she\nwarn\u2019t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\ntouch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out\nof her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He\nsaid they was made that way for some reason or other.\n \nWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed\nthese lickings warn\u2019t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the\nplace again with them. I didn\u2019t mind the lickings, because they didn\u2019t amount\nto nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got\nthem laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome\nas Jim\u2019s was when they\u2019d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn\u2019t\nlike the spiders, and the spiders didn\u2019t like Jim; and so they\u2019d lay for him,\nand make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the\nsnakes and the grindstone there warn\u2019t no room in bed for him, skasely; and\nwhen there was, a body couldn\u2019t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always\nlively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn\nabout, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats\nturned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his\nway, and t\u2019other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new\nplace the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he\never got out this time he wouldn\u2019t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\n \nWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt\nwas sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and\nwrite a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the\ninscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed\nin two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing\nstomach-ache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn\u2019t. It was the most\nundigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same.\n \nBut as I was saying, we\u2019d got all the work done now, at last; and we was all\npretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of\ntimes to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but\nhadn\u2019t got no answer, because there warn\u2019t no such plantation; so he allowed he\nwould advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he\nmentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn\u2019t\nno time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s them?\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cWarnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it\u2019s done one way,\nsometimes another. But there\u2019s always somebody spying around that gives notice\nto the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the\nTooleries, a servant-girl done it. It\u2019s a very good way, and so is the\nnonnamous letters. We\u2019ll use them both. And it\u2019s usual for the prisoner\u2019s\nmother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her\nclothes. We\u2019ll do that, too.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for that\nsomething\u2019s up? Let them find it out for themselves\u2014it\u2019s their lookout.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I know; but you can\u2019t depend on them. It\u2019s the way they\u2019ve acted from the\nvery start\u2014left us to do everything. They\u2019re so confiding and\nmullet-headed they don\u2019t take notice of nothing at all. So if we don\u2019t\ngive them notice there won\u2019t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us,\nand so after all our hard work and trouble this escape \u2019ll go off perfectly\nflat; won\u2019t amount to nothing\u2014won\u2019t be nothing to it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, as for me, Tom, that\u2019s the way I\u2019d like.\u201d\n \n\u201cShucks!\u201d he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\n \n\u201cBut I ain\u2019t going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits me. What\nyou going to do about the servant-girl?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller\ngirl\u2019s frock.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Tom, that\u2019ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she prob\u2019bly\nhain\u2019t got any but that one.\u201d\n \n\u201cI know; but you don\u2019t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous\nletter and shove it under the front door.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, then, I\u2019ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own\ntogs.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t look like a servant-girl then, would you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, but there won\u2019t be nobody to see what I look like, anyway.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat ain\u2019t got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just to do our\nduty, and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not.\nHain\u2019t you got no principle at all?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, I ain\u2019t saying nothing; I\u2019m the servant-girl. Who\u2019s Jim\u2019s mother?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m his mother. I\u2019ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot much. I\u2019ll stuff Jim\u2019s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to\nrepresent his mother in disguise, and Jim \u2019ll take the nigger woman\u2019s gown off\nof me and wear it, and we\u2019ll all evade together. When a prisoner of style\nescapes it\u2019s called an evasion. It\u2019s always called so when a king escapes,\nf\u2019rinstance. And the same with a king\u2019s son; it don\u2019t make no difference\nwhether he\u2019s a natural one or an unnatural one.\u201d\n \nSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench\u2019s frock\nthat night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told\nme to. It said:\n \nBeware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. UNKNOWN\nFRIEND.\n \nNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and\ncrossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the\nback door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn\u2019t a been worse\nscared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything\nand under the beds and shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally\nshe jumped and said \u201couch!\u201d if anything fell, she jumped and said \u201couch!\u201d if\nyou happened to touch her, when she warn\u2019t noticing, she done the same; she\ncouldn\u2019t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something\nbehind her every time\u2014so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying\n\u201couch,\u201d and before she\u2019d got two-thirds around she\u2019d whirl back again, and say\nit again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn\u2019t set up. So the thing\nwas working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more\nsatisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\n \nSo he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the streak of\ndawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it,\nbecause we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at\nboth doors all night. Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the\nnigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and\ncome back. This letter said:\n \nDon\u2019t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of\ncutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger\nto-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the\nhouse and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and\nwish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish\ndesign. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight\nexact, with a false key, and go in the nigger\u2019s cabin to get him. I am to be\noff a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will\nBA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then\nwhilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and\ncan kill them at your leasure. Don\u2019t do anything but just the way I am telling\nyou, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do\nnot wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.\n \nUNKNOWN FRIEND\n",
        "\nWe was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the\nriver a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft\nand found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a\nsweat and worry they didn\u2019t know which end they was standing on, and made us go\nright off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn\u2019t tell us what the\ntrouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn\u2019t need to,\nbecause we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half\nup stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up\na good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about\nhalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally\u2019s dress that he stole and was going\nto start with the lunch, but says:\n \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the butter?\u201d\n \n\u201cI laid out a hunk of it,\u201d I says, \u201con a piece of a corn-pone.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you left it laid out, then\u2014it ain\u2019t here.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe can get along without it,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cWe can get along with it, too,\u201d he says; \u201cjust you slide down cellar\nand fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. I\u2019ll\ngo and stuff the straw into Jim\u2019s clothes to represent his mother in disguise,\nand be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.\u201d\n \nSo out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person\u2019s\nfist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on,\nand blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the\nmain floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped\nthe truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see\nme; and she says:\n \n\u201cYou been down cellar?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat you been doing down there?\u201d\n \n\u201cNoth\u2019n.\u201d\n \n\u201cNoth\u2019n!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2019m.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2019m.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know? Don\u2019t answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you\nbeen doing down there.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hain\u2019t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.\u201d\n \nI reckoned she\u2019d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I s\u2019pose\nthere was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every\nlittle thing that warn\u2019t yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:\n \n\u201cYou just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You been up\nto something you no business to, and I lay I\u2019ll find out what it is before\nI\u2019m done with you.\u201d\n \nSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but\nthere was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I\nwas most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting\naround, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety\nand uneasy, but trying to look like they warn\u2019t; but I knowed they was, because\nthey was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching\ntheir heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I\nwarn\u2019t easy myself, but I didn\u2019t take my hat off, all the same.\n \nI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she\nwanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we\u2019d overdone this thing, and\nwhat a thundering hornet\u2019s-nest we\u2019d got ourselves into, so we could stop\nfooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out\nof patience and come for us.\n \nAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I couldn\u2019t answer\nthem straight, I didn\u2019t know which end of me was up; because these men was in\nsuch a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for\nthem desperadoes, and saying it warn\u2019t but a few minutes to midnight; and\nothers was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and\nhere was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and\nready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter\nand hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my\nears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, \u201cI\u2019m for going and getting\nin the cabin first and right now, and catching them when they\ncome,\u201d I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my\nforehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:\n \n\u201cFor the land\u2019s sake, what is the matter with the child? He\u2019s got the\nbrain-fever as shore as you\u2019re born, and they\u2019re oozing out!\u201d\n \nAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread\nand what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:\n \n\u201cOh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain\u2019t no\nworse; for luck\u2019s against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see\nthat truck I thought we\u2019d lost you, for I knowed by the color and all it was\njust like your brains would be if\u2014Dear, dear, whyd\u2019nt you tell me that\nwas what you\u2019d been down there for, I wouldn\u2019t a cared. Now cler out to\nbed, and don\u2019t lemme see no more of you till morning!\u201d\n \nI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and\nshinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn\u2019t hardly get my words out,\nI was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now,\nand not a minute to lose\u2014the house full of men, yonder, with guns!\n \nHis eyes just blazed; and he says:\n \n\u201cNo!\u2014is that so? Ain\u2019t it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over again,\nI bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHurry! hurry!\u201d I says. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cRight at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He\u2019s\ndressed, and everything\u2019s ready. Now we\u2019ll slide out and give the\nsheep-signal.\u201d\n \nBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to\nfumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\n \n\u201cI told you we\u2019d be too soon; they haven\u2019t come\u2014the door is locked.\nHere, I\u2019ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for \u2019em in the dark and\nkill \u2019em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you\ncan hear \u2019em coming.\u201d\n \nSo in they come, but couldn\u2019t see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we\nwas hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all right, and out through\nthe hole, swift but soft\u2014Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according\nto Tom\u2019s orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by\noutside. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to\nthe crack, but couldn\u2019t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and\nsaid he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim\nmust glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and\nlistened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there\nall the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not\nbreathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the\nfence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom\u2019s\nbritches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps\ncoming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise;\nand as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:\n \n\u201cWho\u2019s that? Answer, or I\u2019ll shoot!\u201d\n \nBut we didn\u2019t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a\nrush, and a bang, bang, bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us!\nWe heard them sing out:\n \n\u201cHere they are! They\u2019ve broke for the river! After \u2019em, boys, and turn loose\nthe dogs!\u201d\n \nSo here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and\nyelled, but we didn\u2019t wear no boots and didn\u2019t yell. We was in the path to the\nmill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let\nthem go by, and then dropped in behind them. They\u2019d had all the dogs shut up,\nso they wouldn\u2019t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them\nloose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our\ndogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it\nwarn\u2019t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said\nhowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we\nup-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill,\nand then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in\nand pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn\u2019t make no\nmore noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable,\nfor the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at\neach other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim\nand died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:\n \n\u201cNow, old Jim, you\u2019re a free man again, and I bet you won\u2019t ever\nbe a slave no more.\u201d\n \n\u201cEn a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It \u2019uz planned beautiful, en it \u2019uz\ndone beautiful; en dey ain\u2019t nobody kin git up a plan dat\u2019s mo\u2019\nmixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\u201d\n \nWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had\na bullet in the calf of his leg.\n \nWhen me and Jim heard that we didn\u2019t feel so brash as what we did before. It\nwas hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and\ntore up one of the duke\u2019s shirts for to bandage him, but he says:\n \n\u201cGimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don\u2019t stop now; don\u2019t fool around here,\nand the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose!\nBoys, we done it elegant!\u2014\u2019deed we did. I wish we\u2019d a had the handling\nof Louis XVI., there wouldn\u2019t a been no \u2018Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!\u2019\nwrote down in his biography; no, sir, we\u2019d a whooped him over the\nborder\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019d a done with him\u2014and done it just as slick\nas nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps\u2014man the sweeps!\u201d\n \nBut me and Jim was consulting\u2014and thinking. And after we\u2019d thought a minute, I\nsays:\n \n\u201cSay it, Jim.\u201d\n \nSo he says:\n \n\u201cWell, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz him dat \u2019uz\nbein\u2019 sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, \u2018Go on en save\nme, nemmine \u2019bout a doctor f\u2019r to save dis one?\u2019 Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer?\nWould he say dat? You bet he wouldn\u2019t! Well, den, is Jim\ngywne to say it? No, sah\u2014I doan\u2019 budge a step out\u2019n dis place \u2019dout a\ndoctor; not if it\u2019s forty year!\u201d\n \nI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he\u2019d say what he did say\u2014so it was\nall right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor. He raised\nconsiderable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn\u2019t budge; so he\nwas for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn\u2019t let\nhim. Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn\u2019t do no good.\n \nSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\n \n\u201cWell, then, if you\u2019re bound to go, I\u2019ll tell you the way to do when you get to\nthe village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make\nhim swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand,\nand then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the\ndark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the\nislands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don\u2019t give it\nback to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this\nraft so he can find it again. It\u2019s the way they all do.\u201d\n \nSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the\ndoctor coming till he was gone again.\n",
        "\nThe doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up.\nI told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday\nafternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must\na kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we\nwanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let\nanybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the\nfolks.\n \n\u201cWho is your folks?\u201d he says.\n \n\u201cThe Phelpses, down yonder.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh,\u201d he says. And after a minute, he says:\n \n\u201cHow\u2019d you say he got shot?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe had a dream,\u201d I says, \u201cand it shot him.\u201d\n \n\u201cSingular dream,\u201d he says.\n \nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But when he\nsees the canoe he didn\u2019t like the look of her\u2014said she was big enough for one,\nbut didn\u2019t look pretty safe for two. I says:\n \n\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat three?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, me and Sid, and\u2014and\u2014and the guns; that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh,\u201d he says.\n \nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said\nhe reckoned he\u2019d look around for a bigger one. But they was all locked and\nchained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I\ncould hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready\nfor the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I didn\u2019t; so I told him just how to\nfind the raft, and then he started.\n \nI struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos\u2019n he can\u2019t fix that leg\njust in three shakes of a sheep\u2019s tail, as the saying is? spos\u2019n it takes him\nthree or four days? What are we going to do?\u2014lay around there till he lets the\ncat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll wait, and when he\ncomes back if he says he\u2019s got to go any more I\u2019ll get down there, too, if I\nswim; and we\u2019ll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river;\nand when Tom\u2019s done with him we\u2019ll give him what it\u2019s worth, or all we got, and\nthen let him get ashore.\n \nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up\nthe sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the doctor\u2019s house,\nbut they told me he\u2019d gone away in the night some time or other, and warn\u2019t\nback yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I\u2019ll dig out for\nthe island right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly\nrammed my head into Uncle Silas\u2019s stomach! He says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Tom! Where you been all this time, you rascal?\u201d\n \n\u201cI hain\u2019t been nowheres,\u201d I says, \u201conly just hunting for the runaway\nnigger\u2014me and Sid.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, where ever did you go?\u201d he says. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s been mighty uneasy.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe needn\u2019t,\u201d I says, \u201cbecause we was all right. We followed the men and the\ndogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the\nwater, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn\u2019t\nfind nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired\nand beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till\nabout an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid\u2019s at the\npost-office to see what he can hear, and I\u2019m a-branching out to get something\nto eat for us, and then we\u2019re going home.\u201d\n \nSo then we went to the post-office to get \u201cSid\u201d; but just as I suspicioned, he\nwarn\u2019t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited\na while longer, but Sid didn\u2019t come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid\nfoot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around\u2014but we would ride. I\ncouldn\u2019t get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn\u2019t no\nuse in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\n \nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both,\nand hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don\u2019t amount to\nshucks, and said she\u2019d serve Sid the same when he come.\n \nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers\u2019 wives, to dinner; and such\nanother clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue\nwas a-going all the time. She says:\n \n\u201cWell, Sister Phelps, I\u2019ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an\u2019 I b\u2019lieve the\nnigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell\u2014didn\u2019t I, Sister Damrell?\u2014s\u2019I, he\u2019s\ncrazy, s\u2019I\u2014them\u2019s the very words I said. You all hearn me: he\u2019s crazy, s\u2019I;\neverything shows it, s\u2019I. Look at that-air grindstone, s\u2019I; want to tell\nme\u2019t any cretur \u2019t\u2019s in his right mind \u2019s a goin\u2019 to scrabble all them\ncrazy things onto a grindstone, s\u2019I? Here sich \u2019n\u2019 sich a person busted his\nheart; \u2019n\u2019 here so \u2019n\u2019 so pegged along for thirty-seven year, \u2019n\u2019 all\nthat\u2014natcherl son o\u2019 Louis somebody, \u2019n\u2019 sich everlast\u2019n rubbage. He\u2019s plumb\ncrazy, s\u2019I; it\u2019s what I says in the fust place, it\u2019s what I says in the middle,\n\u2019n\u2019 it\u2019s what I says last \u2019n\u2019 all the time\u2014the nigger\u2019s crazy\u2014crazy \u2019s\nNebokoodneezer, s\u2019I.\u201d\n \n\u201cAn\u2019 look at that-air ladder made out\u2019n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,\u201d says old Mrs.\nDamrell; \u201cwhat in the name o\u2019 goodness could he ever want of\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThe very words I was a-sayin\u2019 no longer ago th\u2019n this minute to Sister\nUtterback, \u2019n\u2019 she\u2019ll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder,\nsh-she; \u2019n\u2019 s\u2019I, yes, look at it, s\u2019I\u2014what could he a-wanted of\nit, s\u2019I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut how in the nation\u2019d they ever git that grindstone in there,\nanyway? \u2019n\u2019 who dug that-air hole? \u2019n\u2019 who\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cMy very words, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin\u2019\u2014pass that-air sasser o\u2019\nm\u2019lasses, won\u2019t ye?\u2014I was a-sayin\u2019 to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how\ndid they git that grindstone in there, s\u2019I. Without help, mind\nyou\u2014\u2019thout help! Thar\u2019s wher \u2019tis. Don\u2019t tell me, s\u2019I;\nthere wuz help, s\u2019I; \u2019n\u2019 ther\u2019 wuz a plenty help, too, s\u2019I;\nther\u2019s ben a dozen a-helpin\u2019 that nigger, \u2019n\u2019 I lay I\u2019d skin every last\nnigger on this place but I\u2019d find out who done it, s\u2019I; \u2019n\u2019 moreover,\ns\u2019I\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cA dozen says you!\u2014forty couldn\u2019t a done every thing that\u2019s been\ndone. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they\u2019ve been made;\nlook at that bed-leg sawed off with \u2019m, a week\u2019s work for six men; look at that\nnigger made out\u2019n straw on the bed; and look at\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may well say it, Brer Hightower! It\u2019s jist as I was a-sayin\u2019 to\nBrer Phelps, his own self. S\u2019e, what do you think of it, Sister\nHotchkiss, s\u2019e? Think o\u2019 what, Brer Phelps, s\u2019I? Think o\u2019 that bed-leg sawed\noff that a way, s\u2019e? think of it, s\u2019I? I lay it never sawed\nitself off, s\u2019I\u2014somebody sawed it, s\u2019I; that\u2019s my opinion, take\nit or leave it, it mayn\u2019t be no \u2019count, s\u2019I, but sich as \u2019t is, it\u2019s my\nopinion, s\u2019I, \u2019n\u2019 if any body k\u2019n start a better one, s\u2019I, let him do\nit, s\u2019I, that\u2019s all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s\u2019I\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o\u2019 niggers in there every night\nfor four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. Look at that shirt\u2014every\nlast inch of it kivered over with secret African writ\u2019n done with blood! Must a\nben a raft uv \u2019m at it right along, all the time, amost. Why, I\u2019d give two\ndollars to have it read to me; \u2019n\u2019 as for the niggers that wrote it, I \u2019low I\u2019d\ntake \u2019n\u2019 lash \u2019m t\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cPeople to help him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you\u2019d think\nso if you\u2019d a been in this house for a while back. Why, they\u2019ve stole\neverything they could lay their hands on\u2014and we a-watching all the time, mind\nyou. They stole that shirt right off o\u2019 the line! and as for that sheet they\nmade the rag ladder out of, ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no telling how many times they\ndidn\u2019t steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons,\nand the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and\nmy new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch\nday and night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch\nhide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and\nbehold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only\nfools us but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets\naway with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and\ntwenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it\njust bangs anything I ever heard of. Why, sperits couldn\u2019t a done\nbetter and been no smarter. And I reckon they must a been\nsperits\u2014because, you know our dogs, and ther\u2019 ain\u2019t no better; well,\nthem dogs never even got on the track of \u2019m once! You explain\nthat to me if you can!\u2014any of you!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it does beat\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cLaws alive, I never\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cSo help me, I wouldn\u2019t a be\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHouse-thieves as well as\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cGoodnessgracioussakes, I\u2019d a ben afeard to live in sich a\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2019Fraid to live!\u2014why, I was that scared I dasn\u2019t hardly go to bed, or\nget up, or lay down, or set down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they\u2019d steal the\nvery\u2014why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in\nby the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn\u2019t afraid\nthey\u2019d steal some o\u2019 the family! I was just to that pass I didn\u2019t have no\nreasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough now, in the\ndaytime; but I says to myself, there\u2019s my two poor boys asleep, \u2019way up stairs\nin that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy \u2019t I crep\u2019\nup there and locked \u2019em in! I did. And anybody would. Because, you know,\nwhen you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and\nworse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all\nsorts o\u2019 wild things, and by-and-by you think to yourself, spos\u2019n I was\na boy, and was away up there, and the door ain\u2019t locked, and you\u2014\u201d She stopped,\nlooking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when\nher eye lit on me\u2014I got up and took a walk.\n \nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this\nmorning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So I done it. But I\ndasn\u2019t go fur, or she\u2019d a sent for me. And when it was late in the day the\npeople all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked\nup me and \u201cSid,\u201d and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we\nwent down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn\u2019t\nnever want to try that no more. And then I went on and told her all what\nI told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she\u2019d forgive us, and maybe it was\nall right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all\nboys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as\nno harm hadn\u2019t come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful\nwe was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was\npast and done. So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped\ninto a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:\n \n\u201cWhy, lawsamercy, it\u2019s most night, and Sid not come yet! What has become\nof that boy?\u201d\n \nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll run right up to town and get him,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cNo you won\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay right wher\u2019 you are; one\u2019s enough\nto be lost at a time. If he ain\u2019t here to supper, your uncle \u2019ll go.\u201d\n \nWell, he warn\u2019t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\n \nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn\u2019t run across Tom\u2019s track. Aunt\nSally was a good deal uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn\u2019t no\noccasion to be\u2014boys will be boys, he said, and you\u2019ll see this one turn up in\nthe morning all sound and right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said she\u2019d\nset up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.\n \nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and\ntucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn\u2019t look her\nin the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and\nsaid what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn\u2019t seem to want to ever stop talking\nabout him; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got\nlost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres\nsuffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip\ndown silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in\nthe morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me\nto say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was\nin so much trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so\nsteady and gentle, and says:\n \n\u201cThe door ain\u2019t going to be locked, Tom, and there\u2019s the window and the rod;\nbut you\u2019ll be good, won\u2019t you? And you won\u2019t go? For my sake.\u201d\n \nLaws knows I wanted to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all\nintending to go; but after that I wouldn\u2019t a went, not for kingdoms.\n \nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. And\ntwice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see\nher setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road\nand the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I\ncouldn\u2019t, only to swear that I wouldn\u2019t never do nothing to grieve her any\nmore. And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there\nyet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her\nhand, and she was asleep.\n",
        "\nThe old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn\u2019t get no track of\nTom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and\nlooking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And\nby-and-by the old man says:\n \n\u201cDid I give you the letter?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat letter?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t give me no letter.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I must a forgot it.\u201d\n \nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it\ndown, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\n \n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s from St. Petersburg\u2014it\u2019s from Sis.\u201d\n \nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\u2019t stir. But before she\ncould break it open she dropped it and run\u2014for she see something. And so did I.\nIt was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in her\ncalico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the\nletter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at\nTom, crying, and says:\n \n\u201cOh, he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead, I know he\u2019s dead!\u201d\n \nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which\nshowed he warn\u2019t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s alive, thank God! And that\u2019s enough!\u201d and she snatched a kiss of him, and\nflew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left\nat the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump\nof the way.\n \nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old\ndoctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men was very\nhuffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other\nniggers around there, so they wouldn\u2019t be trying to run away like Jim done, and\nmaking such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death\nfor days and nights. But the others said, don\u2019t do it, it wouldn\u2019t answer at\nall; he ain\u2019t our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him,\nsure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that\u2019s always the\nmost anxious for to hang a nigger that hain\u2019t done just right is always the\nvery ones that ain\u2019t the most anxious to pay for him when they\u2019ve got their\nsatisfaction out of him.\n \nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head\nonce in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me,\nand they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and\nchained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove\ninto the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he\nwarn\u2019t to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner\ncome, or he was sold at auction because he didn\u2019t come in a certain length of\ntime, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand\nwatch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the\ndaytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off\nwith a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes\na look, and says:\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t be no rougher on him than you\u2019re obleeged to, because he ain\u2019t a bad\nnigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\u2019t cut the bullet out\nwithout some help, and he warn\u2019t in no condition for me to leave to go and get\nhelp; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he\nwent out of his head, and wouldn\u2019t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if\nI chalked his raft he\u2019d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and\nI see I couldn\u2019t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have\nhelp somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from\nsomewheres and says he\u2019ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of\ncourse I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I was! and there\nI had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It\nwas a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of\ncourse I\u2019d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn\u2019t, because the\nnigger might get away, and then I\u2019d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come\nclose enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this\nmorning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and\nyet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see\nplain enough he\u2019d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I\ntell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars\u2014and kind\ntreatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there\nas he would a done at home\u2014better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I\nwas, with both of \u2019m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about\ndawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would\nhave it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees\nsound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and\ngrabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had\nno trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the\noars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the\nnigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain\u2019t no bad\nnigger, gentlemen; that\u2019s what I think about him.\u201d\n \nSomebody says:\n \n\u201cWell, it sounds very good, doctor, I\u2019m obleeged to say.\u201d\n \nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that\nold doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my\njudgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a\ngood man the first time I see him. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very\nwell, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. So every\none of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn\u2019t cuss him no\nmore.\n \nThen they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he could\nhave one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could\nhave meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn\u2019t think of it, and\nI reckoned it warn\u2019t best for me to mix in, but I judged I\u2019d get the doctor\u2019s\nyarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I\u2019d got through the breakers\nthat was laying just ahead of me\u2014explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to\nmention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that\ndratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.\n \nBut I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all\nnight, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.\n \nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was\ngone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I\nreckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was\nsleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he\nwas when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about half an hour\nAunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me\nto be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be\njoyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\u2019d been sleeping\nlike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time,\nand ten to one he\u2019d wake up in his right mind.\n \nSo we set there watching, and by-and-by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes\nvery natural, and takes a look, and says:\n \n\u201cHello!\u2014why, I\u2019m at home! How\u2019s that? Where\u2019s the raft?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I says.\n \n\u201cAnd Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe same,\u201d I says, but couldn\u2019t say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but\nsays:\n \n\u201cGood! Splendid! Now we\u2019re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\u201d\n \nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: \u201cAbout what, Sid?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, about the way the whole thing was done.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat whole thing?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, the whole thing. There ain\u2019t but one; how we set the runaway\nnigger free\u2014me and Tom.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood land! Set the run\u2014 What is the child talking about! Dear, dear, out\nof his head again!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I ain\u2019t out of my HEAD; I know all what I\u2019m talking\nabout. We did set him free\u2014me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we\ndone it. And we done it elegant, too.\u201d He\u2019d got a start, and she never\nchecked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I\nsee it warn\u2019t no use for me to put in. \u201cWhy, Aunty, it cost us a power\nof work\u2014weeks of it\u2014hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.\nAnd we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and\nspoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the\ngrindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can\u2019t think what work\nit was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another,\nand you can\u2019t think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the\npictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get\nup and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the\nrope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to\nwork with in your apron pocket\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cMercy sakes!\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2014and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim;\nand then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come\nnear spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the\ncabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my\nshare, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come\nthey warn\u2019t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our\ncanoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we\ndone it all by ourselves, and wasn\u2019t it bully, Aunty!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was you,\nyou little rapscallions, that\u2019s been making all this trouble, and turned\neverybody\u2019s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death. I\u2019ve as good\na notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o\u2019 you this very minute. To\nthink, here I\u2019ve been, night after night, a\u2014you just get well once, you\nyoung scamp, and I lay I\u2019ll tan the Old Harry out o\u2019 both o\u2019 ye!\u201d\n \nBut Tom, he was so proud and joyful, he just couldn\u2019t hold in,\nand his tongue just went it\u2014she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all\nalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:\n \n\u201cWell, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now, for mind\nI tell you if I catch you meddling with him again\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cMeddling with who?\u201d Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.\n \n\u201cWith who? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who\u2019d you reckon?\u201d\n \nTom looks at me very grave, and says:\n \n\u201cTom, didn\u2019t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn\u2019t he got away?\u201d\n \n\u201cHim?\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201cthe runaway nigger? \u2019Deed he hasn\u2019t. They\u2019ve\ngot him back, safe and sound, and he\u2019s in that cabin again, on bread and water,\nand loaded down with chains, till he\u2019s claimed or sold!\u201d\n \nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and\nshutting like gills, and sings out to me:\n \n\u201cThey hain\u2019t no right to shut him up! Shove!\u2014and don\u2019t you lose a\nminute. Turn him loose! he ain\u2019t no slave; he\u2019s as free as any cretur that\nwalks this earth!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat does the child mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cI mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\u2019t go,\nI\u2019ll go. I\u2019ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss\nWatson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him\ndown the river, and said so; and she set him free in her will.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen what on earth did you want to set him free for, seeing he was\nalready free?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, that is a question, I must say; and just like women! Why,\nI wanted the adventure of it; and I\u2019d a waded neck-deep in blood\nto\u2014goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!\u201d\n \nIf she warn\u2019t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and\ncontented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\n \nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over\nher, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting\npretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little\nwhile Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at\nTom over her spectacles\u2014kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then\nshe says:\n \n\u201cYes, you better turn y\u2019r head away\u2014I would if I was you, Tom.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, deary me!\u201d says Aunt Sally; \u201cis he changed so? Why, that ain\u2019t\nTom, it\u2019s Sid; Tom\u2019s\u2014Tom\u2019s\u2014why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou mean where\u2019s Huck Finn\u2014that\u2019s what you mean! I reckon I hain\u2019t\nraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I see\nhim. That would be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck\nFinn.\u201d\n \nSo I done it. But not feeling brash.\n \nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see\u2014except\none, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him. It\nkind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn\u2019t know nothing at all the\nrest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him\na rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn\u2019t a\nunderstood it. So Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and\nI had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took\nme for Tom Sawyer\u2014she chipped in and says, \u201cOh, go on and call me Aunt Sally,\nI\u2019m used to it now, and \u2019tain\u2019t no need to change\u201d\u2014that when Aunt Sally took me\nfor Tom Sawyer I had to stand it\u2014there warn\u2019t no other way, and I knowed he\nwouldn\u2019t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he\u2019d make\nan adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and\nhe let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.\n \nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim\nfree in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that\ntrouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn\u2019t ever understand\nbefore, until that minute and that talk, how he could help a body set a\nnigger free with his bringing-up.\n \nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\nSid had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\n \n\u201cLook at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way\nwithout anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down\nthe river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur\u2019s up to\nthis time; as long as I couldn\u2019t seem to get any answer out of you about\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I never heard nothing from you,\u201d says Aunt Sally.\n \n\u201cWell, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid\nbeing here.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I never got \u2019em, Sis.\u201d\n \nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\n \n\u201cYou, Tom!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell\u2014what?\u201d he says, kind of pettish.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you what me, you impudent thing\u2014hand out them letters.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat letters?\u201d\n \n\u201cThem letters. I be bound, if I have to take aholt of you I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re in the trunk. There, now. And they\u2019re just the same as they was when I\ngot them out of the office. I hain\u2019t looked into them, I hain\u2019t touched them.\nBut I knowed they\u2019d make trouble, and I thought if you warn\u2019t in no hurry,\nI\u2019d\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you do need skinning, there ain\u2019t no mistake about it. And I\nwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\u2019pose he\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, it come yesterday; I hain\u2019t read it yet, but it\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve\ngot that one.\u201d\n \nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\u2019t, but I reckoned maybe it was\njust as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.\n",
        "\nThe first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the\nevasion?\u2014what it was he\u2019d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he\nmanaged to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he\nhad planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us\nto run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth\nof the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home\non a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead\nand get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a\ntorchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so\nwould we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.\n \nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas\nand Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a\nheap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to\neat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room,\nand had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us\nso patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and\nbusted out, and says:\n \n\u201cDah, now, Huck, what I tell you?\u2014what I tell you up dah on Jackson\nislan\u2019? I tole you I got a hairy breas\u2019, en what\u2019s de sign un it; en I\ntole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich agin; en it\u2019s\ncome true; en heah she is! Dah, now! doan\u2019 talk to me\u2014signs is\nsigns, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\u2019 \u2019s well \u2019at I \u2019uz gwineter be\nrich agin as I\u2019s a-stannin\u2019 heah dis minute!\u201d\n \nAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\u2019s all three slide\nout of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling\nadventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or\ntwo; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain\u2019t got no money for to buy\nthe outfit, and I reckon I couldn\u2019t get none from home, because it\u2019s likely\npap\u2019s been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk\nit up.\n \n\u201cNo, he hain\u2019t,\u201d Tom says; \u201cit\u2019s all there yet\u2014six thousand dollars and more;\nand your pap hain\u2019t ever been back since. Hadn\u2019t when I come away, anyhow.\u201d\n \nJim says, kind of solemn:\n \n\u201cHe ain\u2019t a-comin\u2019 back no mo\u2019, Huck.\u201d\n \nI says:\n \n\u201cWhy, Jim?\u201d\n \n\u201cNemmine why, Huck\u2014but he ain\u2019t comin\u2019 back no mo.\u201d\n \nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:\n \n\u201cDoan\u2019 you \u2019member de house dat was float\u2019n down de river, en dey wuz a man in\ndah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\u2019 let you come in? Well,\nden, you kin git yo\u2019 money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him.\u201d\n \nTom\u2019s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a\nwatch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain\u2019t nothing more to\nwrite about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I\u2019d a knowed what a trouble\nit was to make a book I wouldn\u2019t a tackled it, and ain\u2019t a-going to no more.\nBut I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because\nAunt Sally she\u2019s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can\u2019t stand it. I\nbeen there before.\n \nTHE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN.\n"

He remembered pushing, with a big leather pad on his forehead,\nat a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was before the Afghan War of 1842, and he\nhad not then come to his full strength.\n \nHis mother Radha Pyari,\u2014Radha the darling,\u2014who had been caught in the same\ndrive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had dropped out,\nthat elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew that that advice\nwas good, for the first time that he saw a shell burst he backed, screaming,\ninto a stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets pricked him in all his softest\nplaces. So, before he was twenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was\nthe best-loved and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the\nGovernment of India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds\u2019 weight of\ntents, on the march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end\nof a steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a\nmortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India, and had\nseen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had come back again in the\nsteamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He had\nseen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke\nup at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; and afterward he had been\nsent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the\ntimberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed an insubordinate young\nelephant who was shirking his fair share of work.\n Kala Nag was the best-loved elephant in the service. \nAfter that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few score\nother elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to catch wild\nelephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly preserved by the\nIndian Government. There is one whole department which does nothing else but\nhunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and send them up and down the\ncountry as they are needed for work.\n \nKala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been cut off\nshort at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them splitting, with\nbands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained\nelephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When, after weeks and weeks of\ncautious driving of scattered elephants across the hills, the forty or fifty\nwild monsters were driven into the last stockade, and the big drop gate, made\nof tree trunks lashed together, jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word\nof command, would go into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at\nnight, when the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances),\nand, picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer him\nand hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other elephants\nroped and tied the smaller ones.\n \nThere was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise Black\nSnake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his time to the\ncharge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk to be out of harm\u2019s\nway, had knocked the springing brute sideways in mid-air with a quick sickle\ncut of his head, that he had invented all by himself; had knocked him over, and\nkneeled upon him with his huge knees till the life went out with a gasp and a\nhowl, and there was only a fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to\npull by the tail.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had taken him\nto Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had seen him caught,\n\u201cthere is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me. He has seen three\ngenerations of us feed him and groom him, and he will live to see four.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is afraid of me also,\u201d said Little Toomai, standing up to his full height\nof four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old, the eldest son\nof Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take his father\u2019s place on\nKala Nag\u2019s neck when he grew up, and would handle the heavy iron ankus, the\nelephant goad, that had been worn smooth by his father, and his grandfather,\nand his great-grandfather.\n Kala Nag \nHe knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nag\u2019s shadow,\nhad played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had taken him down\nto water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no more have dreamed of\ndisobeying his shrill little orders than he would have dreamed of killing him\non that day when Big Toomai carried the little brown baby under Kala Nag\u2019s\ntusks, and told him to salute his master that was to be.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Little Toomai, \u201che is afraid of me,\u201d and he took long strides up to\nKala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up his feet one after the\nother.\n \n\u201cWah!\u201d said Little Toomai, \u201cthou art a big elephant,\u201d and he wagged his fluffy\nhead, quoting his father. \u201cThe Government may pay for elephants, but they\nbelong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will come some rich\nrajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on account of thy size and thy\nmanners, and then thou wilt have nothing to do but to carry gold earrings in\nthy ears, and a gold howdah on thy back, and a red cloth covered with gold on\nthy sides, and walk at the head of the processions of the King. Then I shall\nsit on thy neck, O Kala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us\nwith golden sticks, crying, `Room for the King\u2019s elephant!\u2019 That will be good,\nKala Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.\u201d\n \n\u201cUmph!\u201d said Big Toomai. \u201cThou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf. This\nrunning up and down among the hills is not the best Government service. I am\ngetting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me brick elephant lines,\none stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie them to safely, and flat,\nbroad roads to exercise upon, instead of this come-and-go camping. Aha, the\nCawnpore barracks were good. There was a bazaar close by, and only three hours\u2019\nwork a day.\u201d\n \nLittle Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing. He very\nmuch preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads, with the daily\ngrubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long hours when there was\nnothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in his pickets.\n \nWhat Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an elephant\ncould take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the wild elephants\nbrowsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and peacock under Kala\nNag\u2019s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the hills and valleys smoked; the\nbeautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night; the\nsteady, cautious drive of the wild elephants, and the mad rush and blaze and\nhullabaloo of the last night\u2019s drive, when the elephants poured into the\nstockade like boulders in a landslide, found that they could not get out, and\nflung themselves at the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring\ntorches and volleys of blank cartridge.\n \nEven a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as three\nboys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the best. But the\nreally good time came when the driving out began, and the Keddah\u2014that is, the\nstockade\u2014looked like a picture of the end of the world, and men had to make\nsigns to one another, because they could not hear themselves speak. Then Little\nToomai would climb up to the top of one of the quivering stockade posts, his\nsun-bleached brown hair flying loose all over his shoulders, and he looking\nlike a goblin in the torch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could\nhear his high-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting\nand crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered elephants.\n\u201cMael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do! (Give him the\ntusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit him, hit him!) Mind\nthe post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!\u201d he would shout, and the big fight\nbetween Kala Nag and the wild elephant would sway to and fro across the Keddah,\nand the old elephant catchers would wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find\ntime to nod to Little Toomai wriggling with joy on the top of the posts.\n \nHe did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and slipped in\nbetween the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope, which had dropped,\nto a driver who was trying to get a purchase on the leg of a kicking young calf\n(calves always give more trouble than full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him,\ncaught him in his trunk, and handed him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then\nand there, and put him back on the post.\n \nNext morning he gave him a scolding and said, \u201cAre not good brick elephant\nlines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs go elephant\ncatching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those foolish hunters, whose\npay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen Sahib of the matter.\u201d Little\nToomai was frightened. He did not know much of white men, but Petersen Sahib\nwas the greatest white man in the world to him. He was the head of all the\nKeddah operations\u2014the man who caught all the elephants for the Government of\nIndia, and who knew more about the ways of elephants than any living man.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2014what will happen?\u201d said Little Toomai.\n \n\u201cHappen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why should\nhe go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be an elephant\ncatcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles, and at last to be\ntrampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this nonsense ends safely.\nNext week the catching is over, and we of the plains are sent back to our\nstations. Then we will march on smooth roads, and forget all this hunting. But,\nson, I am angry that thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these\ndirty Assamese jungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with\nhim into the Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help\nto rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,\u2014not a mere hunter,\u2014a\nmahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of his service. Is the\nfamily of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of a\nKeddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son! Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to\nhis ears, and see that there are no thorns in his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib\nwill surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter\u2014a follower of elephant\u2019s\nfoot tracks, a jungle bear. Bah! Shame! Go!\u201d\n \nLittle Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all his\ngrievances while he was examining his feet. \u201cNo matter,\u201d said Little Toomai,\nturning up the fringe of Kala Nag\u2019s huge right ear. \u201cThey have said my name to\nPetersen Sahib, and perhaps\u2014and perhaps\u2014and perhaps\u2014who knows? Hai! That is a\nbig thorn that I have pulled out!\u201d\n \nThe next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in walking the\nnewly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones to\nprevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains, and\nin taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or\nlost in the forest.\n \nPetersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been paying\noff other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an end, and there\nwas a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to pay the drivers their\nwages. As each man was paid he went back to his elephant, and joined the line\nthat stood ready to start. The catchers, and hunters, and beaters, the men of\nthe regular Keddah, who stayed in the jungle year in and year out, sat on the\nbacks of the elephants that belonged to Petersen Sahib\u2019s permanent force, or\nleaned against the trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the\ndrivers who were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke\nthe line and ran about.\n \nBig Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and Machua Appa,\nthe head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his, \u201cThere goes one\npiece of good elephant stuff at least. \u2019Tis a pity to send that young\njungle-cock to molt in the plains.\u201d\n \nNow Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens to the\nmost silent of all living things\u2014the wild elephant. He turned where he was\nlying all along on Pudmini\u2019s back and said, \u201cWhat is that? I did not know of a\nman among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope even a dead elephant.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last drive, and\nthrew Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that young calf with\nthe blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.\u201d\n \nMachua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and Little\nToomai bowed to the earth.\n \n\u201cHe throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is thy\nname?\u201d said Petersen Sahib.\n \nLittle Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him, and\nToomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in his trunk\nand held him level with Pudmini\u2019s forehead, in front of the great Petersen\nSahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his hands, for he was only a\nchild, and except where elephants were concerned, he was just as bashful as a\nchild could be.\n \n\u201cOho!\u201d said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, \u201cand why didst\nthou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green corn from\nthe roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?\u201d\n \u201cNot green corn, Protector of the Poor,\u2014melons,\u201d said Little\nToomai. \n\u201cNot green corn, Protector of the Poor,\u2014melons,\u201d said Little Toomai, and all\nthe men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of them had taught\ntheir elephants that trick when they were boys. Little Toomai was hanging eight\nfeet up in the air, and he wished very much that he were eight feet\nunderground.\n \n\u201cHe is Toomai, my son, Sahib,\u201d said Big Toomai, scowling. \u201cHe is a very bad\nboy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf that I have my doubts,\u201d said Petersen Sahib. \u201cA boy who can face a full\nKeddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are four annas\nto spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under that great thatch\nof hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too.\u201d Big Toomai scowled more than\never. \u201cRemember, though, that Keddahs are not good for children to play in,\u201d\nPetersen Sahib went on.\n \n\u201cMust I never go there, Sahib?\u201d asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d Petersen Sahib smiled again. \u201cWhen thou hast seen the elephants dance.\nThat is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the elephants dance,\nand then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.\u201d\n \nThere was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among\nelephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat places\nhidden away in the forests that are called elephants\u2019 ball-rooms, but even\nthese are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the elephants dance.\nWhen a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other drivers say, \u201cAnd when\ndidst thou see the elephants dance?\u201d\n \nKala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and went away\nwith his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his mother, who was\nnursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on Kala Nag\u2019s back, and the\nline of grunting, squealing elephants rolled down the hill path to the plains.\nIt was a very lively march on account of the new elephants, who gave trouble at\nevery ford, and needed coaxing or beating every other minute.\n \nBig Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but Little\nToomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him, and given him\nmoney, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he had been called out of\nthe ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.\n \n\u201cWhat did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?\u201d he said, at last, softly\nto his mother.\n \nBig Toomai heard him and grunted. \u201cThat thou shouldst never be one of these\nhill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in front, what is\nblocking the way?\u201d\n \nAn Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily, crying:\n\u201cBring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good behavior. Why\nshould Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you donkeys of the rice\nfields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and let him prod with his tusks. By\nall the Gods of the Hills, these new elephants are possessed, or else they can\nsmell their companions in the jungle.\u201d Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the\nribs and knocked the wind out of him, as Big Toomai said, \u201cWe have swept the\nhills of wild elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in\ndriving. Must I keep order along the whole line?\u201d\n \n\u201cHear him!\u201d said the other driver. \u201cWe have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You are\nvery wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw the jungle\nwould know that they know that the drives are ended for the season. Therefore\nall the wild elephants to-night will\u2014but why should I waste wisdom on a\nriver-turtle?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat will they do?\u201d Little Toomai called out.\n \n\u201cOhe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a cool\nhead. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has swept all the hills\nof all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets to-night.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat talk is this?\u201d said Big Toomai. \u201cFor forty years, father and son, we have\ntended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about dances.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls of his hut.\nWell, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what comes. As for their\ndancing, I have seen the place where\u2014Bapree-bap! How many windings has the\nDihang River? Here is another ford, and we must swim the calves. Stop still,\nyou behind there.\u201d\n \nAnd in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers, they\nmade their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new elephants. But\nthey lost their tempers long before they got there.\n \nThen the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps of\npickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the fodder was\npiled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen Sahib through the\nafternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be extra careful that night, and\nlaughing when the plains drivers asked the reason.\n \nLittle Toomai attended to Kala Nag\u2019s supper, and as evening fell, wandered\nthrough the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom. When an Indian\nchild\u2019s heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular\nfashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little Toomai had\nbeen spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he had not found what he wanted, I believe\nhe would have been ill. But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little\ntom-tom\u2014a drum beaten with the flat of the hand\u2014and he sat down, cross-legged,\nbefore Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he\nthumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the great\nhonor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone among the\nelephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the thumping made him\nhappy.\n \nThe new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted from time\nto time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his small brother\nto sleep with an old, old song about the great God Shiv, who once told all the\nanimals what they should eat. It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first\nverse says:\n \nShiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,\nSitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,\nGave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,\nFrom the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All things made he\u2014Shiva the Preserver.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all\u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And mother\u2019s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!\n \nLittle Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse, till\nhe felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala Nag\u2019s side. At last\nthe elephants began to lie down one after another as is their custom, till only\nKala Nag at the right of the line was left standing up; and he rocked slowly\nfrom side to side, his ears put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew\nvery slowly across the hills. The air was full of all the night noises that,\ntaken together, make one big silence\u2014the click of one bamboo stem against the\nother, the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk\nof a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than we\nimagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept for some\ntime, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was still\nstanding up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling in the fodder,\nand watched the curve of his big back against half the stars in heaven, and\nwhile he watched he heard, so far away that it sounded no more than a pinhole\nof noise pricked through the stillness, the \u201choot-toot\u201d of a wild elephant.\n \nAll the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and their\ngrunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and drove in the\npicket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and knotted that till all\nwas quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket, and Big Toomai\ntook off Kala Nag\u2019s leg chain and shackled that elephant fore-foot to\nhind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string round Kala Nag\u2019s leg, and told\nhim to remember that he was tied fast. He knew that he and his father and his\ngrandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did\nnot answer to the order by gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking\nout across the moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like\nfans, up to the great folds of the Garo hills.\n \n\u201cTend to him if he grows restless in the night,\u201d said Big Toomai to Little\nToomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was just going to\nsleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a little \u201ctang,\u201d and Kala\nNag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of\nthe mouth of a valley. Little Toomai pattered after him, barefooted, down the\nroad in the moonlight, calling under his breath, \u201cKala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me\nwith you, O Kala Nag!\u201d The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides\nback to the boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck,\nand almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the forest.\n \nThere was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the silence\nshut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes a tuft of high\ngrass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides of a ship, and\nsometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, or a\nbamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it. But between those times he\nmoved absolutely without any sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as\nthough it had been smoke. He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched\nthe stars in the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction.\n \nThen Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute, and\nLittle Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and furry\nunder the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist over the river\nin the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he felt that the forest\nwas awake below him\u2014awake and alive and crowded. A big brown fruit-eating bat\nbrushed past his ear; a porcupine\u2019s quills rattled in the thicket; and in the\ndarkness between the tree stems he heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist\nwarm earth, and snuffing as it digged.\n \nThen the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go down\ninto the valley\u2014not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes down a steep\nbank\u2014in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as pistons, eight feet to\neach stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow points rustled. The undergrowth\non either side of him ripped with a noise like torn canvas, and the saplings\nthat he heaved away right and left with his shoulders sprang back again and\nbanged him on the flank, and great trails of creepers, all matted together,\nhung from his tusks as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his\npathway. Then Little Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a\nswinging bough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back\nin the lines again.\n \nThe grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag\u2019s feet sucked and squelched as he\nput them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley chilled Little\nToomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of running water, and\nKala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling his way at each step. Above\nthe noise of the water, as it swirled round the elephant\u2019s legs, Little Toomai\ncould hear more splashing and some trumpeting both upstream and down\u2014great\ngrunts and angry snortings, and all the mist about him seemed to be full of\nrolling, wavy shadows.\n \n\u201cAi!\u201d he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. \u201cThe elephant-folk are out\ntonight. It is the dance, then!\u201d\n \nKala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began another\nclimb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make his path. That\nwas made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where the bent jungle-grass\nwas trying to recover itself and stand up. Many elephants must have gone that\nway only a few minutes before. Little Toomai looked back, and behind him a\ngreat wild tusker with his little pig\u2019s eyes glowing like hot coals was just\nlifting himself out of the misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and\nthey went on and up, with trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking\nbranches on every side of them.\n Elephant-dance \nAt last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top of the\nhill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an irregular space of\nsome three or four acres, and in all that space, as Little Toomai could see,\nthe ground had been trampled down as hard as a brick floor. Some trees grew in\nthe center of the clearing, but their bark was rubbed away, and the white wood\nbeneath showed all shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight. There were\ncreepers hanging from the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the\ncreepers, great waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep.\nBut within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of\ngreen\u2014nothing but the trampled earth.\n \nThe moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants stood upon\nit, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding his\nbreath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he looked, more and more\nand more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks. Little\nToomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and again on his\nfingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the\nclearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their\nway up the hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree\ntrunks they moved like ghosts.\n \nThere were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying\nin the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat, slow-footed\nshe-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only three or four feet\nhigh running under their stomachs; young elephants with their tusks just\nbeginning to show, and very proud of them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants,\nwith their hollow anxious faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull\nelephants, scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone\nfights, and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their\nshoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the\nfull-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger\u2019s claws on his side.\n \nThey were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground in\ncouples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves\u2014scores and scores of\nelephants.\n \nToomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag\u2019s neck nothing would\nhappen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild\nelephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame\nelephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men that night. Once they\nstarted and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a leg iron\nin the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib\u2019s pet elephant, her chain\nsnapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. She must have broken\nher pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahib\u2019s camp; and Little Toomai saw\nanother elephant, one that he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back\nand breast. He, too, must have run away from some camp in the hills about.\n \nAt last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala\nNag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of\nthe crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to talk in their\nown tongue, and to move about.\n Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad\nbacks. \nStill lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad\nbacks, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling eyes. He heard\nthe click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident, and the dry rustle\nof trunks twined together, and the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in\nthe crowd, and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud\ncame over the moon, and he sat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady\nhustling and pushing and gurgling went on just the same. He knew that there\nwere elephants all round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him\nout of the assembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least\nthere was torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and\nonce a trunk came up and touched him on the knee.\n \nThen an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten terrible\nseconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen\nbacks, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and Little\nToomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up\none forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground\u2014one-two,\none-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together\nnow, and it sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell\nfrom the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on,\nand the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his\nears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through\nhim\u2014this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. Once or twice he\ncould feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the\nthumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being\nbruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again. A\ntree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt\nthe bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell\nwhere he was in the clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except\nonce, when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump\nand a shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours,\nand Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the night\nair that the dawn was coming.\n \nThe morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills, and the\nbooming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had been an order.\nBefore Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head, before even he had\nshifted his position, there was not an elephant in sight except Kala Nag,\nPudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls, and there was neither sign nor\nrustle nor whisper down the hillsides to show where the others had gone.\n \nLittle Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it, had\ngrown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the undergrowth\nand the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back. Little Toomai stared\nonce more. Now he understood the trampling. The elephants had stamped out more\nroom\u2014had stamped the thick grass and juicy cane to trash, the trash into\nslivers, the slivers into tiny fibers, and the fibers into hard earth.\n \n\u201cWah!\u201d said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. \u201cKala Nag, my lord,\nlet us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib\u2019s camp, or I shall drop from\nthy neck.\u201d\n \nThe third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and took\nhis own path. He may have belonged to some little native king\u2019s establishment,\nfifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.\n \nTwo hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his elephants,\nwho had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and Pudmini, mired to\nthe shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled into the camp. Little\nToomai\u2019s face was gray and pinched, and his hair was full of leaves and\ndrenched with dew, but he tried to salute Petersen Sahib, and cried faintly:\n\u201cThe dance\u2014the elephant dance! I have seen it, and\u2014I die!\u201d As Kala Nag sat\ndown, he slid off his neck in a dead faint.\n \nBut, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two hours he\nwas lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib\u2019s hammock with Petersen Sahib\u2019s\nshooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk, a little brandy, with a\ndash of quinine, inside of him, and while the old hairy, scarred hunters of the\njungles sat three deep before him, looking at him as though he were a spirit,\nhe told his tale in short words, as a child will, and wound up with:\n \n\u201cNow, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the\nelephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and they will\nfind ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that dance-room. They\nmade more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala Nag took me, and I saw.\nAlso Kala Nag is very leg-weary!\u201d\n \nLittle Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into the\ntwilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed the track\nof the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills. Petersen Sahib had\nspent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had only once before found\nsuch a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need to look twice at the clearing to\nsee what had been done there, or to scratch with his toe in the packed, rammed\nearth.\n \n\u201cThe child speaks truth,\u201d said he. \u201cAll this was done last night, and I have\ncounted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where Pudmini\u2019s leg-iron\ncut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.\u201d\n \nThey looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the ways of\nelephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to fathom.\n \n\u201cForty years and five,\u201d said Machua Appa, \u201chave I followed my lord, the\nelephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what this child\nhas seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is\u2014what can we say?\u201d and he shook\nhis head.\n \nWhen they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen Sahib ate\nalone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep and\nsome fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and rice and salt, for he knew\nthat there would be a feast.\n Toomai of the elephants \nBig Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for his\nson and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at them as\nthough he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by the blazing\ncampfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants, and Little Toomai was\nthe hero of it all. And the big brown elephant catchers, the trackers and\ndrivers and ropers, and the men who know all the secrets of breaking the\nwildest elephants, passed him from one to the other, and they marked his\nforehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed jungle-cock, to show that\nhe was a forester, initiated and free of all the jungles.\n \nAnd at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs made the\nelephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too, Machua Appa, the\nhead of all the drivers of all the Keddahs\u2014Machua Appa, Petersen Sahib\u2019s other\nself, who had never seen a made road in forty years: Machua Appa, who was so\ngreat that he had no other name than Machua Appa,\u2014leaped to his feet, with\nLittle Toomai held high in the air above his head, and shouted: \u201cListen, my\nbrothers. Listen, too, you my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am\nspeaking! This little one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of\nthe Elephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never man\nhas seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the elephant-folk\nand of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall become a great tracker. He\nshall become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow the new\ntrail, and the stale trail, and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall\ntake no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild\ntuskers; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the\nbull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my lords in\nthe chains,\u201d\u2014he whirled up the line of pickets\u2014\u201chere is the little one that has\nseen your dances in your hidden places,\u2014the sight that never man saw! Give him\nhonor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your salute to Toomai of the\nElephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa!\nPudmini,\u2014thou hast seen him at the dance, and thou too, Kala Nag, my pearl\namong elephants!\u2014ahaa! Together! To Toomai of the Elephants. Barrao!\u201d\n To Toomai of the elephants. Barrao! \nAnd at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the tips\ntouched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute\u2014the crashing\ntrumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut of the Keddah.\n \nBut it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never man had\nseen before\u2014the dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the\nGaro hills!\n",

        "\nYou can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,\nBut the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.\nYou can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,\nBut the way of Pilly Winky\u2019s not the way of Winkie Pop!\n \nIt had been raining heavily for one whole month\u2014raining on a camp of thirty\nthousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, and mules\nall gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the\nViceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan\u2014a wild\nking of a very wild country. The Amir had brought with him for a bodyguard\neight hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp or a locomotive before\nin their lives\u2014savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of\nCentral Asia. Every night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their\nheel ropes and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or\nthe camels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the\ntents, and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.\nMy tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe. But one\nnight a man popped his head in and shouted, \u201cGet out, quick! They\u2019re coming! My\ntent\u2019s gone!\u201d\n \nI knew who \u201cthey\u201d were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out\ninto the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the other side;\nand then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent\ncave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance about like a mad ghost. A\ncamel had blundered into it, and wet and angry as I was, I could not help\nlaughing. Then I ran on, because I did not know how many camels might have got\nloose, and before long I was out of sight of the camp, plowing my way through\nthe mud.\n A camel had blundered into my tent. \nAt last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was somewhere\nnear the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at night. As I did not\nwant to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark, I put my waterproof\nover the muzzle of one gun, and made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers\nthat I found, and lay along the tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had\ngot to, and where I might be.\n \nJust as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a\ngrunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun\nbattery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and\nthings on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two\npieces, that are screwed together when the time comes to use them. They are\ntaken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very\nuseful for fighting in rocky country.\n \nBehind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching and\nslipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen\u2019s.\nLuckily, I knew enough of beast language\u2014not wild-beast language, but\ncamp-beast language, of course\u2014from the natives to know what he was saying.\n \nHe must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to the mule,\n\u201cWhat shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white thing that\nwaved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.\u201d (That was my broken tent\npole, and I was very glad to know it.) \u201cShall we run on?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, it was you,\u201d said the mule, \u201cyou and your friends, that have been\ndisturbing the camp? All right. You\u2019ll be beaten for this in the morning. But I\nmay as well give you something on account now.\u201d\n \nI heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel two kicks in\nthe ribs that rang like a drum. \u201cAnother time,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll know better\nthan to run through a mule battery at night, shouting `Thieves and fire!\u2019 Sit\ndown, and keep your silly neck quiet.\u201d\n \nThe camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down\nwhimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big\ntroop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped a gun\ntail, and landed close to the mule.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d he said, blowing out his nostrils. \u201cThose camels have\nracketed through our lines again\u2014the third time this week. How\u2019s a horse to\nkeep his condition if he isn\u2019t allowed to sleep. Who\u2019s here?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw Battery,\u201d said\nthe mule, \u201cand the other\u2019s one of your friends. He\u2019s waked me up too. Who are\nyou?\u201d\n \n\u201cNumber Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers\u2014Dick Cunliffe\u2019s horse. Stand over a\nlittle, there.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, beg your pardon,\u201d said the mule. \u201cIt\u2019s too dark to see much. Aren\u2019t these\ncamels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get a little\npeace and quiet here.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy lords,\u201d said the camel humbly, \u201cwe dreamed bad dreams in the night, and we\nwere very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry,\nand I am not as brave as you are, my lords.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry,\ninstead of running all round the camp?\u201d said the mule.\n \n\u201cThey were such very bad dreams,\u201d said the camel. \u201cI am sorry. Listen! What is\nthat? Shall we run on again?\u201d\n \n\u201cSit down,\u201d said the mule, \u201cor you\u2019ll snap your long stick-legs between the\nguns.\u201d He cocked one ear and listened. \u201cBullocks!\u201d he said. \u201cGun bullocks. On\nmy word, you and your friends have waked the camp very thoroughly. It takes a\ngood deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.\u201d\n \nI heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky white\nbullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won\u2019t go any nearer\nto the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the\nchain was another battery mule, calling wildly for \u201cBilly.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our recruits,\u201d said the old mule to the troop horse. \u201cHe\u2019s\ncalling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never hurt anybody\nyet.\u201d\n \nThe gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the young\nmule huddled close to Billy.\n \n\u201cThings!\u201d he said. \u201cFearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our lines while\nwe were asleep. D\u2019you think they\u2019ll kill us?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,\u201d said Billy. \u201cThe\nidea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the battery before\nthis gentleman!\u201d\n \n\u201cGently, gently!\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cRemember they are always like this to\nbegin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia when I was a\nthree-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I\u2019d seen a camel, I should have\nbeen running still.\u201d\n \nNearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from\nAustralia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.\n \n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d said Billy. \u201cStop shaking, youngster. The first time they put\nthe full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs and\nkicked every bit of it off. I hadn\u2019t learned the real science of kicking then,\nbut the battery said they had never seen anything like it.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t harness or anything that jingled,\u201d said the young mule. \u201cYou\nknow I don\u2019t mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and they fell up\nand down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldn\u2019t find my\ndriver, and I couldn\u2019t find you, Billy, so I ran off with\u2014with these\ngentlemen.\u201d\n \n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Billy. \u201cAs soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away on my\nown account. When a battery\u2014a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he\nmust be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the ground there?\u201d\n \nThe gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: \u201cThe seventh\nyoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep when the camels\ncame, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked away. It is better to\nlie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good bedding. We told your friend\nhere that there was nothing to be afraid of, but he knew so much that he\nthought otherwise. Wah!\u201d\n \nThey went on chewing.\n \n\u201cThat comes of being afraid,\u201d said Billy. \u201cYou get laughed at by gun-bullocks.\nI hope you like it, young un.\u201d\n \nThe young mule\u2019s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not being\nafraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks only clicked\ntheir horns together and went on chewing.\n \u201cAnybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night,\u201d\nsaid the troop-horse \n\u201cNow, don\u2019t be angry after you\u2019ve been afraid. That\u2019s the worst kind of\ncowardice,\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cAnybody can be forgiven for being scared in\nthe night, I think, if they see things they don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve broken out\nof our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a\nnew recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia till we\nwere scared to death of the loose ends of our head-ropes.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well in camp,\u201d said Billy. \u201cI\u2019m not above stampeding myself,\nfor the fun of the thing, when I haven\u2019t been out for a day or two. But what do\nyou do on active service?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, that\u2019s quite another set of new shoes,\u201d said the troop horse. \u201cDick\nCunliffe\u2019s on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have to do\nis to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs well under me,\nand be bridle-wise.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s bridle-wise?\u201d said the young mule.\n \n\u201cBy the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,\u201d snorted the troop-horse, \u201cdo you mean to\nsay that you aren\u2019t taught to be bridle-wise in your business? How can you do\nanything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your\nneck? It means life or death to your man, and of course that\u2019s life and death\nto you. Get round with your hind legs under you the instant you feel the rein\non your neck. If you haven\u2019t room to swing round, rear up a little and come\nround on your hind legs. That\u2019s being bridle-wise.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe aren\u2019t taught that way,\u201d said Billy the mule stiffly. \u201cWe\u2019re taught to obey\nthe man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when he says so. I\nsuppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this fine fancy business and\nrearing, which must be very bad for your hocks, what do you do?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat depends,\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cGenerally I have to go in among a lot of\nyelling, hairy men with knives\u2014long shiny knives, worse than the farrier\u2019s\nknives\u2014and I have to take care that Dick\u2019s boot is just touching the next man\u2019s\nboot without crushing it. I can see Dick\u2019s lance to the right of my right eye,\nand I know I\u2019m safe. I shouldn\u2019t care to be the man or horse that stood up to\nDick and me when we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t the knives hurt?\u201d said the young mule.\n \n\u201cWell, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn\u2019t Dick\u2019s fault\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cA lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!\u201d said the young\nmule.\n \n\u201cYou must,\u201d said the troop horse. \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust your man, you may as well\nrun away at once. That\u2019s what some of our horses do, and I don\u2019t blame them. As\nI was saying, it wasn\u2019t Dick\u2019s fault. The man was lying on the ground, and I\nstretched myself not to tread on him, and he slashed up at me. Next time I have\nto go over a man lying down I shall step on him\u2014hard.\u201d\n The man was lying on the ground, and I stretched myself not\nto tread on him, and he slashed up at me. \n\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d said Billy. \u201cIt sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things at any\ntime. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced\nsaddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and creep and crawl and\nwriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge\nwhere there\u2019s just room enough for your hoofs. Then you stand still and keep\nquiet\u2014never ask a man to hold your head, young un\u2014keep quiet while the guns are\nbeing put together, and then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into\nthe tree-tops ever so far below.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever trip?\u201d said the troop-horse.\n \n\u201cThey say that when a mule trips you can split a hen\u2019s ear,\u201d said Billy. \u201cNow\nand again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it\u2019s very\nseldom. I wish I could show you our business. It\u2019s beautiful. Why, it took me\nthree years to find out what the men were driving at. The science of the thing\nis never to show up against the sky line, because, if you do, you may get fired\nat. Remember that, young un. Always keep hidden as much as possible, even if\nyou have to go a mile out of your way. I lead the battery when it comes to that\nsort of climbing.\u201d\n \n\u201cFired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!\u201d said\nthe troop-horse, thinking hard. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand that. I should want to\ncharge\u2014with Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no, you wouldn\u2019t. You know that as soon as the guns are in position\nthey\u2019ll do all the charging. That\u2019s scientific and neat. But knives\u2014pah!\u201d\n \nThe baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time past,\nanxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he cleared his\nthroat, nervously:\n \n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that running way.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. Now you mention it,\u201d said Billy, \u201cyou don\u2019t look as though you were made\nfor climbing or running\u2014much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe proper way,\u201d said the camel. \u201cWe all sat down\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, my crupper and breastplate!\u201d said the troop-horse under his breath. \u201cSat\ndown!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe sat down\u2014a hundred of us,\u201d the camel went on, \u201cin a big square, and the men\npiled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired over our backs,\nthe men did, on all sides of the square.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat sort of men? Any men that came along?\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cThey teach\nus in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across us, but Dick\nCunliffe is the only man I\u2019d trust to do that. It tickles my girths, and,\nbesides, I can\u2019t see with my head on the ground.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat does it matter who fires across you?\u201d said the camel. \u201cThere are plenty\nof men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many clouds of smoke. I\nam not frightened then. I sit still and wait.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said Billy, \u201cyou dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night. Well,\nwell! Before I\u2019d lie down, not to speak of sitting down, and let a man fire\nacross me, my heels and his head would have something to say to each other. Did\nyou ever hear anything so awful as that?\u201d\n \nThere was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his big\nhead and said, \u201cThis is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of\nfighting.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, go on,\u201d said Billy. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mind me. I suppose you fellows fight\nstanding on your tails?\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly one way,\u201d said the two together. (They must have been twins.) \u201cThis is\nthat way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon as Two Tails\ntrumpets.\u201d (\u201cTwo Tails\u201d is camp slang for the elephant.)\n \n\u201cWhat does Two Tails trumpet for?\u201d said the young mule.\n \n\u201cTo show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other side. Two\nTails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all together\u2014Heya\u2014Hullah!\nHeeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor run like calves. We go across the\nlevel plain, twenty yoke of us, till we are unyoked again, and we graze while\nthe big guns talk across the plain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of\nthe wall fall out, and the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming\nhome.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! And you choose that time for grazing?\u201d said the young mule.\n \n\u201cThat time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked up\nagain and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it. Sometimes\nthere are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of us are killed, and\nthen there is all the more grazing for those that are left. This is Fate. None\nthe less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is the proper way to fight. We are\nbrothers from Hapur. Our father was a sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve certainly learned something tonight,\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cDo you\ngentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you are being\nfired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?\u201d\n \n\u201cAbout as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all over us,\nor run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A mountain ledge, a\nwell-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you pick your own way, and\nI\u2019m your mule. But\u2014the other things\u2014no!\u201d said Billy, with a stamp of his foot.\n \n\u201cOf course,\u201d said the troop horse, \u201ceveryone is not made in the same way, and I\ncan quite see that your family, on your father\u2019s side, would fail to understand\na great many things.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever you mind my family on my father\u2019s side,\u201d said Billy angrily, for every\nmule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. \u201cMy father was a\nSouthern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every\nhorse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!\u201d\n \nBrumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of Sunol if\na car-horse called her a \u201cskate,\u201d and you can imagine how the Australian horse\nfelt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.\n \n\u201cSee here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,\u201d he said between his teeth,\n\u201cI\u2019d have you know that I\u2019m related on my mother\u2019s side to Carbine, winner of\nthe Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren\u2019t accustomed to being ridden\nover roughshod by any parrot-mouthed, pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter\nbattery. Are you ready?\u201d\n \n\u201cOn your hind legs!\u201d squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each other, and\nI was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the\ndarkness to the right\u2014\u201cChildren, what are you fighting about there? Be quiet.\u201d\n \nBoth beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor mule\ncan bear to listen to an elephant\u2019s voice.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s Two Tails!\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cI can\u2019t stand him. A tail at each end\nisn\u2019t fair!\u201d\n \n\u201cMy feelings exactly,\u201d said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for company.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very alike in some things.\u201d\n \n\u201cI suppose we\u2019ve inherited them from our mothers,\u201d said the troop horse. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. \u201cI\u2019m picketed for the\nnight. I\u2019ve heard what you fellows have been saying. But don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m\nnot coming over.\u201d\n \nThe bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, \u201cAfraid of Two Tails\u2014what\nnonsense!\u201d And the bullocks went on, \u201cWe are sorry that you heard, but it is\ntrue. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly like a\nlittle boy saying a poem, \u201cI don\u2019t quite know whether you\u2019d understand.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t, but we have to pull the guns,\u201d said the bullocks.\n \n\u201cI know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think you are. But\nit\u2019s different with me. My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous\nAnachronism the other day.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s another way of fighting, I suppose?\u201d said Billy, who was recovering his\nspirits.\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and\nbetween, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what will happen\nwhen a shell bursts, and you bullocks can\u2019t.\u201d\n \n\u201cI can,\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cAt least a little bit. I try not to think about\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cI can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there\u2019s a great deal\nof me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to cure me when I\u2019m\nsick. All they can do is to stop my driver\u2019s pay till I get well, and I can\u2019t\ntrust my driver.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d said the troop horse. \u201cThat explains it. I can trust Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me feel any\nbetter. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in\nspite of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe do not understand,\u201d said the bullocks.\n \n\u201cI know you don\u2019t. I\u2019m not talking to you. You don\u2019t know what blood is.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe do,\u201d said the bullocks. \u201cIt is red stuff that soaks into the ground and\nsmells.\u201d\n \nThe troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t talk of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can smell it now, just thinking of it. It makes\nme want to run\u2014when I haven\u2019t Dick on my back.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut it is not here,\u201d said the camel and the bullocks. \u201cWhy are you so stupid?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s vile stuff,\u201d said Billy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run, but I don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere you are!\u201d said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.\n \n\u201cSurely. Yes, we have been here all night,\u201d said the bullocks.\n \nTwo Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not\ntalking to you. You can\u2019t see inside your heads.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. We see out of our four eyes,\u201d said the bullocks. \u201cWe see straight in front\nof us.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn\u2019t be needed to pull the big\nguns at all. If I was like my captain\u2014he can see things inside his head before\nthe firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too much to run away\u2014if\nI was like him I could pull the guns. But if I were as wise as all that I\nshould never be here. I should be a king in the forest, as I used to be,\nsleeping half the day and bathing when I liked. I haven\u2019t had a good bath for a\nmonth.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s all very fine,\u201d said Billy. \u201cBut giving a thing a long name doesn\u2019t\nmake it any better.\u201d\n \n\u201cH\u2019sh!\u201d said the troop horse. \u201cI think I understand what Two Tails means.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand better in a minute,\u201d said Two Tails angrily. \u201cNow you just\nexplain to me why you don\u2019t like this!\u201d\n \nHe began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.\n \n\u201cStop that!\u201d said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could hear them\nstamp and shiver. An elephant\u2019s trumpeting is always nasty, especially on a\ndark night.\n \n\u201cI shan\u2019t stop,\u201d said Two Tails. \u201cWon\u2019t you explain that, please? Hhrrmph!\nRrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!\u201d Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard a little whimper\nin the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last. She knew as well as I\ndid that if there is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of than\nanother it is a little barking dog. So she stopped to bully Two Tails in his\npickets, and yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. \u201cGo\naway, little dog!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t snuff at my ankles, or I\u2019ll kick at you.\nGood little dog\u2014nice little doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast!\nOh, why doesn\u2019t someone take her away? She\u2019ll bite me in a minute.\u201d\n \n\u201cSeems to me,\u201d said Billy to the troop horse, \u201cthat our friend Two Tails is\nafraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I\u2019ve kicked\nacross the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.\u201d\n \nI whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose, and\ntold me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I never let her\nknow that I understood beast talk, or she would have taken all sorts of\nliberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my overcoat, and Two Tails\nshuffled and stamped and growled to himself.\n \n\u201cExtraordinary! Most extraordinary!\u201d he said. \u201cIt runs in our family. Now,\nwhere has that nasty little beast gone to?\u201d\n \nI heard him feeling about with his trunk.\n \n\u201cWe all seem to be affected in various ways,\u201d he went on, blowing his nose.\n\u201cNow, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot alarmed, exactly,\u201d said the troop-horse, \u201cbut it made me feel as though I\nhad hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don\u2019t begin again.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad dreams\nin the night.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is very lucky for us that we haven\u2019t all got to fight in the same way,\u201d\nsaid the troop-horse.\n \n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d said the young mule, who had been quiet for a long\ntime\u2014\u201cwhat I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause we\u2019re told to,\u201d said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.\n \n\u201cOrders,\u201d said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.\n \n\u201cHukm hai!\u201d (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two Tails and\nthe bullocks repeated, \u201cHukm hai!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, but who gives the orders?\u201d said the recruit-mule.\n \n\u201cThe man who walks at your head\u2014Or sits on your back\u2014Or holds the nose rope\u2014Or\ntwists your tail,\u201d said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel and the\nbullocks one after the other.\n \n\u201cBut who gives them the orders?\u201d\n \n\u201cNow you want to know too much, young un,\u201d said Billy, \u201cand that is one way of\ngetting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your head and ask no\nquestions.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s quite right,\u201d said Two Tails. \u201cI can\u2019t always obey, because I\u2019m betwixt\nand between. But Billy\u2019s right. Obey the man next to you who gives the order,\nor you\u2019ll stop all the battery, besides getting a thrashing.\u201d\n \nThe gun-bullocks got up to go. \u201cMorning is coming,\u201d they said. \u201cWe will go back\nto our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and we are not very\nclever. But still, we are the only people to-night who have not been afraid.\nGood-night, you brave people.\u201d\n \nNobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation, \u201cWhere\u2019s\nthat little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.\u201d\n \n\u201cHere I am,\u201d yapped Vixen, \u201cunder the gun tail with my man. You big, blundering\nbeast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man\u2019s very angry.\u201d\n \n\u201cPhew!\u201d said the bullocks. \u201cHe must be white!\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course he is,\u201d said Vixen. \u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m looked after by a black\nbullock-driver?\u201d\n \n\u201cHuah! Ouach! Ugh!\u201d said the bullocks. \u201cLet us get away quickly.\u201d\n \nThey plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke on the\npole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.\n \n\u201cNow you have done it,\u201d said Billy calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t struggle. You\u2019re hung up till\ndaylight. What on earth\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \nThe bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle give, and\npushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in\nthe mud, grunting savagely.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll break your necks in a minute,\u201d said the troop-horse. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\nwith white men? I live with \u2019em.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey\u2014eat\u2014us! Pull!\u201d said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a twang, and\nthey lumbered off together.\n \nI never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen. We eat\nbeef\u2014a thing that no cattle-driver touches\u2014and of course the cattle do not like\nit.\n \n\u201cMay I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who\u2019d have thought of two big lumps\nlike those losing their heads?\u201d said Billy.\n \n\u201cNever mind. I\u2019m going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I know, have\nthings in their pockets,\u201d said the troop-horse.\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you, then. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m over-fond of \u2019em myself. Besides, white\nmen who haven\u2019t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be thieves, and\nI\u2019ve a good deal of Government property on my back. Come along, young un, and\nwe\u2019ll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia! See you on parade to-morrow,\nI suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!\u2014try to control your feelings, won\u2019t you?\nGood-night, Two Tails! If you pass us on the ground tomorrow, don\u2019t trumpet. It\nspoils our formation.\u201d\n \nBilly the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old campaigner, as\nthe troop-horse\u2019s head came nuzzling into my breast, and I gave him biscuits,\nwhile Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog, told him fibs about the scores\nof horses that she and I kept.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere will you\nbe?\u201d\n \n\u201cOn the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my troop,\nlittle lady,\u201d he said politely. \u201cNow I must go back to Dick. My tail\u2019s all\nmuddy, and he\u2019ll have two hours\u2019 hard work dressing me for parade.\u201d\n \nThe big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon, and\nVixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan,\nwith high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the\ncenter. The first part of the review was all sunshine, and the regiments went\nby in wave upon wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in a line, till\nour eyes grew dizzy. Then the cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter\nof \u201cBonnie Dundee,\u201d and Vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The\nsecond squadron of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his\ntail like spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one\nback, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly as\nwaltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two other\nelephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while twenty yoke of\noxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and they looked rather\nstiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself\nas though he commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and polished\ntill it winked. I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule, but he never\nlooked right or left.\n \nThe rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see what the\ntroops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the plain, and were\nspreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and grew till it was\nthree-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing\u2014one solid wall of men, horses,\nand guns. Then it came on straight toward the Viceroy and the Amir, and as it\ngot nearer the ground began to shake, like the deck of a steamer when the\nengines are going fast.\n \nUnless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect this\nsteady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they know it is\nonly a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not shown the shadow\nof a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his eyes began to get\nbigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his horse\u2019s neck and looked\nbehind him. For a minute it seemed as though he were going to draw his sword\nand slash his way out through the English men and women in the carriages at the\nback. Then the advance stopped dead, the ground stood still, the whole line\nsaluted, and thirty bands began to play all together. That was the end of the\nreview, and the regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry\nband struck up with\u2014\n \nThe animals went in two by two,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hurrah!\nThe animals went in two by two,\nThe elephant and the battery mul\u2019,\nand they all got into the Ark\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For to get out of the rain!\n \nThen I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had come\ndown with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cin what manner was this wonderful thing done?\u201d\n \nAnd the officer answered, \u201cAn order was given, and they obeyed.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut are the beasts as wise as the men?\u201d said the chief.\n \n\u201cThey obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he obeys his\ndriver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his lieutenant, and the\nlieutenant his captain, and the captain his major, and the major his colonel,\nand the colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier the\ngeneral, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is\ndone.\u201d\n \n\u201cWould it were so in Afghanistan!\u201d said the chief, \u201cfor there we obey only our\nown wills.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd for that reason,\u201d said the native officer, twirling his mustache, \u201cyour\nAmir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our Viceroy.\u201d\n",

        "\nI resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly\nstrengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain\nof me.

Not a hint, however, did\nshe drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that\nshe would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now\nmore than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted\naversion.",
        "\nFive o\u2019clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when\nBessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly\ndressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face,\nand put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays\nstreamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that\nday by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six A.M. Bessie\nwas the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now\nproceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the\nthoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a\nfew spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up\nsome biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with\nmy pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the\nnursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed\u2019s bedroom, she said, \u201cWill you go in and bid\nMissis good-bye?",
        "\nThe next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but\nthis morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the\nwater in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the\npreceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices\nof our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and\nturned the contents of the ewers to ice.\n \nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt\nready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the\nporridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small\nmy portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.\n \nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and\nregular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a\nspectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein.\nAt first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me\nboth long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered\nme; and I was glad when, about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put\ninto my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble,\n&c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with\ndirections to hem the same. At that hour most of the others were sewing\nlikewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd\u2019s chair reading, and\nas all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with\nthe manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or\ncommendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English history:\namong the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the\ncommencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for\nsome error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly\nsent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd\ncontinued to make her an object of constant notice: she was continually\naddressing to her such phrases as the following:\u2014\n \n\u201cBurns\u201d (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their\nsurnames, as boys are elsewhere), \u201cBurns, you are standing on the side of your\nshoe; turn your toes out immediately.\u201d \u201cBurns, you poke your chin most\nunpleasantly; draw it in.\u201d \u201cBurns, I insist on your holding your head up; I\nwill not have you before me in that attitude,\u201d &c. &c.\n \nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls\nexamined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I., and there\nwere sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of\nthem appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved\ninstantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the\nsubstance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I\nkept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of\nthat, she suddenly cried out\u2014\n \n\u201cYou dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this morning!\u201d\n \nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\n \n\u201cWhy,\u201d thought I, \u201cdoes she not explain that she could neither clean her nails\nnor wash her face, as the water was frozen?\u201d\n \nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of\nthread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking\nwhether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit,\n&c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss\nScatcherd\u2019s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just\ndelivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately\nleft the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept,\nreturned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together\nat one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful\ncurtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and\nthe teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with\nthe bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns\u2019 eye; and, while I paused from my\nsewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of\nunavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its\nordinary expression.\n \n\u201cHardened girl!\u201d exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; \u201cnothing can correct you of your\nslatternly habits: carry the rod away.\u201d\n \nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she\nwas just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear\nglistened on her thin cheek.\n \nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at\nLowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o\u2019clock had\nrevived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day\nwas slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning\u2014its fires being\nallowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place\nof candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the\nconfusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.\n \nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil,\nBurns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups\nwithout a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now\nand then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already\nforming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could\ndistinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind\noutside.\n \nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have\nbeen the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that\nwind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed\nmy peace! as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and\nfeverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to\ndarkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.\n \nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the\nfire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed,\nsilent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she\nread by the dim glare of the embers.\n \n\u201cIs it still \u2018Rasselas\u2019?\u201d I asked, coming behind her.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have just finished it.\u201d\n \nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d thought I, \u201cI can perhaps get her to talk.\u201d I sat down by her on the\nfloor.\n \n\u201cWhat is your name besides Burns?\u201d\n \n\u201cHelen.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you come a long way from here?\u201d\n \n\u201cI come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.\u201d\n \n\u201cWill you ever go back?\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou must wish to leave Lowood?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of\nno use going away until I have attained that object.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?\u201d\n \n\u201cCruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her. If she\nstruck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should break it under\nher nose.\u201d\n \n\u201cProbably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst\nwould expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations.\nIt is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself,\nthan to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all\nconnected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the\nmiddle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far\nyounger than you, and I could not bear it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak\nand silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to\nbear.\u201d\n \nI heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and\nstill less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed\nfor her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light\ninvisible to my eyes. I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I would\nnot ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient\nseason.\n \n\u201cYou say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said,\nslatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in order; I am careless; I\nforget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and\nsometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be subjected to systematic\narrangements. This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally\nneat, punctual, and particular.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd cross and cruel,\u201d I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition:\nshe kept silence.\n \n\u201cIs Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?\u201d\n \nAt the utterance of Miss Temple\u2019s name, a soft smile flitted over her grave\nface.\n \n\u201cMiss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even\nthe worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and,\nif I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally. One strong\nproof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so\nmild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her\npraise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care\nand foresight.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is curious,\u201d said I, \u201cit is so easy to be careful.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor you I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this\nmorning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to\nwander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine\ncontinually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and\ncollecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her\nvoice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland,\nand that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which\nruns through Deepden, near our house;\u2014then, when it comes to my turn to reply,\nI have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening\nto the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet how well you replied this afternoon.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested\nme. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man\nwho wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First\nsometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and\nconscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown.\nIf he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the\nspirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles\u2014I respect him\u2014I pity him,\npoor murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had\nno right to shed. How dared they kill him!\u201d\n \nHelen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well\nunderstand her\u2014that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she discussed.\nI recalled her to my level.\n \n\u201cAnd when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say\nwhich is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to\nme, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, with Miss Temple you are good?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides me.\nThere is no merit in such goodness.\u201d\n \n\u201cA great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever\ndesire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel\nand unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never\nfeel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.\nWhen we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard;\nI am sure we should\u2014so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it\nagain.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a\nlittle untaught girl.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please\nthem, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly. It\nis as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to\npunishment when I feel it is deserved.\u201d\n \n\u201cHeathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised\nnations disown it.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not violence that best overcomes hate\u2014nor vengeance that most certainly\nheals injury.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n \n\u201cRead the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make\nHis word your rule, and His conduct your example.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat does He say?\u201d\n \n\u201cLove your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you\nand despitefully use you.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John,\nwhich is impossible.\u201d\n \nIn her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour\nout, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and\ntruculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.\n \nHelen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a remark,\nbut she said nothing.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I asked impatiently, \u201cis not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?\u201d\n \n\u201cShe has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your cast\nof character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all\nshe has done and said to you! What a singularly deep impression her injustice\nseems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my\nfeelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity,\ntogether with the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short\nto be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be,\none and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come\nwhen, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies;\nwhen debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,\nand only the spark of the spirit will remain,\u2014the impalpable principle of light\nand thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence\nit came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher\nthan man\u2014perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul\nto brighten to the seraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered\nto degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another\ncreed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I\ndelight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a\nrest\u2014a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can\nso clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely\nforgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries\nmy heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me\ntoo low: I live in calm, looking to the end.\u201d\n \nHelen\u2019s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this\nsentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to\nconverse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time for meditation: a\nmonitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong\nCumberland accent\u2014\n \n\u201cHelen Burns, if you don\u2019t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your\nwork this minute, I\u2019ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!\u201d\n \nHelen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor without\nreply as without delay.\n",
        "\nMy first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it\ncomprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new\nrules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse\nthan the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.\n \nDuring January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their\nmelting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden\nwalls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour\nevery day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the\nsevere cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our\nungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I\nremember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every\nevening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,\nand stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was\ndistressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely\nsufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of\nnourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils:\nwhenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace\nthe little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between two\nclaimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after\nrelinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have\nswallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me\nby the exigency of hunger.\n \nSundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two miles to\nBrocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived\nat church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed. It was\ntoo far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the\nsame penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round\nbetween the services.\n \nAt the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road,\nwhere the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the\nnorth, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\n \nI can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line,\nher plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and\nencouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march\nforward, as she said, \u201clike stalwart soldiers.\u201d The other teachers, poor\nthings, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of\ncheering others.\n \nHow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! But,\nto the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was\nimmediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the\nyounger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their\npinafores.\n \nA little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread\u2014a\nwhole, instead of a half, slice\u2014with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of\nbutter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath\nto Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast\nfor myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.\n \nThe Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and\nthe fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a\nlong sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her\nweariness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the\npart of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with\nsleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form,\nand be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\ncentre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was\nfinished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap;\nthey were then propped up with the monitors\u2019 high stools.\n \nI have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that\ngentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my\narrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon: his\nabsence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for\ndreading his coming: but come he did at last.\n \nOne afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a\nslate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in\nabstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised\nalmost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the\nschool, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to\nlook up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride\nmeasured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had\nrisen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from\nthe hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of\narchitecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a\nsurtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\n \nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I\nremembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,\n&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the\nteachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of\nthis promise,\u2014I had been looking out daily for the \u201cComing Man,\u201d whose\ninformation respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad\nchild for ever: now there he was.\n \nHe stood at Miss Temple\u2019s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt\nhe was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful\nanxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of\nrepugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite\nat the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me\nfrom immediate apprehension.\n \n\u201cI suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me\nthat it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the\nneedles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of\nthe darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she\nis not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if\nthey have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma\u2019am! I wish\nthe woollen stockings were better looked to!\u2014when I was here last, I went into\nthe kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a\nquantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the\nholes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time.\u201d\n \nHe paused.\n \n\u201cYour directions shall be attended to, sir,\u201d said Miss Temple.\n \n\u201cAnd, ma\u2019am,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe laundress tells me some of the girls have two\nclean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine Johnstone\nwere invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave\nthem leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.\u201d\n \nMr. Brocklehurst nodded.\n \n\u201cWell, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too\noften. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling\naccounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese,\nhas twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight. How is this?\nI looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who\nintroduced this innovation? and by what authority?\u201d\n \n\u201cI must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,\u201d replied Miss Temple: \u201cthe\nbreakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I\ndared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.\u201d\n \n\u201cMadam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up these\ngirls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to\nrender them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental\ndisappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under\nor the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by\nreplacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the\nbody and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the\nspiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude\nunder the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be\nmistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of\nreferring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of\nmartyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His\ndisciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall\nnot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of\nGod; to His divine consolations, \u2018If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake,\nhappy are ye.\u2019 Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt\nporridge, into these children\u2019s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies,\nbut you little think how you starve their immortal souls!\u201d\n \nMr. Brocklehurst again paused\u2014perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss Temple had\nlooked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight\nbefore her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming\nalso the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as\nif it would have required a sculptor\u2019s chisel to open it, and her brow settled\ngradually into petrified severity.\n \nMeantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his\nback, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as\nif it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he\nsaid in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used\u2014\n \n\u201cMiss Temple, Miss Temple, what\u2014what is that girl with curled hair? Red\nhair, ma\u2019am, curled\u2014curled all over?\u201d And extending his cane he pointed to the\nawful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\n \n\u201cIt is Julia Severn,\u201d replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\n \n\u201cJulia Severn, ma\u2019am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why, in\ndefiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the\nworld so openly\u2014here in an evangelical, charitable establishment\u2014as to wear her\nhair one mass of curls?\u201d\n \n\u201cJulia\u2019s hair curls naturally,\u201d returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.\n \n\u201cNaturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be\nthe children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again and again intimated\nthat I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Temple,\nthat girl\u2019s hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and\nI see others who have far too much of the excrescence\u2014that tall girl, tell her\nto turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the\nwall.\u201d\n \nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the\ninvoluntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the\nfirst class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a\nlittle back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they\ncommented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them\ntoo; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of\nthe cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he\nimagined.\n \nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then\npronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom\u2014\n \n\u201cAll those top-knots must be cut off.\u201d\n \nMiss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\n \n\u201cMadam,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this\nworld: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach\nthem to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided\nhair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string\nof hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I\nrepeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of\u2014\u201d\n \nMr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now\nentered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his\nlecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.\nThe two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey\nbeaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the\nbrim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately\ncurled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with\nermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.\n \nThese ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses\nBrocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems\nthey had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been\nconducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted\nbusiness with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the\nsuperintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to\nMiss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of\nthe dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters\ncalled off and enchanted my attention.\n \nHitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple,\nI had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal\nsafety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.\nTo this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with\nmy sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have\nescaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my\nhand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I\nknew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of\nslate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.\n \n\u201cA careless girl!\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after\u2014\u201cIt is the new\npupil, I perceive.\u201d And before I could draw breath, \u201cI must not forget I have a\nword to say respecting her.\u201d Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me! \u201cLet the\nchild who broke her slate come forward!\u201d\n \nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great\ngirls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the\ndread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I\ncaught her whispered counsel\u2014\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.\u201d\n \nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\n \n\u201cAnother minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,\u201d thought I; and an\nimpulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the\nconviction. I was no Helen Burns.\n \n\u201cFetch that stool,\u201d said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from\nwhich a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\n \n\u201cPlace the child upon it.\u201d\n \nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don\u2019t know: I was in no condition to note\nparticulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr.\nBrocklehurst\u2019s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot\norange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and\nwaved below me.\n \nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\n \n\u201cLadies,\u201d said he, turning to his family, \u201cMiss Temple, teachers, and children,\nyou all see this girl?\u201d\n \nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against\nmy scorched skin.\n \n\u201cYou see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of\nchildhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of\nus; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think\nthat the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I\ngrieve to say, is the case.\u201d\n \nA pause\u2014in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the\nRubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly\nsustained.\n \n\u201cMy dear children,\u201d pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, \u201cthis is a\nsad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl,\nwho might be one of God\u2019s own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the\ntrue flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard\nagainst her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company,\nexclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers,\nyou must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words,\nscrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such\nsalvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this\nchild, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who\nsays its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut\u2014this girl is\u2014a liar!\u201d\n \nNow came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect\npossession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their\npocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady\nswayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, \u201cHow shocking!\u201d\n \nMr. Brocklehurst resumed.\n \n\u201cThis I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who\nadopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose\nkindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so\ndreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from\nher own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their\npurity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their\ndiseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg\nof you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.\u201d\n \nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his\nsurtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and\nthen all the great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the door,\nmy judge said\u2014\n \n\u201cLet her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her\nduring the remainder of the day.\u201d\n \nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of\nstanding on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to\ngeneral view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were, no language can\ndescribe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my\nthroat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a\nstrange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent\nthrough me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had\npassed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the\nrising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen\nBurns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for\nthe triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she\nagain went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the\neffluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments,\nher thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an\nangel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm \u201cthe untidy badge;\u201d\nscarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of\nbread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it\nout. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of\nthe clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd\u2019s can only see those minute\ndefects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.\n",
        "\nEre the half-hour ended, five o\u2019clock struck; school was dismissed, and all\nwere gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep\ndusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I\nhad been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so\noverwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the\nground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to\nmyself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be\nso good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect\nand win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had\nreached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple\nhad smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me\nlearn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and\nthen I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of\nmy own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden\non; and could I ever rise more?\n \n\u201cNever,\u201d I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out this wish\nin broken accents, some one approached: I started up\u2014again Helen Burns was near\nme; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant room; she\nbrought my coffee and bread.\n \n\u201cCome, eat something,\u201d she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a\ndrop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition. Helen regarded\nme, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried\nhard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced\nher knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she\nremained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke\u2014\n \n\u201cHelen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?\u201d\n \n\u201cEverybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called\nso, and the world contains hundreds of millions.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what have I to do with millions? The eighty I know despise me.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or\ndislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is\nlittle liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had he treated\nyou as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert,\nall around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they\ndared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but\nfriendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing\nwell, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their\ntemporary suppression. Besides, Jane\u201d\u2014she paused.\n \n\u201cWell, Helen?\u201d said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently\nto warm them, and went on\u2014\n \n\u201cIf all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience\napproved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others\ndon\u2019t love me I would rather die than live\u2014I cannot bear to be solitary and\nhated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple,\nor any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my\narm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and\nlet it dash its hoof at my chest\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too\nimpulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put\nlife into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or\nthan creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men,\nthere is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us,\nfor it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to\nguard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all\nsides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence\n(if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has\nweakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a\nsincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only\nthe separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then,\nshould we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and\ndeath is so certain an entrance to happiness\u2014to glory?\u201d\n \nI was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted there\nwas an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she\nspoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she\nbreathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own\nsorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\n \nResting my head on Helen\u2019s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she drew me\nto her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus, when another\nperson came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had\nleft the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone\nfull both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as\nMiss Temple.\n \n\u201cI came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,\u201d said she; \u201cI want you in my room;\nand as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.\u201d\n \nWe went; following the superintendent\u2019s guidance, we had to thread some\nintricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it\ncontained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be\nseated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking\nanother, she called me to her side.\n \n\u201cIs it all over?\u201d she asked, looking down at my face. \u201cHave you cried your\ngrief away?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am afraid I never shall do that.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma\u2019am, and everybody else, will\nnow think me wicked.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as\na good girl, and you will satisfy us.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall I, Miss Temple?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will,\u201d said she, passing her arm round me. \u201cAnd now tell me who is the\nlady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?\u201d\n \n\u201cMrs. Reed, my uncle\u2019s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard\nthe servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep\nme.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is\naccused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been\ncharged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever\nyour memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.\u201d\n \nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate\u2014most\ncorrect; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently\nwhat I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by\nemotion, my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed\nthat sad theme; and mindful of Helen\u2019s warnings against the indulgence of\nresentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than\nordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I\nwent on that Miss Temple fully believed me.\n \nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me\nafter the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the\nred-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break\nbounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which\nclutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and\nlocked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.\n \nI had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she then\nsaid\u2014\n \n\u201cI know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with\nyour statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me,\nJane, you are clear now.\u201d\n \nShe kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well contented to\nstand, for I derived a child\u2019s pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her\ndress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining\ncurls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.\n \n\u201cHow are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot quite so much, I think, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the pain in your chest?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is a little better.\u201d\n \nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to\nher own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She was pensive a few\nminutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully\u2014\n \n\u201cBut you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.\u201d She rang her\nbell.\n \n\u201cBarbara,\u201d she said to the servant who answered it, \u201cI have not yet had tea;\nbring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.\u201d\n \nAnd a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and\nbright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How\nfragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which,\nhowever, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a\nvery small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\n \n\u201cBarbara,\u201d said she, \u201ccan you not bring a little more bread and butter? There\nis not enough for three.\u201d\n \nBarbara went out: she returned soon\u2014\n \n\u201cMadam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.\u201d\n \nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\nBrocklehurst\u2019s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\n \n\u201cOh, very well!\u201d returned Miss Temple; \u201cwe must make it do, Barbara, I\nsuppose.\u201d And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, \u201cFortunately, I have it\nin my power to supply deficiencies for this once.\u201d\n \nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us\na cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked\na drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to\nour eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\n \n\u201cI meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,\u201d said she, \u201cbut as\nthere is so little toast, you must have it now,\u201d and she proceeded to cut\nslices with a generous hand.\n \nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of\nthe entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess\nregarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she\nliberally supplied.\n \nTea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat one on\neach side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and Helen, which\nit was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\n \nMiss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her mien,\nof refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation into the\nardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those\nwho looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such\nwas my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.\n \nThe refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her\nbeloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own\nunique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first,\nthey glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never\nseen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes,\nwhich had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple\u2019s\u2014a\nbeauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of\nmeaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language\nflowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large\nenough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid\neloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen\u2019s discourse on that, to me,\nmemorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span\nas much as many live during a protracted existence.\n \nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of\ncountries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke\nof books: how many they had read! What stores of knowledge they possessed! Then\nthey seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement\nreached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a\nmoment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a\nshelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ\nof veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere\nthe bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us\nboth, saying, as she drew us to her heart\u2014\n \n\u201cGod bless you, my children!\u201d\n \nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was\nHelen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second time breathed a\nsad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.\n \nOn reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was\nexamining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns\u2019s, and when we entered\nHelen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should\nhave half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.\n \n\u201cMy things were indeed in shameful disorder,\u201d murmured Helen to me, in a low\nvoice: \u201cI intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.\u201d\n \nNext morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of\npasteboard the word \u201cSlattern,\u201d and bound it like a phylactery round Helen\u2019s\nlarge, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore it till\nevening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The\nmoment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it\noff, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was incapable had been\nburning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been\nscalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an\nintolerable pain at the heart.\n \nAbout a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had\nwritten to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what he said went\nto corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school,\nannounced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane\nEyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely\ncleared from every imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed\nme, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.\n \nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved\nto pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was\nproportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with\npractice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher\nclass; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I\nlearned the first two tenses of the verb Etre, and sketched my first\ncottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning\ntower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to\nprepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white\nbread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\nfeasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark;\nall the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque\nrocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies\nhovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren\u2019s nests\nenclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined,\ntoo, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a\ncertain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was\nthat problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.\n \nWell has Solomon said\u2014\u201cBetter is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a\nstalled ox and hatred therewith.\u201d\n \nI would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and\nits daily luxuries.\n",
        "\nBut the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring drew\non: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows\nwere melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and\nswollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside\nunder the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by\ntheir Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now\nendure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began\neven to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds,\nwhich, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at\nnight, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out\namongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed\npansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found\nstill sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\n \nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only\nbounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this\npleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow,\nrich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling\neddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath\nthe iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!\u2014when mists as\nchill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks,\nand rolled down \u201cing\u201d and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the\nbeck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder\nthe wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild\nrain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed\nonly ranks of skeletons.\n \nApril advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid\nsunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration. And now\nvegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all\ngreen, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to\nmajestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered\nvarieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out\nof the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in\novershadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed\noften and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty\nand pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.\n \nHave I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as\nbosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? Assuredly,\npleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.\n \nThat forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred\npestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan\nAsylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere\nMay arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.\n \nSemi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to\nreceive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.\nClasses were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed\nalmost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the\nnecessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been\notherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple\u2019s whole\nattention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never\nquitting it except to snatch a few hours\u2019 rest at night. The teachers were\nfully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the\ndeparture of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and\nrelations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many,\nalready smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were\nburied quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.\n \nWhile disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent\nvisitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and\npassages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving\nvainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded\nover the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too,\nglowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened,\ntulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with\npink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and\nevening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all\nuseless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a\nhandful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.\n \nBut I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene\nand season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till\nnight; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too. Mr.\nBrocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were\nnot scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear\nof infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary,\nunused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.\nBesides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our\nbreakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a\nregular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold\npie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to\nthe wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.\n \nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the\nvery middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a\nfeat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate,\ncomfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade\u2014one Mary Ann\nWilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly\nbecause she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which\nset me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and\ncould tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found\ngratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb\nor rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she\nliked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much\nentertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.\n \nAnd where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet days of\nliberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown\ntired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was\ninferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and\nreciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have\nspoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the\nprivilege of her converse a taste of far higher things.\n \nTrue, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with\nmany faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor\never ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender,\nand respectful as any that ever animated my heart. How could it be otherwise,\nwhen Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet\nand faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never\ntroubled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed\nfrom my sight to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the\nhospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was\nconsumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood\nsomething mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.\n \nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs\non very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden;\nbut, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw\nher from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much\nwrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.\n \nOne evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann\nin the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had\nwandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely\ncottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild\nswine that fed on the mast in the wood. When we got back, it was after\nmoonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon\u2019s, was standing at the garden\ndoor. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr.\nBates had been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I\nstayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug\nup in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the\nmorning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet\nas the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still\nglowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose\nwith such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and enjoying\nthem as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:\u2014\n \n\u201cHow sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying! This\nworld is pleasant\u2014it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go\nwho knows where?\u201d\n \nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been\ninfused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled,\nbaffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it,\nit saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood\u2014the\npresent; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at\nthe thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this\nnew idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a\nnurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to\nclose the door, but I ran up to her.\n \n\u201cHow is Helen Burns?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery poorly,\u201d was the answer.\n \n\u201cIs it her Mr. Bates has been to see?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what does he say about her?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe says she\u2019ll not be here long.\u201d\n \nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the\nnotion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I\nshould not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly\nnow! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her\nlast days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of\nspirits, if such region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a\nstrong thrill of grief, then a desire\u2014a necessity to see her; and I asked in\nwhat room she lay.\n \n\u201cShe is in Miss Temple\u2019s room,\u201d said the nurse.\n \n\u201cMay I go up and speak to her?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you\u2019ll\ncatch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.\u201d\n \nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to\nthe schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o\u2019clock, and Miss Miller was\ncalling the pupils to go to bed.\n \nIt might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I\u2014not having been able\nto fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my\ncompanions were all wrapt in profound repose\u2014rose softly, put on my frock over\nmy night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in\nquest of Miss Temple\u2019s room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I\nknew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and\nthere at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of\ncamphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I\npassed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should\nhear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see\nHelen,\u2014I must embrace her before she died,\u2014I must give her one last kiss,\nexchange with her one last word.\n \nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and\nsucceeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another\nflight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss\nTemple\u2019s room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a\nprofound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door\nslightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of\nsickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses\u2014soul and\nsenses quivering with keen throes\u2014I put it back and looked in. My eye sought\nHelen, and feared to find death.\n \nClose by Miss Temple\u2019s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there\nstood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the\nface was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an\neasy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple\nwas not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious\npatient in the fever-room. I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand\nwas on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still\nrecoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.\n \n\u201cHelen!\u201d I whispered softly, \u201care you awake?\u201d\n \nShe stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted,\nbut quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly\ndissipated.\n \n\u201cCan it be you, Jane?\u201d she asked, in her own gentle voice.\n \n\u201cOh!\u201d I thought, \u201cshe is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could not\nspeak and look so calmly if she were.\u201d\n \nI got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both\ncold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.\n \n\u201cWhy are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o\u2019clock: I heard it strike some\nminutes since.\u201d\n \n\u201cI came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep\ntill I had spoken to you.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; to my long home\u2014my last home.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, no, Helen!\u201d I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit\nof coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was\nover, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered\u2014\n \n\u201cJane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.\u201d\n \nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long\nsilence, she resumed, still whispering\u2014\n \n\u201cI am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and\nnot grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the\nillness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind\nis at rest. I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is\nlately married, and will not miss me. By dying young, I shall escape great\nsufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the\nworld: I should have been continually at fault.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe; I have faith: I am going to God.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere is God? What is God?\u201d\n \n\u201cMy Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely implicitly\non His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that\neventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our\nsouls can get to it when we die?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my\nimmortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is my friend:\nI love Him; I believe He loves me.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty,\nuniversal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.\u201d\n \nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought. \u201cWhere is that region? Does\nit exist?\u201d And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me\nthan ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on\nher neck. Presently she said, in the sweetest tone\u2014\n \n\u201cHow comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel\nas if I could sleep: but don\u2019t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you warm, darling?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-night, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-night, Helen.\u201d\n \nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.\n \nWhen I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in\nsomebody\u2019s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage\nback to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had\nsomething else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many\nquestions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning\nto her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against\nHelen Burns\u2019s shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen\nwas\u2014dead.\n \nHer grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it\nwas only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the\nspot, inscribed with her name, and the word \u201cResurgam.\u201d\n",
        "\nHitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence: to\nthe first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters. But this\nis not to be a regular autobiography: I am only bound to invoke Memory where I\nknow her responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a\nspace of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep\nup the links of connection.\n \nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it\ngradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of\nits victims had drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made into the\norigin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited\npublic indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the\nquantity and quality of the children\u2019s food; the brackish, fetid water used in\nits preparation; the pupils\u2019 wretched clothing and accommodations\u2014all these\nthings were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr.\nBrocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\n \nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for\nthe erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new\nregulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds\nof the school were intrusted to the management of a committee. Mr.\nBrocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be\noverlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the\ndischarge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising\nminds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to\ncombine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with\nuprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble\ninstitution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for\neight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my\ntestimony to its value and importance.\n \nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was\nnot inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach;\na fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with\na great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me\non: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me. In time I rose to be\nthe first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of\nteacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that\ntime I altered.\n \nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the\nseminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her\nfriendship and society had been my continual solace; she had stood me in the\nstead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she\nmarried, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy\nof such a wife) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.\n \nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled\nfeeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I\nhad imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more\nharmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the\ninmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I\nbelieved I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I\nappeared a disciplined and subdued character.\n \nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss\nTemple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly\nafter the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear\nbeyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude\nthe greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.\n \nI walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to be\nregretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were\nconcluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening\nfar advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I\nhad undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had\nborrowed of Miss Temple\u2014or rather that she had taken with her the serene\natmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity\u2014and that now I was left in my\nnatural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not\nseem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was\nnot the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for\ntranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my\nexperience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real\nworld was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and\nexcitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to\nseek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\n \nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the\nbuilding; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the\nhilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote,\nthe blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of\nrock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road\nwinding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two;\nhow I longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled\nthat very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an\nage seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and\nI had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs.\nReed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had\never been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the\nouter world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and\nvoices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and\nantipathies\u2014such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not\nenough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired\nliberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed\nscattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler\nsupplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into\nvague space: \u201cThen,\u201d I cried, half desperate, \u201cgrant me at least a new\nservitude!\u201d\n \nHere a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\n \nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime:\neven then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject\nto which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How I wished\nsleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which\nhad last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion\nwould rise for my relief.\n \nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her\nhabitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as\na nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was\ndebarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.\n \n\u201cA new servitude! There is something in that,\u201d I soliloquised (mentally, be it\nunderstood; I did not talk aloud). \u201cI know there is, because it does not sound\ntoo sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment:\ndelightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and\nfleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That\nmust be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now\nall I want is to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not\nthe thing feasible? Yes\u2014yes\u2014the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain\nactive enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.\u201d\n \nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I\ncovered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again\nwith all my might.\n \n\u201cWhat do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new\ncircumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How\ndo people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no\nfriends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for\nthemselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?\u201d\n \nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a\nresponse, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in\nmy head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result\ncame of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the\nroom; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again\ncrept to bed.\n \nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my\npillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind:\u2014\u201cThose who\nwant situations advertise; you must advertise in the \u2014\u2014shire Herald.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow? I know nothing about advertising.\u201d\n \nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:\u2014\n \n\u201cYou must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover\ndirected to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the first\nopportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to\nJ.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after\nyou send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.\u201d\n \nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had\nit in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.\n \nWith earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed, and\ndirected before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:\u2014\n \n\u201cA young lady accustomed to tuition\u201d (had I not been a teacher two years?) \u201cis\ndesirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are\nunder fourteen\u201d (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to\nundertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age). \u201cShe is qualified to teach\nthe usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing,\nand Music\u201d (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of\naccomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). \u201cAddress, J.E.,\nPost-office, Lowton, \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\n \nThis document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of\nthe new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small\ncommissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was\nreadily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet,\nbut the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into\nthe post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but\nwith a relieved heart.\n \nThe succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all\nsublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I\nfound myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the\nway; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the\ndale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be\nawaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea\nand water.\n \nMy ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes;\nso I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the\nclean and quiet little street from the shoemaker\u2019s to the post-office: it was\nkept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on\nher hands.\n \n\u201cAre there any letters for J.E.?\u201d I asked.\n \nShe peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled\namong its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter. At\nlast, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she\npresented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive\nand mistrustful glance\u2014it was for J.E.\n \n\u201cIs there only one?\u201d I demanded.\n \n\u201cThere are no more,\u201d said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face\nhomeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and\nit was already half-past seven.\n \nVarious duties awaited me on my arrival: I had to sit with the girls during\ntheir hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed:\nafterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we finally retired for\nthe night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a\nshort end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till\nit was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten\nproduced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had finished\nundressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter;\nthe seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.\n \n\u201cIf J.E., who advertised in the \u2014\u2014shire Herald of last Thursday,\npossesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give\nsatisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be\noffered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of\nage; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E. is requested to send\nreferences, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:\u2014\n \n\u201cMrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\n \nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather\nuncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a\nprivate fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own\nguidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I\nwished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en r\u00e8gle.\nI now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on\nhand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow\u2019s cap; frigid, perhaps,\nbut not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that,\ndoubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I\nfailed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote,\n\u2014\u2014shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England; yes, I saw it;\nboth the shire and the town. \u2014\u2014shire was seventy miles nearer London than the\nremote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to\ngo where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town\non the banks of the A\u2014\u2014: a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it\nwould be a complete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by\nthe idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke\u2014\u201cbut,\u201d I argued, \u201cThornfield\nwill, probably, be a good way from the town.\u201d\n \nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\n \nNext day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my\nown breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success. Having sought\nand obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation,\nI told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would\nbe double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got \u00a315 per annum);\nand requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of\nthe committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as\nreferences. She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The\nnext day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed\nmust be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was accordingly\naddressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that \u201cI might do as I pleased:\nshe had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.\u201d This note went the\nround of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious\ndelay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an\nassurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher\nand pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the\ninspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.\n \nThis testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of\nit to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady\u2019s reply, stating that she was satisfied,\nand fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of\ngoverness in her house.\n \nI now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a\nvery large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day\nsufficed to pack my trunk,\u2014the same I had brought with me eight years ago from\nGateshead.\n \nThe box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was to call\nfor it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour\nthe next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my black stuff\ntravelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my\ndrawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to\ndo, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all\nday, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my\nlife was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber\nin the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being\naccomplished.\n \n\u201cMiss,\u201d said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a\ntroubled spirit, \u201ca person below wishes to see you.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe carrier, no doubt,\u201d I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. I was\npassing the back-parlour or teachers\u2019 sitting-room, the door of which was half\nopen, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out\u2014\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s her, I am sure!\u2014I could have told her anywhere!\u201d cried the individual who\nstopped my progress and took my hand.\n \nI looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, yet\nstill young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively\ncomplexion.\n \n\u201cWell, who is it?\u201d she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised;\n\u201cyou\u2019ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?\u201d\n \nIn another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: \u201cBessie! Bessie!\nBessie!\u201d that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both\nwent into the parlour. By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in\nplaid frock and trousers.\n \n\u201cThat is my little boy,\u201d said Bessie directly.\n \n\u201cThen you are married, Bessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I\u2019ve a little\ngirl besides Bobby there, that I\u2019ve christened Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t live at Gateshead?\u201d\n \n\u201cI live at the lodge: the old porter has left.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but\nsit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?\u201d but Bobby\npreferred sidling over to his mother.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,\u201d continued Mrs.\nLeaven. \u201cI dare say they\u2019ve not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the\nhead and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of\nyou in breadth.\u201d\n \n\u201cGeorgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody\nadmired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were\nagainst the match; and\u2014what do you think?\u2014he and Miss Georgiana made it up to\nrun away; but they were found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them\nout: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog\nlife together; they are always quarrelling\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, and what of John Reed?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to college, and he\ngot\u2014plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a\nbarrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will\nnever make much of him, I think.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has\nsuch thick lips.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd Mrs. Reed?\u201d\n \n\u201cMissis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she\u2019s not quite\neasy in her mind: Mr. John\u2019s conduct does not please her\u2014he spends a deal of\nmoney.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid she send you here, Bessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had\nbeen a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country,\nI thought I\u2019d just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of\nmy reach.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.\u201d I said this laughing: I\nperceived that Bessie\u2019s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape\ndenote admiration.\n \n\u201cNo, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and\nit is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.\u201d\n \nI smiled at Bessie\u2019s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I\nwas not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to\nplease, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that\ndesire brings anything but gratification.\n \n\u201cI dare say you are clever, though,\u201d continued Bessie, by way of solace. \u201cWhat\ncan you do? Can you play on the piano?\u201d\n \n\u201cA little.\u201d\n \nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit\ndown and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.\n \n\u201cThe Miss Reeds could not play as well!\u201d said she exultingly. \u201cI always said\nyou would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.\u201d It was a landscape in\nwater colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in\nacknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and\nwhich she had framed and glazed.\n \n\u201cWell, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed\u2019s\ndrawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could\nnot come near it: and have you learnt French?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you can work on muslin and canvas?\u201d\n \n\u201cI can.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on\nwhether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask\nyou. Have you ever heard anything from your father\u2019s kinsfolk, the Eyres?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever in my life.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and\nthey may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for\none day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see\nyou; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much\ndisappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign\ncountry, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite\na gentleman, and I believe he was your father\u2019s brother.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat foreign country was he going to, Bessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cAn island thousands of miles off, where they make wine\u2014the butler did tell\nme\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cMadeira?\u201d I suggested.\n \n\u201cYes, that is it\u2014that is the very word.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo he went?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him;\nshe called him afterwards a \u2018sneaking tradesman.\u2019 My Robert believes he was a\nwine-merchant.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery likely,\u201d I returned; \u201cor perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.\u201d\n \nBessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was obliged\nto leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton,\nwhile I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the door of the\nBrocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow\nof Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead,\nI mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the\nunknown environs of Millcote.\n",
        "\nA new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I\ndraw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the\nGeorge Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn\nrooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece,\nsuch prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the\nPrince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is\nvisible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by\nthat of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and\numbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill\ncontracted by sixteen hours\u2019 exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left\nLowton at four o\u2019clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now\njust striking eight.\n \nReader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my\nmind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me;\nI looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the \u201cboots\u201d placed for\nmy convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some\ndescription of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort\nwas visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a\nMiss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request\nto be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of\ndoubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.\n \nIt is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite\nalone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the\nport to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments\nfrom returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that\nsensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it;\nand fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was\nalone. I bethought myself to ring the bell.\n \n\u201cIs there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?\u201d I asked of the\nwaiter who answered the summons.\n \n\u201cThornfield? I don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am; I\u2019ll inquire at the bar.\u201d He vanished, but\nreappeared instantly\u2014\n \n\u201cIs your name Eyre, Miss?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerson here waiting for you.\u201d\n \nI jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a\nman was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a\none-horse conveyance.\n \n\u201cThis will be your luggage, I suppose?\u201d said the man rather abruptly when he\nsaw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got\nin; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.\n \n\u201cA matter of six miles.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow long shall we be before we get there?\u201d\n \n\u201cHappen an hour and a half.\u201d\n \nHe fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set off. Our\nprogress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be\nat length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the\ncomfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.\n \n\u201cI suppose,\u201d thought I, \u201cjudging from the plainness of the servant and\ncarriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I\nnever lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them. I\nwonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any\ndegree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best;\nit is a pity that doing one\u2019s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I\ntook that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I\nremember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not\nturn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her!\nlet the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again. How far are we on our\nroad now, I wonder?\u201d\n \nI let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the\nnumber of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger\nthan Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there\nwere houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different\nregion to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less\nromantic.\n \nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the\nway, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last\nhe turned in his seat and said\u2014\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re noan so far fro\u2019 Thornfield now.\u201d\n \nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against\nthe sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights\ntoo, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the\ndriver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed\nto behind us. We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a\nhouse: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were\ndark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I\nalighted and went in.\n \n\u201cWill you walk this way, ma\u2019am?\u201d said the girl; and I followed her across a\nsquare hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double\nillumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with\nthe darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see,\nhowever, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.\n \nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed\nand old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in\nwidow\u2019s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had\nfancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking. She was occupied in\nknitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to\ncomplete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for\na new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to\noverwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady\ngot up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\n \n\u201cHow do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives\nso slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.\u201d\n \n\u201cMrs. Fairfax, I suppose?\u201d said I.\n \n\u201cYes, you are right: do sit down.\u201d\n \nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie\nmy bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.\n \n\u201cOh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.\nLeah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of\nthe storeroom.\u201d\n \nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\ndelivered them to the servant.\n \n\u201cNow, then, draw nearer to the fire,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought your\nluggage with you, haven\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll see it carried into your room,\u201d she said, and bustled out.\n \n\u201cShe treats me like a visitor,\u201d thought I. \u201cI little expected such a reception;\nI anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard\nof the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.\u201d\n \nShe returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or\ntwo from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then\nherself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather confused at being the object\nof more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my\nemployer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was\ndoing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her civilities\nquietly.\n \n\u201cShall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?\u201d I asked, when I\nhad partaken of what she offered me.\n \n\u201cWhat did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,\u201d returned the good lady,\napproaching her ear to my mouth.\n \nI repeated the question more distinctly.\n \n\u201cMiss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your future\npupil.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed! Then she is not your daughter?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u2014I have no family.\u201d\n \nI should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens\nwas connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many\nquestions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\n \n\u201cI am so glad,\u201d she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took the cat\non her knee; \u201cI am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here\nnow with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is\na fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a\nrespectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in\nthe best quarters. I say alone\u2014Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his\nwife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one\ncan\u2019t converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\ndistance, for fear of losing one\u2019s authority. I\u2019m sure last winter (it was a\nvery severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and\nblew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from\nNovember till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night\nafter night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don\u2019t think the\npoor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one\ngot on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at\nthe commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a\nchild makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite\ngay.\u201d\n \nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my\nchair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she might find\nmy company as agreeable as she anticipated.\n \n\u201cBut I\u2019ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,\u201d said she; \u201cit is on the\nstroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel\ntired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I\u2019ll show you your bedroom. I\u2019ve\nhad the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I\nthought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be\nsure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never\nsleep in them myself.\u201d\n \nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my\nlong journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her candle, and I\nfollowed her from the room. First she went to see if the hall-door was\nfastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The\nsteps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed;\nboth it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if\nthey belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vault-like air\npervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and\nsolitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of\nsmall dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\n \nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door,\ngazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by\nthat wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery,\nby the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of\nbodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse\nof gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up\nthanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my\nfurther path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly\noffered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my\nsolitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly:\nwhen I awoke it was broad day.\n \nThe chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between\nthe gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted\nfloor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits\nrose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a\nfairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and\npleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change\nof scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely\ndefine what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day\nor that month, but at an indefinite future period.\n \nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain\u2014for I had no article of\nattire that was not made with extreme simplicity\u2014I was still by nature\nsolicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or\ncareless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as\nwell as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I\nsometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy\ncheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately,\nand finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so\npale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these\naspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then\ndistinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason\ntoo. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black\nfrock\u2014which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a\nnicety\u2014and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably\nenough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least\nrecoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I\nleft all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\n \nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak;\nthen I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on\nthe walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady\nwith powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the\nceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon\nblack with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to\nme; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was\nhalf of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn\nmorning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green\nfields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the\nmansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\nconsiderable: a gentleman\u2019s manor-house, not a nobleman\u2019s seat: battlements\nround the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out well from\nthe background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they\nflew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these\nwere separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees,\nstrong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the\nmansion\u2019s designation. Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round\nLowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living\nworld; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield\nwith a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring\nlocality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees,\nstraggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood\nnearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and\ngates.\n \nI was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with\ndelight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the\nhall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like\nMrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.\n \n\u201cWhat! out already?\u201d said she. \u201cI see you are an early riser.\u201d I went up to\nher, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\n \n\u201cHow do you like Thornfield?\u201d she asked. I told her I liked it very much.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cit is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of\norder, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside\nhere permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine\ngrounds require the presence of the proprietor.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWho is he?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe owner of Thornfield,\u201d she responded quietly. \u201cDid you not know he was\ncalled Rochester?\u201d\n \nOf course I did not\u2014I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to\nregard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody\nmust be acquainted by instinct.\n \n\u201cI thought,\u201d I continued, \u201cThornfield belonged to you.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the housekeeper\u2014the\nmanager. To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother\u2019s\nside, or at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay\u2014that\nlittle village yonder on the hill\u2014and that church near the gates was his. The\npresent Mr. Rochester\u2019s mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband:\nbut I never presume on the connection\u2014in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider\nmyself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always\ncivil, and I expect nothing more.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the little girl\u2014my pupil!\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is Mr. Rochester\u2019s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her.\nHe intended to have her brought up in \u2014\u2014shire, I believe. Here she comes, with\nher \u2018bonne,\u2019 as she calls her nurse.\u201d The enigma then was explained: this\naffable and kind little widow was no great dame; but a dependent like myself. I\ndid not like her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased\nthan ever. The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of\ncondescension on her part: so much the better\u2014my position was all the freer.\n \nAs I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\nattendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not at first\nappear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old,\nslightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair\nfalling in curls to her waist.\n \n\u201cGood morning, Miss Adela,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cCome and speak to the lady who\nis to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.\u201d She approached.\n \n\u201cC\u2019est l\u00e0 ma gouvernante!\u201d said she, pointing to me, and addressing her nurse;\nwho answered\u2014\n \n\u201cMais oui, certainement.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre they foreigners?\u201d I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.\n \n\u201cThe nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe,\nnever left it till within six months ago. When she first came here she could\nspeak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don\u2019t\nunderstand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning\nvery well, I dare say.\u201d\n \nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady;\nand as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as\nI could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of\nFrench by heart daily\u2014applying myself to take pains with my accent, and\nimitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had\nacquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was\nnot likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook\nhands with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to\nbreakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied\nbriefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had examined\nme some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced\nchattering fluently.\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d cried she, in French, \u201cyou speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester\ndoes: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad:\nnobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse;\nshe came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked\u2014how it\ndid smoke!\u2014and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr.\nRochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and\nI had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a\nshelf. And Mademoiselle\u2014what is your name?\u201d\n \n\u201cEyre\u2014Jane Eyre.\u201d\n \n\u201cAire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it\nwas quite daylight, at a great city\u2014a huge city, with very dark houses and all\nsmoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester\ncarried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we\nall got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than\nthis and finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie\nused to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park;\nand there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds\nin it, that I fed with crumbs.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan you understand her when she runs on so fast?\u201d asked Mrs. Fairfax.\n \nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of\nMadame Pierrot.\n \n\u201cI wish,\u201d continued the good lady, \u201cyou would ask her a question or two about\nher parents: I wonder if she remembers them?\u201d\n \n\u201cAd\u00e8le,\u201d I inquired, \u201cwith whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean\ntown you spoke of?\u201d\n \n\u201cI lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama used to\nteach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and\nladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their\nknees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now?\u201d\n \nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her\naccomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my\nknee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her\ncurls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from\nsome opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the\nperfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her\nin her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one\nthat night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how\nlittle his desertion has affected her.\n \nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the\npoint of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled\nwith the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I\nthought so.\n \nAd\u00e8le sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of\nher age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, \u201cNow, Mademoiselle, I\nwill repeat you some poetry.\u201d\n \nAssuming an attitude, she began, \u201cLa Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.\u201d She\nthen declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis,\na flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed\nat her age, and which proved she had been carefully trained.\n \n\u201cWas it your mama who taught you that piece?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cYes, and she just used to say it in this way: \u2018Qu\u2019avez vous donc? lui dit un\nde ces rats; parlez!\u2019 She made me lift my hand\u2014so\u2014to remind me to raise my\nvoice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say,\nwith whom did you live then?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith Madame Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing\nrelated to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama. I\nwas not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with\nhim in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but\nyou see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he\nis gone back again himself, and I never see him.\u201d\n \nAfter breakfast, Ad\u00e8le and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears,\nMr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books\nwere locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open\ncontaining everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and\nseveral volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few\nromances, &c. I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess\nwould require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for\nthe present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to\nglean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and\ninformation. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of\nsuperior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.\n \nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not\nbeen used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be injudicious to\nconfine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and\ngot her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed\nher to return to her nurse. I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time\nin drawing some little sketches for her use.\n \nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called\nto me: \u201cYour morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,\u201d said she. She was\nin a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed\nme. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a\nTurkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass,\nand a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine\npurple spar, which stood on a sideboard.\n \n\u201cWhat a beautiful room!\u201d I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before\nseen any half so imposing.\n \n\u201cYes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in a\nlittle air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are\nseldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.\u201d\n \nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a\nTyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two broad steps, and\nlooking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my\nnovice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty\ndrawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which\nseemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of\nwhite grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson\ncouches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were\nof sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors\nrepeated the general blending of snow and fire.\n \n\u201cIn what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d said I. \u201cNo dust, no canvas\ncoverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were\ninhabited daily.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester\u2019s visits here are rare, they are always\nsudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything\nswathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it\nbest to keep the rooms in readiness.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot particularly so; but he has a gentleman\u2019s tastes and habits, and he\nexpects to have things managed in conformity to them.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you like him? Is he generally liked?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in\nthis neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time\nout of mind.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked\nfor himself?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\nconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived\nmuch amongst them.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps:\nhe has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should\nthink. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn what way is he peculiar?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014it is not easy to describe\u2014nothing striking, but you feel it when\nhe speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest,\nwhether he is pleased or the contrary; you don\u2019t thoroughly understand him, in\nshort\u2014at least, I don\u2019t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good\nmaster.\u201d\n \nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine.\nThere are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or\nobserving and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good\nlady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her\nout. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed\nproprietor\u2014nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently\nwondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.\n \nWhen we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the\nhouse; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all\nwas well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially\ngrand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were\ninteresting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the\nlower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed:\nand the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a\nhundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange\ncarvings of palm branches and cherubs\u2019 heads, like types of the Hebrew ark;\nrows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,\non whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries,\nwrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these\nrelics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the\npast: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these\nretreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night\u2019s repose on one of those\nwide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others,\nwith wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies\nof strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,\u2014all which\nwould have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.\n \n\u201cDo the servants sleep in these rooms?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cNo; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps\nhere: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this\nwould be its haunt.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo I think: you have no ghost, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cNone that I ever heard of,\u201d returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\n \n\u201cNor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent\nthan a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest\ntranquilly in their graves now.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014\u2018after life\u2019s fitful fever they sleep well,\u2019\u201d I muttered. \u201cWhere are you\ngoing now, Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d for she was moving away.\n \n\u201cOn to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?\u201d I followed\nstill, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and\nthrough a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow\ncolony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements and\nlooking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and\nvelvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a\npark, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path\nvisibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the\nchurch at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn\nday\u2019s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly\nwhite. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I\nturned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the\nladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air\nto which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and\ngreen hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing\nwith delight.\n \nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint of\ngroping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow\ngarret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating\nthe front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only\none little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black\ndoors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard\u2019s castle.\n \nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a\nregion, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal,\nmirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again,\nlouder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off in a\nclamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it\noriginated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents\nissued.\n \n\u201cMrs. Fairfax!\u201d I called out: for I now heard her descending the great stairs.\n\u201cDid you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cSome of the servants, very likely,\u201d she answered: \u201cperhaps Grace Poole.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you hear it?\u201d I again inquired.\n \n\u201cYes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah\nis with her; they are frequently noisy together.\u201d\n \nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd\nmurmur.\n \n\u201cGrace!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\n \nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as\npreternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and\nthat no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but\nthat neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously\nafraid. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even\nof surprise.\n \nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,\u2014a woman of between thirty\nand forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face:\nany apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.\n \n\u201cToo much noise, Grace,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cRemember directions!\u201d Grace\ncurtseyed silently and went in.\n \n\u201cShe is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid\u2019s work,\u201d\ncontinued the widow; \u201cnot altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she\ndoes well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this\nmorning?\u201d\n \nThe conversation, thus turned on Ad\u00e8le, continued till we reached the light and\ncheerful region below. Ad\u00e8le came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming\u2014\n \n\u201cMesdames, vous \u00eates servies!\u201d adding, \u201cJ\u2019ai bien faim, moi!\u201d\n \nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room.\n",
        "\nThe promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield\nHall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place\nand its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a\nplacid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average\nintelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged,\nand therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my\ncare, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans\nfor her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and\nteachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar\ndevelopment of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary\nlevel of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her\nbelow it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though\nperhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and\nefforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment\nsufficient to make us both content in each other\u2019s society.\n \nThis, par parenth\u00e8se, will be thought cool language by persons who\nentertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty\nof those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous\ndevotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or\nprop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a conscientious\nsolicitude for Ad\u00e8le\u2019s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little\nself: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness,\nand a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for\nme, and the moderation of her mind and character.\n \nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I\ntook a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked\nthrough them along the road; or when, while Ad\u00e8le played with her nurse, and\nMrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases,\nraised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out\nafar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line\u2014that then I longed\nfor a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the\nbusy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen\u2014that then\nI desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse\nwith my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within\nmy reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Ad\u00e8le;\nbut I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and\nwhat I believed in I wished to behold.\n \nWho blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not\nhelp it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.\nThen my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey,\nbackwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow\nmy mind\u2019s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it\u2014and,\ncertainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the\nexultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with\nlife; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended\u2014a\ntale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of\nincident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual\nexistence.\n \nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they\nmust have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are\ncondemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt\nagainst their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political\nrebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed\nto be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise\nfor their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers\ndo; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation,\nprecisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged\nfellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making\npuddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.\nIt is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or\nlearn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\n \nWhen thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole\u2019s laugh: the same peal,\nthe same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard,\ntoo, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There were days when she\nwas quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds\nshe made. Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or\na plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return,\ngenerally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!)\nbearing a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the\ncuriosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no\npoint to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into\nconversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply\nusually cut short every effort of that sort.\n \nThe other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the\nhousemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect\nremarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her\nquestions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or\nnarrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were\ncalculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.\n \nOctober, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax\nhad begged a holiday for Ad\u00e8le, because she had a cold; and, as Ad\u00e8le seconded\nthe request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays\nhad been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in\nshowing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I\nwas tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs.\nFairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on\nmy bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two\nmiles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Ad\u00e8le comfortably\nseated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour fireside, and given her\nher best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer)\nto play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to\nher \u201cRevenez bient\u00f4t, ma bonne amie, ma ch\u00e8re Mdlle. Jeannette,\u201d with a kiss, I\nset out.\n \nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till\nI got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of\npleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was three o\u2019clock; the\nchurch bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in\nits approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile\nfrom Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and\nblackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips\nand haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless\nrepose. If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a\nholly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes\nwere as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the\npath. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now\nbrowsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge,\nlooked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.\n \nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat\ndown on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering my mantle about me,\nand sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze\nkeenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little\nbrooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.\nFrom my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall\nwas the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\nagainst the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank\ncrimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.\n \nOn the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but\nbrightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent\nup a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the\nabsolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt\nthe flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were\nmany hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes. That\nevening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the\nmost remote.\n \nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away\nand so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the\nsoft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough\nboles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the\na\u00ebrial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where\ntint melts into tint.\n \nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet\nhid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was\nnarrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I was young, and all sorts\nof fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories\nwere there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added\nto them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse\napproached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered\ncertain of Bessie\u2019s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a\n\u201cGytrash,\u201d which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary\nways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming\nupon me.\n \nIt was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp,\nI heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a\ngreat dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the\ntrees. It was exactly one form of Bessie\u2019s Gytrash\u2014a lion-like creature with\nlong hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying\nto look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it\nwould. The horse followed,\u2014a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the\nhuman being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was\nalways alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb\ncarcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.\nNo Gytrash was this,\u2014only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He\npassed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an\nexclamation of \u201cWhat the deuce is to do now?\u201d and a clattering tumble, arrested\nmy attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice\nwhich glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in\na predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills\nechoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed\nround the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could\ndo,\u2014there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to\nthe traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts\nwere so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the\nquestion\u2014\n \n\u201cAre you injured, sir?\u201d\n \nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some\nformula which prevented him from replying to me directly.\n \n\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d I asked again.\n \n\u201cYou must just stand on one side,\u201d he answered as he rose, first to his knees,\nand then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering\nprocess, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some\nyards\u2019 distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event.\nThis was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was\nsilenced with a \u201cDown, Pilot!\u201d The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and\nleg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for\nhe halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\n \nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now\ndrew near him again.\n \n\u201cIf you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from\nThornfield Hall or from Hay.\u201d\n \n\u201cThank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,\u2014only a sprain;\u201d and again he\nstood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary \u201cUgh!\u201d\n \nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could\nsee him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and\nsteel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points\nof middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with\nstern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful\nand thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age;\nperhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.\nHad he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared\nto stand thus questioning him against his will, and offering my services\nunasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to\none. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,\nfascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I\nshould have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy\nwith anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning,\nor anything else that is bright but antipathetic.\n \nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed\nhim; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should\nhave gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the\nfrown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station\nwhen he waved to me to go, and announced\u2014\n \n\u201cI cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane,\ntill I see you are fit to mount your horse.\u201d\n \nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction\nbefore.\n \n\u201cI should think you ought to be at home yourself,\u201d said he, \u201cif you have a home\nin this neighbourhood: where do you come from?\u201d\n \n\u201cFrom just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is\nmoonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:\nindeed, I am going there to post a letter.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou live just below\u2014do you mean at that house with the battlements?\u201d pointing\nto Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out\ndistinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now\nseemed one mass of shadow.\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester\u2019s.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you know Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I have never seen him.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is not resident, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan you tell me where he is?\u201d\n \n\u201cI cannot.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are\u2014\u201d He stopped, ran his\neye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a\nblack beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a lady\u2019s-maid. He\nseemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.\n \n\u201cI am the governess.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh, the governess!\u201d he repeated; \u201cdeuce take me, if I had not forgotten! The\ngoverness!\u201d and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In two minutes he rose\nfrom the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.\n \n\u201cI cannot commission you to fetch help,\u201d he said; \u201cbut you may help me a little\nyourself, if you will be so kind.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cTry to get hold of my horse\u2019s bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?\u201d\n \nI should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it,\nI was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the\ntall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and\nwould not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain:\nmeantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet. The traveller\nwaited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.\n \n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, \u201cthe mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you\ncan do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come\nhere.\u201d\n \nI came. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he continued: \u201cnecessity compels me to make you useful.\u201d\nHe laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some stress, limped\nto his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang\nto his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his\nsprain.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, \u201cjust hand me my\nwhip; it lies there under the hedge.\u201d\n \nI sought it and found it.\n \n\u201cThank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you\ncan.\u201d\n \nA touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then bound\naway; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,\n \n\u201cLike heath that, in the wilderness,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wild wind whirls away.\u201d\n \nI took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone for me:\nit was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet\nit marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been\nneeded and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something;\ntrivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was\nweary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture\nintroduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others\nhanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was\ndark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and\nslipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill\nall the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round\nand listened, with an idea that a horse\u2019s hoofs might ring on the causeway\nagain, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might\nbe again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising\nup still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of\nwind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when\nI glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the\nhall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was\nlate, and I hurried on.\n \nI did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to return to\nstagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek\nmy own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend\nthe long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint\nexcitement wakened by my walk,\u2014to slip again over my faculties the viewless\nfetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very\nprivileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What\ngood it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an\nuncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter\nexperience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much\ngood as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a \u201ctoo easy chair\u201d to take\na long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,\nas it would be under his.\n \nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards\non the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see\ninto the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy\nhouse\u2014from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me\u2014to\nthat sky expanded before me,\u2014a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon\nascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the\nhill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and\naspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless\ndistance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my\nheart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to\nearth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and\nstars, opened a side-door, and went in.\n \nThe hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a\nwarm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase. This ruddy\nshine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and\nshowed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass\nfire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most\npleasant radiance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had\nscarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices,\namongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Ad\u00e8le, when the door closed.\n \nI hastened to Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle,\nand no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing\nwith gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog,\njust like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went forward and\nsaid\u2014\u201cPilot,\u201d and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed\nhim, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone\nwith, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a\ncandle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.\n \n\u201cWhat dog is this?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe came with master.\u201d\n \n\u201cWith whom?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith master\u2014Mr. Rochester\u2014he is just arrived.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, and Miss Ad\u00e8le; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a\nsurgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is\nsprained.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid the horse fall in Hay Lane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! Bring me a candle will you Leah?\u201d\n \nLeah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news;\nadding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester:\nthen she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off\nmy things.\n",
        "\nMr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon\u2019s orders, went to bed early that night;\nnor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down, it was to attend to\nbusiness: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak\nwith him.\n \nAd\u00e8le and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as\na reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and\nthere I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I\ndiscerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed\nplace: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at\nthe door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new\nvoices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing\nthrough it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\n \nAd\u00e8le was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to\nthe door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of\nMr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I\nshrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted;\nthen, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk\nincessantly of her \u201cami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,\u201d as she\ndubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what\npresents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before,\nthat when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a\nlittle box in whose contents she had an interest.\n \n\u201cEt cela doit signifier,\u201d said she, \u201cqu\u2019il y aura l\u00e0 dedans un cadeau pour moi,\net peut-\u00eatre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parl\u00e9 de vous: il m\u2019a\ndemand\u00e9 le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une petite personne,\nassez mince et un peu p\u00e2le. J\u2019ai dit qu\u2019oui: car c\u2019est vrai, n\u2019est-ce pas,\nmademoiselle?\u201d\n \nI and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour; the afternoon was wild\nand snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Ad\u00e8le to put\naway books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence\nbelow, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that\nMr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but\nnothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the\nair, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back\nto the fireside.\n \nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to\nhave seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in,\nbreaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and\nscattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on\nmy solitude.\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in\nthe drawing-room this evening,\u201d said she: \u201che has been so much engaged all day\nthat he could not ask to see you before.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen is his tea-time?\u201d I inquired.\n \n\u201cOh, at six o\u2019clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had better change\nyour frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it necessary to change my frock?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is\nhere.\u201d\n \nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my\nroom, and, with Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of\nblack silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light\ngrey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be\nworn, except on first-rate occasions.\n \n\u201cYou want a brooch,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament\nwhich Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went\ndownstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus\nformally summoned in Mr. Rochester\u2019s presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me\ninto the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and,\npassing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess\nbeyond.\n \nTwo wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking\nin the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot\u2014Ad\u00e8le knelt near him. Half\nreclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion;\nhe was looking at Ad\u00e8le and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my\ntraveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer\nby the horizontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more\nremarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought,\ncholer; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw\u2014yes, all three were very grim, and no\nmistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness\nwith his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of\nthe term\u2014broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.\n \nMr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself;\nbut it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his\nhead as we approached.\n \n\u201cHere is Miss Eyre, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He bowed, still\nnot taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\n \n\u201cLet Miss Eyre be seated,\u201d said he: and there was something in the forced stiff\nbow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, \u201cWhat\nthe deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am\nnot disposed to accost her.\u201d\n \nI sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would\nprobably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering\ngrace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation;\non the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the\nadvantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt\ninterested to see how he would go on.\n \nHe went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax\nseemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to\ntalk. Kindly, as usual\u2014and, as usual, rather trite\u2014she condoled with him on the\npressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to\nhim with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance\nin going through with it.\n \n\u201cMadam, I should like some tea,\u201d was the sole rejoinder she got. She hastened\nto ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups,\nspoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Ad\u00e8le went to the table; but\nthe master did not leave his couch.\n \n\u201cWill you hand Mr. Rochester\u2019s cup?\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax to me; \u201cAd\u00e8le might\nperhaps spill it.\u201d\n \nI did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Ad\u00e8le, thinking the moment\npropitious for making a request in my favour, cried out\u2014\n \n\u201cN\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur, qu\u2019il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre\npetit coffre?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho talks of cadeaux?\u201d said he gruffly. \u201cDid you expect a present, Miss Eyre?\nAre you fond of presents?\u201d and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were\ndark, irate, and piercing.\n \n\u201cI hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally\nthought pleasant things.\u201d\n \n\u201cGenerally thought? But what do you think?\u201d\n \n\u201cI should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer\nworthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one\nshould consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.\u201d\n \n\u201cMiss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Ad\u00e8le: she demands a \u2018cadeau,\u2019\nclamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I have less confidence in my deserts than Ad\u00e8le has: she can prefer\nthe claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you\nhave always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make\nout a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to\nentitle me to an acknowledgment.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, don\u2019t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Ad\u00e8le, and find you have\ntaken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a\nshort time she has made much improvement.\u201d\n \n\u201cSir, you have now given me my \u2018cadeau;\u2019 I am obliged to you: it is the meed\nteachers most covet\u2014praise of their pupils\u2019 progress.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph!\u201d said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\n \n\u201cCome to the fire,\u201d said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs.\nFairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Ad\u00e8le was leading me\nby the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the\nconsoles and chiffonni\u00e8res. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Ad\u00e8le wanted to take a\nseat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.\n \n\u201cYou have been resident in my house three months?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you came from\u2014?\u201d\n \n\u201cFrom Lowood school, in \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! a charitable concern. How long were you there?\u201d\n \n\u201cEight years.\u201d\n \n\u201cEight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in such a\nplace would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have rather the look\nof another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. When you\ncame on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and\nhad half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure\nyet. Who are your parents?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have none.\u201d\n \n\u201cNor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that\nstile?\u201d\n \n\u201cFor whom, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cFor the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did I break\nthrough one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?\u201d\n \nI shook my head. \u201cThe men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,\u201d\nsaid I, speaking as seriously as he had done. \u201cAnd not even in Hay Lane, or the\nfields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don\u2019t think either summer or\nharvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.\u201d\n \nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed\nwondering what sort of talk this was.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d resumed Mr. Rochester, \u201cif you disown parents, you must have some sort\nof kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; none that I ever saw.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd your home?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have none.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere do your brothers and sisters live?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have no brothers or sisters.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho recommended you to come here?\u201d\n \n\u201cI advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, \u201cand I am\ndaily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre has been an\ninvaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Ad\u00e8le.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself to give her a character,\u201d returned Mr. Rochester:\n\u201ceulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She began by felling my\nhorse.\u201d\n \n\u201cSir?\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax.\n \n\u201cI have to thank her for this sprain.\u201d\n \nThe widow looked bewildered.\n \n\u201cMiss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you seen much society?\u201d\n \n\u201cNone but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\nThornfield.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you read much?\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very\nlearned.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious\nforms;\u2014Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would\nworship their director.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That sounds\nblasphemous.\u201d\n \n\u201cI disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is a harsh\nman; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy\u2019s sake\nbought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat was very false economy,\u201d remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the\ndrift of the dialogue.\n \n\u201cAnd was that the head and front of his offending?\u201d demanded Mr. Rochester.\n \n\u201cHe starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\ndepartment, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long\nlectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing,\nabout sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat age were you when you went to Lowood?\u201d\n \n\u201cAbout ten.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?\u201d\n \nI assented.\n \n\u201cArithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been\nable to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the features and\ncountenance are so much at variance as in your case. And now what did you learn\nat Lowood? Can you play?\u201d\n \n\u201cA little.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course: that is the established answer. Go into the library\u2014I mean, if you\nplease.\u2014(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, \u2018Do this,\u2019 and it is\ndone: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)\u2014Go, then, into\nthe library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the\npiano, and play a tune.\u201d\n \nI departed, obeying his directions.\n \n\u201cEnough!\u201d he called out in a few minutes. \u201cYou play a little, I see;\nlike any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not\nwell.\u201d\n \nI closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued\u2014\n \n\u201cAd\u00e8le showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours. I don\u2019t\nknow whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, indeed!\u201d I interjected.\n \n\u201cAh! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its\ncontents being original; but don\u2019t pass your word unless you are certain: I can\nrecognise patchwork.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.\u201d\n \nI brought the portfolio from the library.\n \n\u201cApproach the table,\u201d said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Ad\u00e8le and Mrs.\nFairfax drew near to see the pictures.\n \n\u201cNo crowding,\u201d said Mr. Rochester: \u201ctake the drawings from my hand as I finish\nwith them; but don\u2019t push your faces up to mine.\u201d\n \nHe deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid aside; the\nothers, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\n \n\u201cTake them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,\u201d said he, \u201cand look at them\nwith Ad\u00e8le;\u2014you\u201d (glancing at me) \u201cresume your seat, and answer my questions. I\nperceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and some\nthought.\u201d\n \n\u201cI did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other\noccupation.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere did you get your copies?\u201d\n \n\u201cOut of my head.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat head I see now on your shoulders?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas it other furniture of the same kind within?\u201d\n \n\u201cI should think it may have: I should hope\u2014better.\u201d\n \nHe spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.\n \nWhile he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I\nmust premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen\nvividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to\nembody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in\neach case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\n \nThese pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and\nlivid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too,\nwas the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One\ngleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a\ncormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold\nbracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my\npalette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.\nSinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green\nwater; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had\nbeen washed or torn.\n \nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with\ngrass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an\nexpanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman\u2019s\nshape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The\ndim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through\nthe suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed\nshadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the\nneck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the\ntrain of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\n \nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a\nmuster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the\nhorizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,\u2014a\ncolossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin\nhands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower\nfeatures a sable veil; a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow\nand fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were\nvisible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery,\nvague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,\ngemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was \u201cthe\nlikeness of a kingly crown;\u201d what it diademed was \u201cthe shape which shape had\nnone.\u201d\n \n\u201cWere you happy when you painted these pictures?\u201d asked Mr. Rochester\npresently.\n \n\u201cI was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to\nenjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few;\nbut I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist\u2019s dreamland while you blent and\narranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?\u201d\n \n\u201cI had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from\nmorning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days\nfavoured my inclination to apply.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?\u201d\n \n\u201cFar from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork:\nin each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably.\nYou had not enough of the artist\u2019s skill and science to give it full being: yet\nthe drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are\nelfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could\nyou make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above\nquells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who\ntaught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this\nhill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings\naway!\u201d\n \nI had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, he\nsaid abruptly\u2014\n \n\u201cIt is nine o\u2019clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Ad\u00e8le sit up so\nlong? Take her to bed.\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress, but\nscarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.\n \n\u201cI wish you all good-night, now,\u201d said he, making a movement of the hand\ntowards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to\ndismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we\ncurtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.\n \n\u201cYou said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,\u201d I observed,\nwhen I rejoined her in her room, after putting Ad\u00e8le to bed.\n \n\u201cWell, is he?\u201d\n \n\u201cI think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.\u201d\n \n\u201cTrue: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his\nmanner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper,\nallowance should be made.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cPartly because it is his nature\u2014and we can none of us help our nature; and\npartly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his\nspirits unequal.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat about?\u201d\n \n\u201cFamily troubles, for one thing.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut he has no family.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot now, but he has had\u2014or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder brother a\nfew years since.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis elder brother?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the\nproperty; only about nine years.\u201d\n \n\u201cNine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as to be\nstill inconsolable for his loss?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, no\u2014perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them.\nMr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he\nprejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of money, and\nanxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the\nproperty by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have\nwealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of\nage, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of\nmischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into\nwhat he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what\nthe precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit\ncould not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke\nwith his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I\ndon\u2019t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together,\nsince the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate;\nand, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy should he shun it?\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps he thinks it gloomy.\u201d\n \nThe answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax\neither could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin\nand nature of Mr. Rochester\u2019s trials. She averred they were a mystery to\nherself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident,\nindeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.\n",
        "\nFor several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he\nseemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from\nMillcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.\nWhen his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good\ndeal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till\nlate at night.\n \nDuring this interval, even Ad\u00e8le was seldom sent for to his presence, and all\nmy acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall,\non the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and\ncoldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and\nsometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did\nnot offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation;\nthe ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\n \nOne day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order,\ndoubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a\npublic meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being\nwet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were\ngone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Ad\u00e8le were to go downstairs. I\nbrushed Ad\u00e8le\u2019s hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was\nmyself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch\u2014all being\ntoo close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement\u2014we\ndescended, Ad\u00e8le wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come;\nfor, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was\ngratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the\ndining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.\n \n\u201cMa boite! ma boite!\u201d exclaimed she, running towards it.\n \n\u201cYes, there is your \u2018boite\u2019 at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\ndaughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,\u201d said the deep\nand rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an\nimmense easy-chair at the fireside. \u201cAnd mind,\u201d he continued, \u201cdon\u2019t bother me\nwith any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of\nthe entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille,\nenfant; comprends-tu?\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to a sofa\nwith her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid. Having\nremoved this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper,\nshe merely exclaimed\u2014\n \n\u201cOh ciel! Que c\u2019est beau!\u201d and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\ncontemplation.\n \n\u201cIs Miss Eyre there?\u201d now demanded the master, half rising from his seat to\nlook round to the door, near which I still stood.\n \n\u201cAh! well, come forward; be seated here.\u201d He drew a chair near his own. \u201cI am\nnot fond of the prattle of children,\u201d he continued; \u201cfor, old bachelor as I am,\nI have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp. It would be\nintolerable to me to pass a whole evening t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a brat. Don\u2019t\ndraw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it\u2014if\nyou please, that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor\ndo I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have mine\nin mind; it won\u2019t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood\nis said to be thicker than water.\u201d\n \nHe rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,\nknitting-basket in hand.\n \n\u201cGood evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have forbidden\nAd\u00e8le to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion;\nhave the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one\nof the most benevolent acts you ever performed.\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her sofa,\nand there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen\ncontents of her \u201cboite;\u201d pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in\nsuch broken English as she was mistress of.\n \n\u201cNow I have performed the part of a good host,\u201d pursued Mr. Rochester, \u201cput my\nguests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend\nto my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward:\nyou are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in\nthis comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do.\u201d\n \nI did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the\nshade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a\nmatter of course to obey him promptly.\n \nWe were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for\ndinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all\nred and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window\nand loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Ad\u00e8le (she\ndared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain\nagainst the panes.\n \nMr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what\nI had seen him look before; not quite so stern\u2014much less gloomy. There was a\nsmile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not\nsure; but I think it very probable. He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood;\nmore expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and\nrigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his\nmassive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of\nthe fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had\ngreat, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too\u2014not without a certain change in their\ndepths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of\nthat feeling.\n \nHe had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same\nlength of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on\nhis physiognomy.\n \n\u201cYou examine me, Miss Eyre,\u201d said he: \u201cdo you think me handsome?\u201d\n \nI should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something\nconventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue\nbefore I was aware\u2014\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! By my word! there is something singular about you,\u201d said he: \u201cyou have the\nair of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit\nwith your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except,\nby-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for\ninstance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are\nobliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at\nleast brusque. What do you mean by it?\u201d\n \n\u201cSir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was\nnot easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that\ntastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of\nthat sort.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed!\nAnd so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and\nsoothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what\nfault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my\nfeatures like any other man?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed\nrepartee: it was only a blunder.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it. Criticise me: does my\nforehead not please you?\u201d\n \nHe lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and\nshowed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency\nwhere the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.\n \n\u201cNow, ma\u2019am, am I a fool?\u201d\n \n\u201cFar from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return\nwhether you are a philanthropist?\u201d\n \n\u201cThere again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head:\nand that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women\n(low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I\nbear a conscience;\u201d and he pointed to the prominences which are said to\nindicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently\nconspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head:\n\u201cand, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old\nas you, I was a feeling fellow enough; partial to the unfledged, unfostered,\nand unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me\nwith her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an\nIndia-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one\nsentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?\u201d\n \n\u201cHope of what, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?\u201d\n \n\u201cDecidedly he has had too much wine,\u201d I thought; and I did not know what answer\nto make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was capable of being\nre-transformed?\n \n\u201cYou looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any\nmore than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is\nconvenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my\nphysiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.\nYoung lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.\u201d\n \nWith this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on\nthe marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as\nhis face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length\nof limb. I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there\nwas so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such\na look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a\nreliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone\nfor the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one\ninevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put\nfaith in the confidence.\n \n\u201cI am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand\nthat is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient\ncompany for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Ad\u00e8le is\na degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am\npersuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited\nyou down here. I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours\nfrom my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what\nimportunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out\u2014to\nlearn more of you\u2014therefore speak.\u201d\n \nInstead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile\neither.\n \n\u201cSpeak,\u201d he urged.\n \n\u201cWhat about, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of\ntreating it entirely to yourself.\u201d\n \nAccordingly I sat and said nothing: \u201cIf he expects me to talk for the mere sake\nof talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong\nperson,\u201d I thought.\n \n\u201cYou are dumb, Miss Eyre.\u201d\n \nI was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty\nglance seemed to dive into my eyes.\n \n\u201cStubborn?\u201d he said, \u201cand annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an\nabsurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once\nfor all, I don\u2019t wish to treat you like an inferior: that is\u201d (correcting\nhimself), \u201cI claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years\u2019\ndifference in age and a century\u2019s advance in experience. This is legitimate,\net j\u2019y tiens, as Ad\u00e8le would say; and it is by virtue of this\nsuperiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to\nme a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one\npoint\u2014cankering as a rusty nail.\u201d\n \nHe had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible\nto his condescension, and would not seem so.\n \n\u201cI am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir\u2014quite willing; but I cannot introduce\na topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me questions, and I\nwill do my best to answer them.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a\nlittle masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated,\nnamely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through\na varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the\nglobe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?\u201d\n \n\u201cDo as you please, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive\none. Reply clearly.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are\nolder than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your\nclaim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and\nexperience.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! Promptly spoken. But I won\u2019t allow that, seeing that it would never\nsuit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both\nadvantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree\nto receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of\ncommand. Will you?\u201d\n \nI smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar\u2014he seems to\nforget that he pays me \u00a330 per annum for receiving his orders.\n \n\u201cThe smile is very well,\u201d said he, catching instantly the passing expression;\n\u201cbut speak too.\u201d\n \n\u201cI was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire\nwhether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.\u201d\n \n\u201cPaid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had\nforgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to\nlet me hector a little?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and\nthat you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I\nagree heartily.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and\nphrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather\nlike, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumbug! Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore,\nkeep to yourself, and don\u2019t venture on generalities of which you are intensely\nignorant. However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its\ninaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the\nsubstance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often\nsee such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid,\ncoarse-minded misapprehension of one\u2019s meaning are the usual rewards of\ncandour. Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have\nanswered me as you have just done. But I don\u2019t mean to flatter you: if you are\ncast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did\nit. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know,\nyou may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to\ncounterbalance your few good points.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd so may you,\u201d I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind: he\nseemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well\nas imagined\u2014\n \n\u201cYes, yes, you are right,\u201d said he; \u201cI have plenty of faults of my own: I know\nit, and I don\u2019t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I need not be too\nsevere about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of\nlife to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and\ncensures from my neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other\ndefaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse\ncircumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and\nhave never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very\ndifferent; I might have been as good as you\u2014wiser\u2014almost as stainless. I envy\nyou your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little\ngirl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure\u2014an\ninexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to\nfetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen\u2014quite your equal. Nature meant me to\nbe, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I\nam not so. You would say you don\u2019t see it; at least I flatter myself I read as\nmuch in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am\nquick at interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,\u2014I am not a\nvillain: you are not to suppose that\u2014not to attribute to me any such bad\neminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my\nnatural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty\ndissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you\nwonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life\nyou will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your\nacquaintances\u2019 secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done,\nthat it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk\nof themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of\ntheir indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting\nand encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow do you know?\u2014how can you guess all this, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cI know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my\nthoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior to\ncircumstances; so I should\u2014so I should; but you see I was not. When fate\nwronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I\ndegenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry\nribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to\nconfess that he and I are on a level. I wish I had stood firm\u2014God knows I do!\nDread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of\nlife.\u201d\n \n\u201cRepentance is said to be its cure, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform\u2014I have\nstrength yet for that\u2014if\u2014but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered,\nburdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I\nhave a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what\nit may.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you will degenerate still more, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cPossibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure? And I may get\nit as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt will sting\u2014it will taste bitter, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow do you know?\u2014you never tried it. How very serious\u2014how very solemn you\nlook: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head\u201d (taking one\nfrom the mantelpiece). \u201cYou have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that\nhave not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its\nmysteries.\u201d\n \n\u201cI only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and\nyou pronounced remorse the poison of existence.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across\nmy brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather than a\ntemptation: it was very genial, very soothing\u2014I know that. Here it comes again!\nIt is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel\nof light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my\nheart.\u201d\n \n\u201cDistrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnce more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish\nbetween a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal\nthrone\u2014between a guide and a seducer?\u201d\n \n\u201cI judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the\nsuggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more misery if\nyou listen to it.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all\u2014it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you\nare not my conscience-keeper, so don\u2019t make yourself uneasy. Here, come in,\nbonny wanderer!\u201d\n \nHe said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then,\nfolding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he seemed to\nenclose in their embrace the invisible being.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d he continued, again addressing me, \u201cI have received the pilgrim\u2014a\ndisguised deity, as I verily believe. Already it has done me good: my heart was\na sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo speak truth, sir, I don\u2019t understand you at all: I cannot keep up the\nconversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I know: you\nsaid you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your\nown imperfection;\u2014one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a\nsullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard,\nyou would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve;\nand that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts\nand actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of\nrecollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.\u201d\n \n\u201cJustly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell\nwith energy.\u201d\n \n\u201cSir?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint. Certainly,\nmy associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd better?\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd better\u2014so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt\nme; I don\u2019t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at\nthis moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that\nboth are right.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of\ncombinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is\nliable to abuse.\u201d\n \n\u201cSententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are human and fallible.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am: so are you\u2014what then?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and\nperfect alone can be safely intrusted.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat power?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,\u2014\u2018Let it be\nright.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2018Let it be right\u2019\u2014the very words: you have pronounced them.\u201d\n \n\u201cMay it be right then,\u201d I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to\ncontinue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that\nthe character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond\nits present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity,\nwhich accompanies a conviction of ignorance.\n \n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo put Ad\u00e8le to bed: it is past her bedtime.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.\u201d\n \n\u201cYour language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly\nnot afraid.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are afraid\u2014your self-love dreads a blunder.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn that sense I do feel apprehensive\u2014I have no wish to talk nonsense.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for\nsense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don\u2019t trouble yourself to answer\u2014I see\nyou laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not\nnaturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint\nstill clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice,\nand restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a\nbrother\u2014or father, or master, or what you will\u2014to smile too gaily, speak too\nfreely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural\nwith me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your\nlooks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer\nnow. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the\nclose-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it\nbut free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt has struck nine, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind,\u2014wait a minute: Ad\u00e8le is not ready to go to bed yet. My position,\nMiss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours\nobservation. While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Ad\u00e8le (I\nhave my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,\u2014reasons that I may, nay,\nthat I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten\nminutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it;\ncoquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of\nher bones. \u2018Il faut que je l\u2019essaie!\u2019 cried she, \u2018et \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame!\u2019 and she\nrushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in\na few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,\u2014a miniature of\nC\u00e9line Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of\u2014But never\nmind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is\nmy presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.\u201d\n \nEre long, Ad\u00e8le\u2019s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She entered,\ntransformed as her guardian had predicted. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very\nshort, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown\nfrock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her\nfeet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.\n \n\u201cEst-ce que ma robe va bien?\u201d cried she, bounding forwards; \u201cet mes souliers?\net mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!\u201d\n \nAnd spreading out her dress, she chass\u00e9ed across the room till, having reached\nMr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on\none knee at his feet, exclaiming\u2014\n \n\u201cMonsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bont\u00e9;\u201d then rising, she added,\n\u201cC\u2019est comme cela que maman faisait, n\u2019est-ce pas, monsieur?\u201d\n \n\u201cPre-cise-ly!\u201d was the answer; \u201cand, \u2018comme cela,\u2019 she charmed my English gold\nout of my British breeches\u2019 pocket. I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,\u2014ay,\ngrass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. My\nSpring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands,\nwhich, in some moods, I would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence\nit sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could\nmanure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so\nartificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic\nprinciple of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I\u2019ll\nexplain all this some day. Good-night.\u201d\n",
        "\nMr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one afternoon, when\nhe chanced to meet me and Ad\u00e8le in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot\nand her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within\nsight of her.\n \nHe then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, C\u00e9line Varens,\ntowards whom he had once cherished what he called a \u201cgrande passion.\u201d\nThis passion C\u00e9line had professed to return with even superior ardour. He\nthought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that she\npreferred his \u201ctaille d\u2019athl\u00e8te\u201d to the elegance of the Apollo\nBelvidere.\n \n\u201cAnd, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph\nfor her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete\nestablishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c.\nIn short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any\nother spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to\nshame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to\ndeviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had\u2014as I deserved to have\u2014the fate of\nall other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when C\u00e9line did not expect\nme, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling\nthrough Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air\nconsecrated so lately by her presence. No,\u2014I exaggerate; I never thought there\nwas any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume\nshe had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just\nbeginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled\nessences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the\nbalcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The\nbalcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,\u2014I\nwill take one now, if you will excuse me.\u201d\n \nHere ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having\nplaced it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing\nand sunless air, he went on\u2014\n \n\u201cI liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was\ncroquant\u2014(overlook the barbarism)\u2014croquant chocolate comfits, and\nsmoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the\nfashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant\nclose carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen\nin the brilliant city-night, I recognised the \u2018voiture\u2019 I had given C\u00e9line. She\nwas returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron\nrails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door;\nmy flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed\nin a cloak\u2014an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening\u2014I\nknew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her\ndress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over the balcony, I was\nabout to murmur \u2018Mon ange\u2019\u2014in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the\near of love alone\u2014when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; cloaked\nalso; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was\na hatted head which now passed under the arched porte coch\u00e8re of the\nhotel.\n \n\u201cYou never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask\nyou; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to experience:\nyour soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it. You think\nall existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has\nhitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither\nsee the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the\nbreakers boil at their base. But I tell you\u2014and you may mark my words\u2014you will\ncome some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life\u2019s stream\nwill be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be\ndashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave\ninto a calmer current\u2014as I am now.\n \n\u201cI like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness\nof the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its\nretirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey fa\u00e7ade, and\nlines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I\nabhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house? How I do\nstill abhor\u2014\u201d\n \nHe ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his boot\nagainst the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and\nto hold him so tightly that he could not advance.\n \nWe were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.\nLifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I never\nsaw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed\nmomentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his\nebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another\nfeeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and\nresolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he went on\u2014\n \n\u201cDuring the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my\ndestiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk\u2014a hag like one of those who\nappeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. \u2018You like Thornfield?\u2019 she said,\nlifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid\nhieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of\nwindows, \u2018Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!\u2019\n \n\u201c\u2018I will like it,\u2019 said I; \u2018I dare like it;\u2019 and\u201d (he subjoined moodily) \u201cI\nwill keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness\u2014yes,\ngoodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job\u2019s\nleviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others\ncount as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood.\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le here ran before him with her shuttlecock. \u201cAway!\u201d he cried harshly; \u201ckeep\nat a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!\u201d Continuing then to pursue his walk\nin silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence he had abruptly\ndiverged\u2014\n \n\u201cDid you leave the balcony, sir,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhen Mdlle. Varens entered?\u201d\n \nI almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the\ncontrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes towards\nme, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. \u201cOh, I had forgotten C\u00e9line!\nWell, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier,\nI seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating\ncoils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in\ntwo minutes to my heart\u2019s core. Strange!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly starting again\nfrom the point. \u201cStrange that I should choose you for the confidant of all\nthis, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if\nit were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of\nhis opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you! But the last\nsingularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your\ngravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.\nBesides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own:\nI know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a\nunique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take\nharm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot\nblight you, you may refresh me.\u201d After this digression he proceeded\u2014\n \n\u201cI remained in the balcony. \u2018They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,\u2019 thought\nI: \u2018let me prepare an ambush.\u2019 So putting my hand in through the open window, I\ndrew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take\nobservations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to\nfurnish an outlet to lovers\u2019 whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and\nas I resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. C\u00e9line\u2019s\nchamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The\ncouple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there\nwas \u2018the Varens,\u2019 shining in satin and jewels,\u2014my gifts of course,\u2014and there\nwas her companion in an officer\u2019s uniform; and I knew him for a young rou\u00e9 of a\nvicomte\u2014a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and\nhad never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely. On\nrecognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because\nat the same moment my love for C\u00e9line sank under an extinguisher. A woman who\ncould betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved\nonly scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.\n \n\u201cThey began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,\nmercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than\nenrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived,\nbrought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed energy or wit to\nbelabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their\nlittle way: especially C\u00e9line, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal\ndefects\u2014deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to launch out\ninto fervent admiration of what she called my \u2018beaut\u00e9 m\u00e2le:\u2019 wherein she\ndiffered diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second\ninterview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the\ntime and\u2014\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le here came running up again.\n \n\u201cMonsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to\nsee you.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon them;\nliberated C\u00e9line from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel;\noffered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics,\nprayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a\nmeeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of\nencountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as\nthe wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole\ncrew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette\nAd\u00e8le, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see\nno proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like\nme than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her\nchild, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no\nnatural claim on Ad\u00e8le\u2019s part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge\nany, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e\u2019en\ntook the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it\nhere, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs.\nFairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate\noffspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your\npost and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have\nfound another place\u2014that you beg me to look out for a new governess,\n&c.\u2014Eh?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: Ad\u00e8le is not answerable for either her mother\u2019s faults or yours: I have a\nregard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parentless\u2014forsaken by\nher mother and disowned by you, sir\u2014I shall cling closer to her than before.\nHow could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate\nher governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her\nas a friend?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you\ntoo: it darkens.\u201d\n \nBut I stayed out a few minutes longer with Ad\u00e8le and Pilot\u2014ran a race with her,\nand played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went in, and I had\nremoved her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour,\nallowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms\nand trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which\nbetrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her\nmother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I\nwas disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in\nher countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no\ntrait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she\ncould but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.\n \nIt was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I\nsteadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was\nprobably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself:\na wealthy Englishman\u2019s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him,\nwere every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something\ndecidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when\nhe was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his\nnewly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated\nwonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the\npresent inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master\u2019s manner to\nmyself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to\nmy discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for\nsome weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in\nhis way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly,\nthe encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for\nme: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a\ncordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse\nhim, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as\nfor my benefit.\n \nI, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. It\nwas his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted\nwith the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt\nscenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale\non which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were\ncharacterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered,\nin imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought\nthrough the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious\nallusion.\n \nThe ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness,\nas correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him. I felt at\ntimes as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious\nsometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so\ngratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to\npine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of\nexistence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and\nstrength.\n \nAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many\nassociations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked\nto see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I\nhad not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them\nfrequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every\ndescription: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was\nbalanced by unjust severity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably\nso; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his\nlibrary alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a\nmorose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that\nhis moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say\nformer, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some\ncruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies,\nhigher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed,\neducation instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent\nmaterials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled\nand tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and\nwould have given much to assuage it.\n \nThough I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not\nsleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told how his\ndestiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at Thornfield.\n \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked myself. \u201cWhat alienates him from the house? Will he leave it\nagain soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at\na time; and he has now been resident eight weeks. If he does go, the change\nwill be doleful. Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how\njoyless sunshine and fine days will seem!\u201d\n \nI hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I\nstarted wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which\nsounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the\nnight was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in bed,\nlistening. The sound was hushed.\n \nI tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was\nbroken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed my\nchamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way\nalong the dark gallery outside. I said, \u201cWho is there?\u201d Nothing answered. I was\nchilled with fear.\n \nAll at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door\nchanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of\nMr. Rochester\u2019s chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings. The\nidea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an\nunbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the\nreturn of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream\nhad scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a\nmarrow-freezing incident enough.\n \nThis was a demoniac laugh\u2014low, suppressed, and deep\u2014uttered, as it seemed, at\nthe very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was near the door, and\nI thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside\u2014or rather, crouched\nby my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I\nstill gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind\nthe panels. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to\ncry out, \u201cWho is there?\u201d\n \nSomething gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards\nthe third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that\nstaircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\n \n\u201cWas that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?\u201d thought I.\nImpossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried\non my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a\ntrembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in\nthe gallery. I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed\nto perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to\nthe right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became\nfurther aware of a strong smell of burning.\n \nSomething creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester\u2019s, and\nthe smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I\nthought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the\nchamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In\nthe midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep\nsleep.\n \n\u201cWake! wake!\u201d I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the smoke\nhad stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I\nrushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and\nboth were filled with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its\noccupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the\ncouch afresh, and, by God\u2019s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which\nwere devouring it.\n \nThe hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from\nmy hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I\nhad liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. Though it was now dark, I\nknew he was awake; because I heard him fulminating strange anathemas at finding\nhimself lying in a pool of water.\n \n\u201cIs there a flood?\u201d he cried.\n \n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I answered; \u201cbut there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched\nnow; I will fetch you a candle.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cWhat have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the room besides you?\nHave you plotted to drown me?\u201d\n \n\u201cI will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven\u2019s name, get up. Somebody has\nplotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes\ntill I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be\u2014yes, here is my\ndressing-gown. Now run!\u201d\n \nI did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He took it\nfrom my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the\nsheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\n \n\u201cWhat is it? and who did it?\u201d he asked.\n \nI briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in\nthe gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,\u2014the smell of\nfire which had conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters\nthere, and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.\n \nHe listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than\nastonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.\n \n\u201cShall I call Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cMrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she do? Let\nher sleep unmolested.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm enough,\nyou may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair:\nthere,\u2014I will put it on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of\nthe wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain\nwhere you are till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the\nsecond storey. Don\u2019t move, remember, or call any one.\u201d\n \nHe went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very softly,\nunclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after\nhim, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for\nsome noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was\ncold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I\nwas not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester\u2019s\ndispleasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on\nthe gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. \u201cI hope it is\nhe,\u201d thought I, \u201cand not something worse.\u201d\n \nHe re-entered, pale and very gloomy. \u201cI have found it all out,\u201d said he,\nsetting his candle down on the washstand; \u201cit is as I thought.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow, sir?\u201d\n \nHe made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground. At the\nend of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone\u2014\n \n\u201cI forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think,\nor something like it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,\u2014she laughs in\nthat way. She is a singular person.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust so. Grace Poole\u2014you have guessed it. She is, as you say, singular\u2014very.\nWell, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad that you are the only\nperson, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night\u2019s\nincident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it. I will account for\nthis state of affairs\u201d (pointing to the bed): \u201cand now return to your own room.\nI shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It\nis near four:\u2014in two hours the servants will be up.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-night, then, sir,\u201d said I, departing.\n \nHe seemed surprised\u2014very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to go.\n \n\u201cWhat!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201care you quitting me already, and in that way?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou said I might go, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and\ngood-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, you have saved my\nlife!\u2014snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! and you walk past me\nas if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.\u201d\n \nHe held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in both\nhis own.\n \n\u201cYou have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I\ncannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in\nthe character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;\u2014I\nfeel your benefits no burden, Jane.\u201d\n \nHe paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,\u2014but his\nvoice was checked.\n \n\u201cGood-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the\ncase.\u201d\n \n\u201cI knew,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou would do me good in some way, at some time;\u2014I saw\nit in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did\nnot\u201d\u2014(again he stopped)\u2014\u201cdid not\u201d (he proceeded hastily) \u201cstrike delight to my\nvery inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies; I have\nheard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My\ncherished preserver, good-night!\u201d\n \nStrange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.\n \n\u201cI am glad I happened to be awake,\u201d I said: and then I was going.\n \n\u201cWhat! you will go?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am cold, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cCold? Yes,\u2014and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!\u201d But he still retained\nmy hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an expedient.\n \n\u201cI think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,\u201d said I.\n \n\u201cWell, leave me:\u201d he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.\n \nI regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I was\ntossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under\nsurges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet\nas the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope,\nbore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even\nin fancy\u2014a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.\nSense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest,\nI rose as soon as day dawned.\n",
        "\nI both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this\nsleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye.\nDuring the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was\nnot in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a\nfew minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it\nthat day.\n \nBut the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet\ncourse of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in\nthe neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester\u2019s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s voice, and Leah\u2019s,\nand the cook\u2019s\u2014that is, John\u2019s wife\u2014and even John\u2019s own gruff tones. There were\nexclamations of \u201cWhat a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!\u201d \u201cIt is always\ndangerous to keep a candle lit at night.\u201d \u201cHow providential that he had\npresence of mind to think of the water-jug!\u201d \u201cI wonder he waked nobody!\u201d \u201cIt is\nto be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,\u201d &c.\n \nTo much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and\nwhen I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open\ndoor that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped\nof its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass\ndimmed with smoke. I was about to address her, for I wished to know what\naccount had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person\nin the chamber\u2014a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to\nnew curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.\n \nThere she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown,\nher check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in\nwhich her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her\ncommonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one\nwould have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted\nmurder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and\n(as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was\namazed\u2014confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no\nincrease or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear\nof detection. She said \u201cGood morning, Miss,\u201d in her usual phlegmatic and brief\nmanner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.\n \n\u201cI will put her to some test,\u201d thought I: \u201csuch absolute impenetrability is\npast comprehension.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood morning, Grace,\u201d I said. \u201cHas anything happened here? I thought I heard\nthe servants all talking together a while ago.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his\ncandle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the\nbed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with\nthe water in the ewer.\u201d\n \n\u201cA strange affair!\u201d I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly\u2014\u201cDid\nMr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?\u201d\n \nShe again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of\nconsciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she\nanswered\u2014\n \n\u201cThe servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to\nhear. Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room and yours are the nearest to master\u2019s; but Mrs.\nFairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep\nheavy.\u201d She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but\nstill in a marked and significant tone\u2014\u201cBut you are young, Miss; and I should\nsay a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?\u201d\n \n\u201cI did,\u201d said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the\npanes, could not hear me, \u201cand at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot\ncannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.\u201d\n \nShe took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle\nwith a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure\u2014\n \n\u201cIt is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he was in\nsuch danger: You must have been dreaming.\u201d\n \n\u201cI was not dreaming,\u201d I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\nprovoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\nconscious eye.\n \n\u201cHave you told master that you heard a laugh?\u201d she inquired.\n \n\u201cI have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?\u201d she\nfurther asked.\n \nShe appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information\nunawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her\nguilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it\nadvisable to be on my guard.\n \n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said I, \u201cI bolted my door.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get\ninto bed?\u201d\n \n\u201cFiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!\u201d\nIndignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, \u201cHitherto I have\noften omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary. I was not aware\nany danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future\u201d\n(and I laid marked stress on the words) \u201cI shall take good care to make all\nsecure before I venture to lie down.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt will be wise so to do,\u201d was her answer: \u201cthis neighbourhood is as quiet as\nany I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it\nwas a house; though there are hundreds of pounds\u2019 worth of plate in the\nplate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are\nvery few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does\ncome, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best\nto err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a\ndrawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people,\nMiss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not\ndispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used\ndiscreetly.\u201d And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered\nwith the demureness of a Quakeress.\n \nI still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous\nself-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.\n \n\u201cMrs. Poole,\u201d said she, addressing Grace, \u201cthe servants\u2019 dinner will soon be\nready: will you come down?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I\u2019ll carry it\nupstairs.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll have some meat?\u201d\n \n\u201cJust a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the sago?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I\u2019ll make it\nmyself.\u201d\n \nThe cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me: so I\ndeparted.\n \nI hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s account of the curtain conflagration during\ndinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical\ncharacter of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her\nposition at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody\nthat morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master\u2019s service. He\nhad almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night:\nwhat mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me,\ntoo, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman\nseemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so much in\nher power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not\nopenly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.\n \nHad Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that\ntenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf;\nbut, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted.\n\u201cYet,\u201d I reflected, \u201cshe has been young once; her youth would be contemporary\nwith her master\u2019s: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I\ndon\u2019t think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may\npossess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of\npersonal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:\nGrace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to\na nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and\nshe now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own\nindiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?\u201d But, having\nreached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole\u2019s square, flat figure, and\nuncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind\u2019s eye, that\nI thought, \u201cNo; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,\u201d suggested\nthe secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, \u201cyou are not\nbeautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have\noften felt as if he did; and last night\u2014remember his words; remember his look;\nremember his voice!\u201d\n \nI well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly\nrenewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Ad\u00e8le was drawing; I bent over her and\ndirected her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.\n \n\u201cQu\u2019avez-vous, mademoiselle?\u201d said she. \u201cVos doigts tremblent comme la feuille,\net vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!\u201d\n \n\u201cI am hot, Ad\u00e8le, with stooping!\u201d She went on sketching; I went on thinking.\n \nI hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving\nrespecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her, and found\nwe were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke\ntruth\u2014I was a lady. And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me;\nI had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had\nbrighter hopes and keener enjoyments.\n \n\u201cEvening approaches,\u201d said I, as I looked towards the window. \u201cI have never\nheard Mr. Rochester\u2019s voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see\nhim before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because\nexpectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.\u201d\n \nWhen dusk actually closed, and when Ad\u00e8le left me to go and play in the nursery\nwith Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring\nbelow; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I\nheard Mr. Rochester\u2019s own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open\nand admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the\nwindow. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o\u2019clock,\nand it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night,\nwhen I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the\nsubject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him\nplainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night\u2019s hideous\nattempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered\nwhether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing\nhim by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always\nprevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never\nventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every\nminute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him\nin argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.\n \nA tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it was\nonly to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room. Thither I repaired,\nglad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr.\nRochester\u2019s presence.\n \n\u201cYou must want your tea,\u201d said the good lady, as I joined her; \u201cyou ate so\nlittle at dinner. I am afraid,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou are not well to-day: you\nlook flushed and feverish.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, quite well! I never felt better.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot\nwhile I knit off this needle?\u201d Having completed her task, she rose to draw down\nthe blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the\nmost of daylight, though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity.\n \n\u201cIt is fair to-night,\u201d said she, as she looked through the panes, \u201cthough not\nstarlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his\njourney.\u201d\n \n\u201cJourney!\u2014Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas, Mr.\nEshton\u2019s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe there is quite\na party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and\nothers.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you expect him back to-night?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or\nmore: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded\nby elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and\nentertain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen especially are often in\nrequest on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in\nsociety, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of\nhim; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him\nparticularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities,\nperhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre there ladies at the Leas?\u201d\n \n\u201cThere are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters\u2014very elegant young ladies\nindeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful\nwomen, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when\nshe was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr.\nRochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day\u2014how richly it was\ndecorated, how brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and\ngentlemen present\u2014all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was\nconsidered the belle of the evening.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was\nChristmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some\nof the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat\ndown in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the\nladies were magnificently dressed; most of them\u2014at least most of the younger\nones\u2014looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what was she like?\u201d\n \n\u201cTall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion,\ndark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester\u2019s: large and\nblack, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of\nhair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind,\nand in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in\npure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her\nbreast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.\nShe wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with\nthe jetty mass of her curls.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe was greatly admired, of course?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments. She was\none of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and\nMr. Rochester sang a duet.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?\u201d\n \n\u201cA very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen\nto her;\u2014and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester\nis; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes.\nOld Lord Ingram\u2019s estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for\neverything almost.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her: Mr.\nRochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester\nis nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat of that? More unequal matches are made every day.\u201d\n \n\u201cTrue: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the\nsort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?\u201d\n \nI was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester\nand the beautiful Blanche; but Ad\u00e8le came in, and the conversation was turned\ninto another channel.\n \nWhen once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into my\nheart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a\nstrict hand such as had been straying through imagination\u2019s boundless and\ntrackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.\n \nArraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes, wishes,\nsentiments I had been cherishing since last night\u2014of the general state of mind\nin which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason having come forward\nand told, in her own quiet way, a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had\nrejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;\u2014I pronounced judgment to\nthis effect:\u2014\n \nThat a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that\na more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies, and swallowed\npoison as if it were nectar.\n \n\u201cYou,\u201d I said, \u201ca favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted with\nthe power of pleasing him? You of importance to him in any way? Go! your\nfolly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of\npreference\u2014equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the\nworld to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!\u2014Could not\neven self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the\nbrief scene of last night?\u2014Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in\npraise of your eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on\nyour own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by\nher superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all\nwomen to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and\nunknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded\nto, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no\nextrication.\n \n\u201cListen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before\nyou, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one\ndefect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write\nunder it, \u2018Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.\u2019\n \n\u201cAfterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory\u2014you have one prepared in your\ndrawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints;\nchoose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest\nface you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines,\naccording to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember\nthe raven ringlets, the oriental eye;\u2014What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a\nmodel! Order! No snivel!\u2014no sentiment!\u2014no regret! I will endure only sense and\nresolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and\nbust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit\nneither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,\na\u00ebrial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it\n\u2018Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.\u2019\n \n\u201cWhenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of\nyou, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, \u2018Mr. Rochester might\nprobably win that noble lady\u2019s love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely\nhe would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew calm,\nand fell asleep.\n \nI kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons;\nand in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary\nBlanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real\nhead in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-control could desire. I\nderived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had\ngiven force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on\nmy heart.\n \nEre long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome\ndiscipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I\nwas able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they\nfound me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even\nexternally.\n",
        "\nA week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still he did\nnot come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go\nstraight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his\nface again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it\nin a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning\nto feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting\nmyself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,\nand recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it\nwas wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder\u2014how I cleared up the mistake\nof supposing Mr. Rochester\u2019s movements a matter in which I had any cause to\ntake a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of\ninferiority: on the contrary, I just said\u2014\n \n\u201cYou have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive\nthe salary he gives you for teaching his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and to be grateful for such\nrespectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to\nexpect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges\nbetween you and him; so don\u2019t make him the object of your fine feelings, your\nraptures, agonies, and so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste,\nand be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and\nstrength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.\u201d\n \nI went on with my day\u2019s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague\nsuggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit\nThornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering\nconjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they\nmight germinate and bear fruit if they could.\n \nMr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought\nMrs. Fairfax a letter.\n \n\u201cIt is from the master,\u201d said she, as she looked at the direction. \u201cNow I\nsuppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.\u201d\n \nAnd while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my\ncoffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that\ncircumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand shook,\nand why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did\nnot choose to consider.\n \n\u201cWell, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy\nenough now: for a little while at least,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the\nnote before her spectacles.\n \nEre I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Ad\u00e8le\u2019s\npinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to another bun and\nrefilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly\u2014\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed he is\u2014in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone\neither. I don\u2019t know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with\nhim: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the\nlibrary and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands\nfrom the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies\nwill bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full\nhouse of it.\u201d And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to\ncommence operations.\n \nThe three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the\nrooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was\nmistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such\nwashing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of\npictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in\nbedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld,\neither before or since. Ad\u00e8le ran quite wild in the midst of it: the\npreparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her\ninto ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her \u201ctoilettes,\u201d as she\ncalled frocks; to furbish up any that were \u201cpass\u00e9es,\u201d and to air and\narrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front\nchambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up\nbolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From\nschool duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service,\nand I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her and the cook;\nlearning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and\ngarnish desert-dishes.\n \nThe party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at\nsix. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I\nbelieve I was as active and gay as anybody\u2014Ad\u00e8le excepted. Still, now and then,\nI received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself,\nthrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This\nwas when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had\nalways been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace\nPoole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide\nalong the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her\nlook into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,\u2014just say a word, perhaps, to the\ncharwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble\nmantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would\nthus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe\non the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her\nprivate solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the\ntwenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her\ntime was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there\nshe sat and sewed\u2014and probably laughed drearily to herself,\u2014as companionless as\na prisoner in his dungeon.\n \nThe strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,\nnoticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her position\nor employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, indeed,\noverheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which\nGrace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and\nthe charwoman remarked\u2014\n \n\u201cShe gets good wages, I guess?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Leah; \u201cI wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\nof,\u2014there\u2019s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they\u2019re not one fifth of the sum\nMrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank\nat Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her\nindependent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she\u2019s got used to the place;\nand then she\u2019s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon\nfor her to give up business.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is a good hand, I daresay,\u201d said the charwoman.\n \n\u201cAh!\u2014she understands what she has to do,\u2014nobody better,\u201d rejoined Leah\nsignificantly; \u201cand it is not every one could fill her shoes\u2014not for all the\nmoney she gets.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat it is not!\u201d was the reply. \u201cI wonder whether the master\u2014\u201d\n \nThe charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she\ninstantly gave her companion a nudge.\n \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t she know?\u201d I heard the woman whisper.\n \nLeah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I had\ngathered from it amounted to this,\u2014that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and\nthat from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.\n \nThursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were\nlaid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet\ntables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and\nsaloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them. The hall, too, was\nscoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the\nstaircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the\nsideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir,\nvases of exotics bloomed on all sides.\n \nAfternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves,\nand her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company,\u2014to conduct the\nladies to their rooms, &c. Ad\u00e8le, too, would be dressed: though I thought\nshe had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least.\nHowever, to please her, I allowed Sophie to apparel her in one of her short,\nfull muslin frocks. For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not\nbe called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now\nbecome to me,\u2014\u201ca very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.\u201d\n \nIt had been a mild, serene spring day\u2014one of those days which, towards the end\nof March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of\nsummer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat\nat work in the schoolroom with the window open.\n \n\u201cIt gets late,\u201d said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. \u201cI am glad I\nordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past\nsix now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the\nroad: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.\u201d She\nwent to the window. \u201cHere he is!\u201d said she. \u201cWell, John\u201d (leaning out), \u201cany\nnews?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re coming, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the answer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here in ten minutes.\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so\nthat, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\n \nThe ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard;\nfour equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages.\nFluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers\nwere young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his\nblack horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and\nhe and she were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept\nthe ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent\nfolds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\n \n\u201cMiss Ingram!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.\n \nThe cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of\nthe house, and I lost sight of it. Ad\u00e8le now petitioned to go down; but I took\nher on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not on any account\nthink of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time,\nunless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c.\n\u201cSome natural tears she shed\u201d on being told this; but as I began to look very\ngrave, she consented at last to wipe them.\n \nA joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen\u2019s deep tones and ladies\u2019\nsilvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all,\nthough not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall,\nwelcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended\nthe stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful\nlaughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.\n \n\u201cElles changent de toilettes,\u201d said Ad\u00e8le; who, listening attentively, had\nfollowed every movement; and she sighed.\n \n\u201cChez maman,\u201d said she, \u201cquand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au\nsalon et \u00e0 leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer\net habiller les dames, et c\u2019\u00e9tait si amusant: comme cela on apprend.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel hungry, Ad\u00e8le?\u201d\n \n\u201cMais oui, mademoiselle: voil\u00e0 cinq ou six heures que nous n\u2019avons pas mang\u00e9.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and get you\nsomething to eat.\u201d\n \nAnd issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which\nconducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and commotion;\nthe soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over\nher crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion.\nIn the servants\u2019 hall two coachmen and three gentlemen\u2019s gentlemen stood or sat\nround the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses;\nthe new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about\neverywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took\npossession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a\nknife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the\ngallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum\nwarned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not\nproceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the\nrisk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this\nend, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and\ntwilight gathering.\n \nPresently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came\nout gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a\nmoment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery,\nconversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the\nstaircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their\ncollective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such\nas I had never before received.\n \nI found Ad\u00e8le peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar. \u201cWhat\nbeautiful ladies!\u201d cried she in English. \u201cOh, I wish I might go to them! Do you\nthink Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-by, after dinner?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, indeed, I don\u2019t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never\nmind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your\ndinner.\u201d\n \nShe was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her attention\nfor a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I, and Sophie, to\nwhom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no\ndinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The\ndessert was not carried out till after nine; and at ten footmen were still\nrunning to and fro with trays and coffee-cups. I allowed Ad\u00e8le to sit up much\nlater than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the\ndoors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she\nadded, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed;\n\u201cet alors quel dommage!\u201d\n \nI told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I\ntook her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to\nlook over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards.\nWhen the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the\ndrawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Ad\u00e8le and I sat down on the\ntop step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones\nof the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The\nsolo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur\nfilled up the intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was\nwholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate\namidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught\nthem, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered\nby distance inarticulate, into words.\n \nThe clock struck eleven. I looked at Ad\u00e8le, whose head leant against my\nshoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried\nher off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their\nchambers.\n \nThe next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an\nexcursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out early in the\nforenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the\ndeparture and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian;\nand, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart\nfrom the rest. I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was\nstanding at the window with me\u2014\n \n\u201cYou said it was not likely they should think of being married,\u201d said I, \u201cbut\nyou see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd she him,\u201d I added; \u201clook how she leans her head towards him as if she were\nconversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have never had a\nglimpse of it yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will see her this evening,\u201d answered Mrs. Fairfax. \u201cI happened to remark\nto Mr. Rochester how much Ad\u00e8le wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he\nsaid: \u2018Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss\nEyre to accompany her.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,\u201d I answered.\n \n\u201cWell, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not think\nyou would like appearing before so gay a party\u2014all strangers; and he replied,\nin his quick way\u2014\u2018Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish;\nand if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cI will not give him that trouble,\u201d I answered. \u201cI will go, if no better may\nbe; but I don\u2019t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I\u2019ll tell you how to manage so as\nto avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most\ndisagreeable part of the business. You must go into the drawing-room while it\nis empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any\nquiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless\nyou please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away\u2014nobody\nwill notice you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWill these people remain long, do you think?\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter recess, Sir\nGeorge Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to\ntown and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it\nsurprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.\u201d\n \nIt was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to\nrepair with my charge to the drawing-room. Ad\u00e8le had been in a state of ecstasy\nall day, after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the evening;\nand it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she\nsobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by\nthe time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her\npink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she\nlooked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:\nwhen she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care\npreviously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and\nassured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my\nbest dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple\u2019s wedding, and never\nworn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the\npearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.\n \nFortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through\nthe saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the apartment vacant;\na large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in\nbright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned.\nThe crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this\ndrapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a\nkey that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing\nmurmur.\n \nAd\u00e8le, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising\nimpression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her. I\nretired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to\nread. Ad\u00e8le brought her stool to my feet; ere long she touched my knee.\n \n\u201cWhat is it, Ad\u00e8le?\u201d\n \n\u201cEst-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\nmademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou think too much of your \u2018toilette,\u2019 Ad\u00e8le: but you may have a flower.\u201d And\nI took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of\nineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full. I turned my\nface away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something\nludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne\u2019s earnest and innate\ndevotion to matters of dress.\n \nA soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the\narch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down\nlight on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long\ntable; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain\nfell behind them.\n \nThere were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\nimpression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were\ndressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to\nmagnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curtseyed to\nthem: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.\n \nThey dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of\ntheir movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves\nin half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the\ntables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round\nthe fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I\nknew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.\n \nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evidently been a\nhandsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her daughters, the eldest,\nAmy, was rather little: na\u00efve, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant\nin form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well. The second,\nLouisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that\norder the French term minois chiffon\u00e9: both sisters were fair as lilies.\n \nLady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very\nhaughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her dark\nhair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet\nof a band of gems.\n \nMrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She had a\nslight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her\nscarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the\nrainbow radiance of the titled dame.\n \nBut the three most distinguished\u2014partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures\nof the band\u2014were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary.\nThey were all three of the loftiest stature of women. The Dowager might be\nbetween forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at\nleast) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people\nwould have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt,\nphysically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable\nhaughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double\nchin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me\nnot only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was\nsustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural\nerectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs.\nReed\u2019s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was deep, its inflections\nvery pompous, very dogmatical,\u2014very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet\nrobe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I\nsuppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.\n \nBlanche and Mary were of equal stature,\u2014straight and tall as poplars. Mary was\ntoo slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded her,\nof course, with special interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance\naccorded with Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s description; secondly, whether it at all resembled\nthe fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly\u2014it will out!\u2014whether it\nwere such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester\u2019s taste.\n \nAs far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture and\nMrs. Fairfax\u2019s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful\nneck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;\u2014but her face? Her face\nwas like her mother\u2019s; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the\nsame high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride!\nshe laughed continually; her laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual\nexpression of her arched and haughty lip.\n \nGenius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a\ngenius, but she was self-conscious\u2014remarkably self-conscious indeed. She\nentered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs.\nDent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers,\n\u201cespecially wild ones;\u201d Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with\nan air. I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed)\ntrailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance; her trail\nmight be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her\nexecution was brilliant; she sang: her voice was fine; she talked French apart\nto her mamma; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.\n \nMary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too,\nand a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)\u2014but Mary was\ndeficient in life: her face lacked expression, her eye lustre; she had nothing\nto say, and having once taken her seat, remained fixed like a statue in its\nniche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.\n \nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely\nto make? I could not tell\u2014I did not know his taste in female beauty. If he\nliked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then she was\naccomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that\nhe did admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove\nthe last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.\n \nYou are not to suppose, reader, that Ad\u00e8le has all this time been sitting\nmotionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she rose,\nadvanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity\u2014\n \n\u201cBon jour, mesdames.\u201d\n \nAnd Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed, \u201cOh,\nwhat a little puppet!\u201d\n \nLady Lynn had remarked, \u201cIt is Mr. Rochester\u2019s ward, I suppose\u2014the little\nFrench girl he was speaking of.\u201d\n \nMrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and Louisa\nEshton had cried out simultaneously\u2014\n \n\u201cWhat a love of a child!\u201d\n \nAnd then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced between\nthem, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only\nthe young ladies\u2019 attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting\nspoilt to her heart\u2019s content.\n \nAt last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in the\nshade\u2014if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\nwindow-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The collective\nappearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they\nare all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young. Henry and\nFrederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine\nsoldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like:\nhis hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him\nsomething of the appearance of a \u201cp\u00e8re noble de th\u00e9\u00e2tre.\u201d Lord Ingram, like his\nsisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary\u2019s\napathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity\nof blood or vigour of brain.\n \nAnd where is Mr. Rochester?\n \nHe comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I try to\nconcentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I\nam forming\u2014I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the\nsilver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold\nhis figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I\nhad rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my\nhand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart\nfull and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I\napproached him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change\nhis and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!\nSo far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me. I did not\nwonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the\nroom, and began conversing with some of the ladies.\n \nNo sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might\ngaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face;\nI could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would\nfix on him. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,\u2014a precious yet\npoignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like\nwhat the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has\ncrept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\n \nMost true is it that \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the gazer.\u201d My master\u2019s\ncolourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep\neyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,\u2014all energy, decision, will,\u2014were not\nbeautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they\nwere full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me,\u2014that took my\nfeelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love\nhim; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of\nlove there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they\nspontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at\nme.\n \nI compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the\nlanguid elegance of Lord Ingram,\u2014even the military distinction of Colonel Dent,\ncontrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power? I had no sympathy in\ntheir appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers\nwould call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.\nRochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile,\nlaugh\u2014it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their\nsmile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr.\nRochester smile:\u2014his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and\ngentle, its ray both searching and sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to\nLouisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which\nseemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to\nrise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. \u201cHe is\nnot to them what he is to me,\u201d I thought: \u201che is not of their kind. I believe\nhe is of mine;\u2014I am sure he is\u2014I feel akin to him\u2014I understand the language of\nhis countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have\nsomething in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me\nmentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him\nbut to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in\nany other light than as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good,\ntrue, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must\nconceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care\nmuch for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have\nhis force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have\ncertain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat\ncontinually that we are for ever sundered:\u2014and yet, while I breathe and think,\nI must love him.\u201d\n \nCoffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively\nas larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue\non politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady\nIngram, confabulate together. Sir George\u2014whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to\ndescribe,\u2014a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before\ntheir sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick\nLynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of\na splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little.\nThe tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of\nthe little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a\nwren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken\npossession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Ad\u00e8le shares it with him: he is\ntrying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom\nwill Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending\ngracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait\ntoo long: she herself selects a mate.\n \nMr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as\nshe stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite\nside of the mantelpiece.\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?\u201d\n \n\u201cNor am I.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?\u201d\n(pointing to Ad\u00e8le). \u201cWhere did you pick her up?\u201d\n \n\u201cI did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou should have sent her to school.\u201d\n \n\u201cI could not afford it: schools are so dear.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just\nnow\u2014is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-curtain. You pay\nher, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,\u2014more so; for you have\nthem both to keep in addition.\u201d\n \nI feared\u2014or should I say, hoped?\u2014the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester\nglance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never\nturned his eyes.\n \n\u201cI have not considered the subject,\u201d said he indifferently, looking straight\nbefore him.\n \n\u201cNo, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama\non the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at\nleast in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all\nincubi\u2014were they not, mama?\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you speak, my own?\u201d\n \nThe young lady thus claimed as the dowager\u2019s special property, reiterated her\nquestion with an explanation.\n \n\u201cMy dearest, don\u2019t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I have\nsuffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have\nnow done with them!\u201d\n \nMrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her ear;\nI suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the\nanathematised race was present.\n \n\u201cTant pis!\u201d said her Ladyship, \u201cI hope it may do her good!\u201d Then, in a lower\ntone, but still loud enough for me to hear, \u201cI noticed her; I am a judge of\nphysiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat are they, madam?\u201d inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\n \n\u201cI will tell you in your private ear,\u201d replied she, wagging her turban three\ntimes with portentous significancy.\n \n\u201cBut my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.\u201d\n \n\u201cAsk Blanche; she is nearer you than I.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, don\u2019t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the whole\ntribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took\ncare to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss\nWilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to\njoin in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson\nwas a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of\nvanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took\neffect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions,\nwhen we had driven her to extremities\u2014spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and\nbutter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the\nruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember those\nmerry days?\u201d\n \n\u201cYaas, to be sure I do,\u201d drawled Lord Ingram; \u201cand the poor old stick used to\ncry out, \u2018Oh you villains childs!\u2019\u2014and then we sermonised her on the\npresumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was\nherself so ignorant.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or persecuting) your\ntutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining\u2014the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. He\nand Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other\u2014at least\nTedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we\ninterpreted as tokens of \u2018la belle passion,\u2019 and I promise you the public soon\nhad the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist\nour dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an\ninkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did you\nnot, my lady-mother?\u201d\n \n\u201cCertainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be\ntolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste, we all know\nthem: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and\nconsequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached\u2014mutual alliance and\nreliance; confidence thence resulting\u2014insolence accompanying\u2014mutiny and general\nblow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?\u201d\n \n\u201cMy lily-flower, you are right now, as always.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen no more need be said: change the subject.\u201d\n \nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft,\ninfantine tone: \u201cLouisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such\na good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out. She was never\ncross with us; was she, Louisa?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and\nturn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, she would give us\nanything we asked for.\u201d\n \n\u201cI suppose, now,\u201d said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, \u201cwe shall\nhave an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to\navert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr.\nRochester, do you second my motion?\u201d\n \n\u201cMadam, I support you on this point, as on every other.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are you in\nvoice to-night?\u201d\n \n\u201cDonna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and\nother vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?\u201d\n \n\u201cA fig for Rizzio!\u201d cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as she\nmoved to the piano. \u201cIt is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an\ninsipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is\nnothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say what it will\nof James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort of wild, fierce,\nbandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand.\u201d\n \n\u201cGentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?\u201d cried Mr.\nRochester.\n \n\u201cI should say the preference lies with you,\u201d responded Colonel Dent.\n \n\u201cOn my honour, I am much obliged to you,\u201d was the reply.\n \nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant\nprelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high horse to-night; both\nher words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but\nthe amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as\nsomething very dashing and daring indeed.\n \n\u201cOh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!\u201d exclaimed she, rattling\naway at the instrument. \u201cPoor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond\npapa\u2019s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama\u2019s permission and\nguardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their\nwhite hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty!\nAs if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman\u2014her legitimate\nappanage and heritage! I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face\nof creation; but as to the gentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess\nonly strength and valour: let their motto be:\u2014Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest\nis not worth a fillip. Such should be my device, were I a man.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhenever I marry,\u201d she continued after a pause which none interrupted, \u201cI am\nresolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I will suffer no\ncompetitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions\nshall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr.\nRochester, now sing, and I will play for you.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am all obedience,\u201d was the response.\n \n\u201cHere then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that\nreason, sing it con spirito.\u201d\n \n\u201cCommands from Miss Ingram\u2019s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and\nwater.\u201d\n \n\u201cTake care, then: if you don\u2019t please me, I will shame you by showing how such\nthings should be done.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail.\u201d\n \n\u201cGardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate\npunishment.\u201d\n \n\u201cMiss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a\nchastisement beyond mortal endurance.\u201d\n \n\u201cHa! explain!\u201d commanded the lady.\n \n\u201cPardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you\nthat one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital\npunishment.\u201d\n \n\u201cSing!\u201d said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an accompaniment\nin spirited style.\n \n\u201cNow is my time to slip away,\u201d thought I: but the tones that then severed the\nair arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he\ndid\u2014a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own\nforce; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation\nstrangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired\u2014till the\ntide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my\nsheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.\nThence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my\nsandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the\nmat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a\ngentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr.\nRochester.\n \n\u201cHow do you do?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cI am very well, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy did you not come and speak to me in the room?\u201d\n \nI thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I would not\ntake that freedom. I answered\u2014\n \n\u201cI did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat have you been doing during my absence?\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing particular; teaching Ad\u00e8le as usual.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd getting a good deal paler than you were\u2014as I saw at first sight. What is\nthe matter?\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing at all, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you take any cold that night you half drowned me?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot the least.\u201d\n \n\u201cReturn to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am tired, sir.\u201d\n \nHe looked at me for a minute.\n \n\u201cAnd a little depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about? Tell me.\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing\u2014nothing, sir. I am not depressed.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring\ntears to your eyes\u2014indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead\nhas slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag. If I had time, and was not\nin mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what\nall this means. Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my\nvisitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is\nmy wish; don\u2019t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Ad\u00e8le. Good-night, my\u2014\u201d\nHe stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\n",
        "\nMerry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from\nthe first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed\nbeneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy\nassociations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long. You\ncould not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front\nchambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady\u2019s-maid or a\ndandy valet.\n \nThe kitchen, the butler\u2019s pantry, the servants\u2019 hall, the entrance hall, were\nequally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky\nand halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out\ninto the grounds. Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in\nfor some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only\nbecame more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor\ngaiety.\n \nI wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\nentertainment was proposed: they spoke of \u201cplaying charades,\u201d but in my\nignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, the\ndining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs\nplaced in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other\ngentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down\nstairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information\nrespecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any\nkind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their\ncontents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black\nmodes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails;\nthen a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\nboudoir within the drawing-room.\n \nMeantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was\nselecting certain of their number to be of his party. \u201cMiss Ingram is mine, of\ncourse,\u201d said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He\nlooked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of\nMrs. Dent\u2019s bracelet, which had got loose.\n \n\u201cWill you play?\u201d he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I rather\nfeared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.\n \nHe and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was\nheaded by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of the\ngentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked\nto join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d I heard her say: \u201cshe looks too stupid for any game of the sort.\u201d\n \nEre long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the bulky\nfigure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen\nenveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a large book; and\nat his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester\u2019s cloak, and holding a\nbook in her hand. Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Ad\u00e8le (who had\ninsisted on being one of her guardian\u2019s party), bounded forward, scattering\nround her the contents of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then\nappeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on\nher head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\nRochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent\nand Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them. A\nceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the\npantomime of a marriage. At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party\nconsulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out\u2014\n \n\u201cBride!\u201d Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n \nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The drawing-room, as\nI have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the\ntop of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a\nlarge marble basin, which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory\u2014where\nit usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish\u2014and whence\nit must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and\nweight.\n \nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,\ncostumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes and swarthy skin\nand Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very model of an\nEastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring. Presently advanced into\nview Miss Ingram. She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf\ntied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her\ntemples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of form and\nfeature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of some\nIsraelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the\ncharacter she intended to represent.\n \nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she again\nlifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost\nher; to make some request:\u2014\u201cShe hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and\ngave him to drink.\u201d From the bosom of his robe he then produced a casket,\nopened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment\nand admiration; kneeling, he laid the treasure at her feet; incredulity and\ndelight were expressed by her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the\nbracelets on her arms and the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca:\nthe camels only were wanting.\n \nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not\nagree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated. Colonel Dent, their\nspokesman, demanded \u201cthe tableau of the whole;\u201d whereupon the curtain again\ndescended.\n \nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest\nbeing concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery.\nThe marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table and a kitchen\nchair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn\nlantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.\n \nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his\nknees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester; though the\nbegrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as if\nit had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling\ncountenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him. As he\nmoved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were attached fetters.\n \n\u201cBridewell!\u201d exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\n \nA sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\nordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss\nIngram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\n \n\u201cDo you know,\u201d said she, \u201cthat, of the three characters, I liked you in the\nlast best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant\ngentleman-highwayman you would have made!\u201d\n \n\u201cIs all the soot washed from my face?\u201d he asked, turning it towards her.\n \n\u201cAlas! yes: the more\u2019s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your\ncomplexion than that ruffian\u2019s rouge.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou would like a hero of the road then?\u201d\n \n\u201cAn English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit;\nand that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since,\nin the presence of all these witnesses.\u201d She giggled, and her colour rose.\n \n\u201cNow, Dent,\u201d continued Mr. Rochester, \u201cit is your turn.\u201d And as the other party\nwithdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss Ingram placed herself at\nher leader\u2019s right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of\nhim and her. I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest\nfor the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes,\nerewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle\nof chairs. What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they\nchose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the\nconsultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss\nIngram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him, till\nthe jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his cheek; I hear\ntheir mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something\neven of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.\n \nI have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not\nunlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\u2014because\nI might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my\ndirection\u2014because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who\nscorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her\ndark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as\nfrom an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I\nfelt sure he would soon marry this very lady\u2014because I read daily in her a\nproud security in his intentions respecting her\u2014because I witnessed hourly in\nhim a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought\nthan to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very\npride, irresistible.\n \nThere was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to\ncreate despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a\nwoman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram\u2019s.\nBut I was not jealous: or very rarely;\u2014the nature of the pain I suffered could\nnot be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was\ntoo inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I\nsay. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many\nbrilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature:\nnothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\nby its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat\nsounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own.\nShe advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of\nsympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her. Too often she betrayed\nthis, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived\nagainst little Ad\u00e8le: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she\nhappened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always\ntreating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these\nmanifestations of character\u2014watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the\nfuture bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a\nceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity\u2014this guardedness of\nhis\u2014this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one\u2019s defects\u2014this obvious\nabsence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-torturing pain\narose.\n \nI saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons, because\nher rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her his love, and\nthat her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure. This\nwas the point\u2014this was where the nerve was touched and teased\u2014this was where\nthe fever was sustained and fed: she could not charm him.\n \nIf she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid\nhis heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and\n(figuratively) have died to them. If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble\nwoman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one\nvital struggle with two tigers\u2014jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out\nand devoured, I should have admired her\u2014acknowledged her excellence, and been\nquiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the\ndeeper would have been my admiration\u2014the more truly tranquil my quiescence. But\nas matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram\u2019s efforts at fascinating Mr.\nRochester, to witness their repeated failure\u2014herself unconscious that they did\nfail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly\npluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled\nfurther and further what she wished to allure\u2014to witness this, was to be\nat once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\n \nBecause, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows that\ncontinually glanced off from Mr. Rochester\u2019s breast and fell harmless at his\nfeet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his proud\nheart\u2014have called love into his stern eye, and softness into his sardonic face;\nor, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.\n \n\u201cWhy can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to\nhim?\u201d I asked myself. \u201cSurely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with\ntrue affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her\nglances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so\nmultitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his\nside, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart. I have seen in his\nface a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so\nvivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by\nmeretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it\u2014to\nanswer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without\ngrimace\u2014and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a\nfostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when they are married? I\ndo not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife\nmight, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.\u201d\n \nI have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester\u2019s project of\nmarrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first discovered\nthat such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely to be influenced\nby motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered\nthe position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in\njudging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas\nand principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their\nclass held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding\nthem such as I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like\nhim, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\nobviousness of the advantages to the husband\u2019s own happiness offered by this\nplan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of\nwhich I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I\nwished to act.\n \nBut in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master:\nI was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out. It\nhad formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his character: to take the\nbad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable\njudgment. Now I saw no bad. The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that\nhad startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their\npresence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.\nAnd as for the vague something\u2014was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or\na desponding expression?\u2014that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in\nhis eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially\ndisclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had\nbeen wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground\nquiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and\nwith throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to shun,\nI longed only to dare\u2014to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because\none day she might look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and\nanalyse their nature.\n \nMeantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride\u2014saw only them,\nheard only their discourse, and considered only their movements of\nimportance\u2014the rest of the party were occupied with their own separate\ninterests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in\nsolemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held\nup their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror,\naccording to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified\npuppets. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two\nsometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel\nDent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\nbusiness. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and\nwith one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant\nspeeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their\nby-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr.\nRochester and\u2014because closely connected with him\u2014Miss Ingram were the life and\nsoul of the party. If he was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible\ndulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was\nsure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.\n \nThe want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that\nhe had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till\nlate. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a\ngipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred.\nSome of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with\nthe younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers\nIngram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after\nhaving repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and\nMrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some\nsentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from\nthe library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared\nto beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence. The room and\nthe house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players\nwas heard from above.\n \nIt was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to\ndress for dinner, when little Ad\u00e8le, who knelt by me in the drawing-room\nwindow-seat, suddenly exclaimed\u2014\n \n\u201cVoil\u00e0 Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!\u201d\n \nI turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,\nlooked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of\nwheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A\npost-chaise was approaching.\n \n\u201cWhat can possess him to come home in that style?\u201d said Miss Ingram. \u201cHe rode\nMesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with\nhim:\u2014what has he done with the animals?\u201d\n \nAs she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the\nwindow, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in\nher eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled her\nlip and moved to another casement. The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the\ndoor-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not\nMr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\n \n\u201cHow provoking!\u201d exclaimed Miss Ingram: \u201cyou tiresome monkey!\u201d (apostrophising\nAd\u00e8le), \u201cwho perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?\u201d and she\ncast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.\n \nSome parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered. He\nbowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\n \n\u201cIt appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen my friend,\nMr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think\nI may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here\ntill he returns.\u201d\n \nHis manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat\nunusual,\u2014not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: his age might\nbe about Mr. Rochester\u2019s,\u2014between thirty and forty; his complexion was\nsingularly sallow: otherwise he was a fine-looking man, at first sight\nespecially. On closer examination, you detected something in his face that\ndispleased, or rather that failed to please. His features were regular, but too\nrelaxed: his eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a\ntame, vacant life\u2014at least so I thought.\n \nThe sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after\ndinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease. But I liked his\nphysiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time\nunsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and had no meaning in its wandering:\nthis gave him an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen. For a\nhandsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there\nwas no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in\nthat aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,\neven forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\n \nAs I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the girandoles\non the mantelpiece beaming full over him\u2014for he occupied an arm-chair drawn\nclose to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold, I\ncompared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the\ncontrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon:\nbetween a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\n \nHe had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs\nmust have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that \u201cextremes\nmeet.\u201d\n \nTwo or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps of\ntheir conversation across the room. At first I could not make much sense of\nwhat I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat\nnearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals.\nThese last were discussing the stranger; they both called him \u201ca beautiful\nman.\u201d Louisa said he was \u201ca love of a creature,\u201d and she \u201cadored him;\u201d and Mary\ninstanced his \u201cpretty little mouth, and nice nose,\u201d as her ideal of the\ncharming.\n \n\u201cAnd what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!\u201d cried Louisa,\u2014\u201cso smooth\u2014none of\nthose frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and\nsmile!\u201d\n \nAnd then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of\nthe room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.\n \nI was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I\npresently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that\nhe was but just arrived in England, and that he came from some hot country:\nwhich was the reason, doubtless, his face was so sallow, and that he sat so\nnear the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house. Presently the words Jamaica,\nKingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was\nwith no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and\nbecome acquainted with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend\u2019s dislike of the\nburning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.\nRochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the\ncontinent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a\nhint given of visits to more distant shores.\n \nI was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one,\nbroke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to\nopen the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out\nits flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red. The footman who\nbrought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton\u2019s chair, and said\nsomething to him in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, \u201cold\nwoman,\u201d\u2014\u201cquite troublesome.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off,\u201d\nreplied the magistrate.\n \n\u201cNo\u2014stop!\u201d interrupted Colonel Dent. \u201cDon\u2019t send her away, Eshton; we might\nturn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.\u201d And speaking aloud, he\ncontinued\u2014\u201cLadies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp;\nSam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants\u2019 hall at\nthis moment, and insists upon being brought in before \u2018the quality,\u2019 to tell\nthem their fortunes. Would you like to see her?\u201d\n \n\u201cSurely, colonel,\u201d cried Lady Ingram, \u201cyou would not encourage such a low\nimpostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,\u201d said the footman; \u201cnor can any\nof the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating her to be gone;\nbut she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir\nher from it till she gets leave to come in here.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d asked Mrs. Eshton.\n \n\u201c\u2018To tell the gentry their fortunes,\u2019 she says, ma\u2019am; and she swears she must\nand will do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is she like?\u201d inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\n \n\u201cA shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, she\u2019s a real sorceress!\u201d cried Frederick Lynn. \u201cLet us have her in, of\ncourse.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d rejoined his brother; \u201cit would be a thousand pities to throw\naway such a chance of fun.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy dear boys, what are you thinking about?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\n \n\u201cI cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,\u201d chimed in the\nDowager Ingram.\n \n\u201cIndeed, mama, but you can\u2014and will,\u201d pronounced the haughty voice of Blanche,\nas she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had sat silent,\napparently examining sundry sheets of music. \u201cI have a curiosity to hear my\nfortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy darling Blanche! recollect\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cI do\u2014I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will\u2014quick, Sam!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014yes!\u201d cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. \u201cLet her\ncome\u2014it will be excellent sport!\u201d\n \nThe footman still lingered. \u201cShe looks such a rough one,\u201d said he.\n \n\u201cGo!\u201d ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\n \nExcitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and\njests was proceeding when Sam returned.\n \n\u201cShe won\u2019t come now,\u201d said he. \u201cShe says it\u2019s not her mission to appear before\nthe \u2018vulgar herd\u2019 (them\u2019s her words). I must show her into a room by herself,\nand then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou see now, my queenly Blanche,\u201d began Lady Ingram, \u201cshe encroaches. Be\nadvised, my angel girl\u2014and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cShow her into the library, of course,\u201d cut in the \u201cangel girl.\u201d \u201cIt is not my\nmission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have her all\nto myself. Is there a fire in the library?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2014but she looks such a tinkler.\u201d\n \n\u201cCease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.\u201d\n \nAgain Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once\nmore.\n \n\u201cShe\u2019s ready now,\u201d said the footman, as he reappeared. \u201cShe wishes to know who\nwill be her first visitor.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,\u201d said\nColonel Dent.\n \n\u201cTell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.\u201d\n \nSam went and returned.\n \n\u201cShe says, sir, that she\u2019ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves\nto come near her; nor,\u201d he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, \u201cany\nladies either, except the young, and single.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy Jove, she has taste!\u201d exclaimed Henry Lynn.\n \nMiss Ingram rose solemnly: \u201cI go first,\u201d she said, in a tone which might have\nbefitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his men.\n \n\u201cOh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause\u2014reflect!\u201d was her mama\u2019s cry; but she swept\npast her in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held\nopen, and we heard her enter the library.\n \nA comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it \u201cle cas\u201d to wring her\nhands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for her part,\nshe never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath, and\nlooked a little frightened.\n \nThe minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-door\nagain opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.\n \nWould she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a glance of\neager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she\nlooked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it\nin silence.\n \n\u201cWell, Blanche?\u201d said Lord Ingram.\n \n\u201cWhat did she say, sister?\u201d asked Mary.\n \n\u201cWhat did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?\u201d demanded\nthe Misses Eshton.\n \n\u201cNow, now, good people,\u201d returned Miss Ingram, \u201cdon\u2019t press upon me. Really\nyour organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the\nimportance of you all\u2014my good mama included\u2014ascribe to this matter, absolutely\nto believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with\nthe old gentleman. I have seen a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed\nfashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My\nwhim is gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in\nthe stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.\u201d\n \nMiss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further\nconversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she\nnever turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and\nmore sourly expressive of disappointment. She had obviously not heard anything\nto her advantage: and it seemed to me, from her prolonged fit of gloom and\ntaciturnity, that she herself, notwithstanding her professed indifference,\nattached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her.\n \nMeantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go alone;\nand yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened through the medium of\nthe ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said\nSam\u2019s calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with\ngreat difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon\nher in a body.\n \nTheir visit was not so still as Miss Ingram\u2019s had been: we heard hysterical\ngiggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of\nabout twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the\nhall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\n \n\u201cI am sure she is something not right!\u201d they cried, one and all. \u201cShe told us\nsuch things! She knows all about us!\u201d and they sank breathless into the various\nseats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\n \nPressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of things they\nhad said and done when they were mere children; described books and ornaments\nthey had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had\npresented to them. They affirmed that she had even divined their thoughts, and\nhad whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she liked best in the\nworld, and informed them of what they most wished for.\n \nHere the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened\non these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations,\ntremors, and titters, in return for their importunity. The matrons, meantime,\noffered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the\nexpression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and\nthe elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the\nagitated fair ones.\n \nIn the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in\nthe scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and saw Sam.\n \n\u201cIf you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single\nlady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go\ntill she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it.\nWhat shall I tell her?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I will go by all means,\u201d I answered: and I was glad of the unexpected\nopportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped out of the room,\nunobserved by any eye\u2014for the company were gathered in one mass about the\ntrembling trio just returned\u2014and I closed the door quietly behind me.\n \n\u201cIf you like, miss,\u201d said Sam, \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the hall for you; and if she\nfrightens you, just call and I\u2019ll come in.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.\u201d Nor was I; but\nI was a good deal interested and excited.\n",
        "\nThe library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl\u2014if Sibyl she\nwere\u2014was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-corner. She had\non a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied\ndown with a striped handkerchief under her chin. An extinguished candle stood\non the table; she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little\nblack book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the\nwords to herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist\nimmediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.\n \nI stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at\na distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in\nmy life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy\u2019s appearance to trouble one\u2019s\ncalm. She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her\nface, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked\nall brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which\npassed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye\nconfronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.\n \n\u201cWell, and you want your fortune told?\u201d she said, in a voice as decided as her\nglance, as harsh as her features.\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn\nyou, I have no faith.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your\nstep as you crossed the threshold.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you? You\u2019ve a quick ear.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou need them all in your trade.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do; especially when I\u2019ve customers like you to deal with. Why don\u2019t you\ntremble?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn pale?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am not sick.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you consult my art?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m not silly.\u201d\n \nThe old crone \u201cnichered\u201d a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then drew\nout a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having indulged a while\nin this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the pipe from her lips, and\nwhile gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately\u2014\n \n\u201cYou are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.\u201d\n \n\u201cProve it,\u201d I rejoined.\n \n\u201cI will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes\nthe fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings,\nthe highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you. You are\nsilly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will\nyou stir one step to meet it where it waits you.\u201d\n \nShe again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking with\nvigour.\n \n\u201cYou might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary\ndependent in a great house.\u201d\n \n\u201cI might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any one?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn my circumstances.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another precisely\nplaced as you are.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would be easy to find you thousands.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated:\nvery near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are all prepared;\nthere only wants a movement to combine them. Chance laid them somewhat apart;\nlet them be once approached and bliss results.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I must cross it with silver, I suppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo be sure.\u201d\n \nI gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she took out\nof her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she told me to hold\nout my hand. I did. She approached her face to the palm, and pored over it\nwithout touching it.\n \n\u201cIt is too fine,\u201d said she. \u201cI can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost\nwithout lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there.\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe you,\u201d said I.\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d she continued, \u201cit is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in\nthe lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! now you are coming to reality,\u201d I said, as I obeyed her. \u201cI shall begin to\nput some faith in you presently.\u201d\n \nI knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a ripple of\nlight broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she sat, only threw\nher face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.\n \n\u201cI wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,\u201d she said, when she had\nexamined me a while. \u201cI wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all\nthe hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like\nshapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between\nyou and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the\nactual substance.\u201d\n \n\u201cI feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of\nthe future?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up\na school some day in a little house rented by myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cA mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat\n(you see I know your habits)\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have learned them from the servants.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an\nacquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole\u2014\u201d\n \nI started to my feet when I heard the name.\n \n\u201cYou have\u2014have you?\u201d thought I; \u201cthere is diablerie in the business after all,\nthen!\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d continued the strange being; \u201cshe\u2019s a safe hand is Mrs.\nPoole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But, as I was\nsaying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future\nschool? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas\nand chairs before you? Is there not one face you study? one figure whose\nmovements you follow with at least curiosity?\u201d\n \n\u201cI like to observe all the faces and all the figures.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut do you never single one from the rest\u2014or it may be, two?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it\namuses me to watch them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat tale do you like best to hear?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same theme\u2014courtship;\nand promise to end in the same catastrophe\u2014marriage.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd do you like that monotonous theme?\u201d\n \n\u201cPositively, I don\u2019t care about it: it is nothing to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with\nbeauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the\neyes of a gentleman you\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cI what?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou know\u2014and perhaps think well of.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with\none of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and\nstately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but\ncertainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they\nplease, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment\nto me.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable with one\nof them? Will you say that of the master of the house!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is not at home.\u201d\n \n\u201cA profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning,\nand will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him\nfrom the list of your acquaintance\u2014blot him, as it were, out of existence?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had\nintroduced.\u201d\n \n\u201cI was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many\nsmiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester\u2019s eyes that they overflow like two\ncups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all the\ntales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most\nlively and the most continuous?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.\u201d I said this\nrather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by\nthis time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected sentence came from her\nlips after another, till I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered\nwhat unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings\nand taking record of every pulse.\n \n\u201cEagerness of a listener!\u201d repeated she: \u201cyes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the\nhour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their\ntask of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked\nso grateful for the pastime given him; you have noticed this?\u201d\n \n\u201cGrateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.\u201d\n \n\u201cDetecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not\ngratitude?\u201d\n \nI said nothing.\n \n\u201cYou have seen love: have you not?\u2014and, looking forward, you have seen him\nmarried, and beheld his bride happy?\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! Not exactly. Your witch\u2019s skill is rather at fault sometimes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat the devil have you seen, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr.\nRochester is to be married?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.\u201d\n \n\u201cShortly?\u201d\n \n\u201cAppearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an\naudacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will\nbe a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome, noble, witty,\naccomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not his person, at least\nhis purse. I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last\ndegree; though (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an\nhour ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half\nan inch. I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes,\nwith a longer or clearer rent-roll,\u2014he\u2019s dished\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester\u2019s fortune: I came to hear my\nown; and you have told me nothing of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYour fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait\ncontradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know.\nI knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it carefully on one\nside for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand,\nand take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again\non the rug.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t keep me long; the fire scorches me.\u201d\n \nI knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her\nchair. She began muttering,\u2014\n \n\u201cThe flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full\nof feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows\nimpression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an\nunconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting\nfrom loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it\nseems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already\nmade,\u2014to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and\nreserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.\n \n\u201cAs to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart\nall that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent on much the\nheart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed\nin the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and\nsmile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor. That feature too is\npropitious.\n \n\u201cI see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes\nto say,\u2014\u2018I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to\ndo. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with\nme, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or\noffered only at a price I cannot afford to give.\u2019 The forehead declares,\n\u2018Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst\naway and hurry her to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true\nheathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things:\nbut judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting\nvote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:\nbut I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the\ndictates of conscience.\u2019\n \n\u201cWell said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have formed my\nplans\u2014right plans I deem them\u2014and in them I have attended to the claims of\nconscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom\nperish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour\nof remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution\u2014such\nis not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight\u2014to earn gratitude, not to\nwring tears of blood\u2014no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in\nendearments, in sweet\u2014That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite\ndelirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I\ndare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly\nswore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss\nEyre: leave me; \u2018the play is played out.\u2019\u201d\n \nWhere was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream still? The\nold woman\u2019s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and all were familiar\nto me as my own face in a glass\u2014as the speech of my own tongue. I got up, but\ndid not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her\nbonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.\nThe flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for\ndiscoveries, I at once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of\neld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers,\nsymmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping\nforward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again\nI looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me\u2014on the contrary, the\nbonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.\n \n\u201cWell, Jane, do you know me?\u201d asked the familiar voice.\n \n\u201cOnly take off the red cloak, sir, and then\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut the string is in a knot\u2014help me.\u201d\n \n\u201cBreak it, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere, then\u2014\u2018Off, ye lendings!\u2019\u201d And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his\ndisguise.\n \n\u201cNow, sir, what a strange idea!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut well carried out, eh? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith the ladies you must have managed well.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut not with you?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou did not act the character of a gipsy with me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat character did I act? My own?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying to draw\nme out\u2014or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is\nscarcely fair, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you forgive me, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cI cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I\nhave fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not\nright.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, you have been very correct\u2014very careful, very sensible.\u201d\n \nI reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, I\nhad been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview. Something of\nmasquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express\nthemselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself; besides I had noted\nher feigned voice, her anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been\nrunning on Grace Poole\u2014that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I\nconsidered her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat are you musing about? What does that grave smile\nsignify?\u201d\n \n\u201cWonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I\nsuppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are\ndoing.\u201d\n \n\u201cDiscussing the gipsy, I daresay.\u201d\n \n\u201cSit down!\u2014Let me hear what they said about me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o\u2019clock. Oh, are you\naware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this\nmorning?\u201d\n \n\u201cA stranger!\u2014no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of\ninstalling himself here till you returned.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe devil he did! Did he give his name?\u201d\n \n\u201cHis name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town,\nin Jamaica, I think.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead me to a\nchair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his lips\nfroze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.\n \n\u201cMason!\u2014the West Indies!\u201d he said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking\nautomaton to enounce its single words; \u201cMason!\u2014the West Indies!\u201d he reiterated;\nand he went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of\nspeaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly seemed to know what he was doing.\n \n\u201cDo you feel ill, sir?\u201d I inquired.\n \n\u201cJane, I\u2019ve got a blow; I\u2019ve got a blow, Jane!\u201d He staggered.\n \n\u201cOh, lean on me, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, yes; and my arm.\u201d\n \nHe sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his own, he\nchafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary\nlook.\n \n\u201cMy little friend!\u201d said he, \u201cI wish I were in a quiet island with only you;\nand trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan I help you, sir?\u2014I\u2019d give my life to serve you.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, if aid is wanted, I\u2019ll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.\u201d\n \n\u201cThank you, sir. Tell me what to do,\u2014I\u2019ll try, at least, to do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cFetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at\nsupper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is doing.\u201d\n \nI went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester\nhad said; they were not seated at table,\u2014the supper was arranged on the\nsideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood about here and there in\ngroups, their plates and glasses in their hands. Every one seemed in high glee;\nlaughter and conversation were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the\nfire, talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I\nfilled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she\nthought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.\n \nMr. Rochester\u2019s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more firm\nand stern. He took the glass from my hand.\n \n\u201cHere is to your health, ministrant spirit!\u201d he said. He swallowed the contents\nand returned it to me. \u201cWhat are they doing, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cLaughing and talking, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd Mason?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe was laughing too.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cTurn them out of the room, sir, if I could.\u201d\n \nHe half smiled. \u201cBut if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me\ncoldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and\nleft me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?\u201d\n \n\u201cI rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo comfort me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?\u201d\n \n\u201cI, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should care\nnothing about it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, you could dare censure for my sake?\u201d\n \n\u201cI could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you,\nI am sure, do.\u201d\n \n\u201cGo back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear\nthat Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then\nleave me.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \nI did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight among them.\nI sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him from the room: I\nushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.\n \nAt a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair\nto their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester\u2019s voice, and heard him say,\n\u201cThis way, Mason; this is your room.\u201d\n \nHe spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon asleep.\n",
        "\nI had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let down\nmy window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and\nbright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky\nopposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her\nglorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her\ndisk\u2014silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half\nrose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.\n \nGood God! What a cry!\n \nThe night\u2014its silence\u2014its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a\nshrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\n \nMy pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed. The cry\ndied, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek\ncould not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could,\ntwice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his eyrie.\nThe thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort.\n \nIt came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And overhead\u2014yes, in\nthe room just above my chamber-ceiling\u2014I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it\nseemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted\u2014\n \n\u201cHelp! help! help!\u201d three times rapidly.\n \n\u201cWill no one come?\u201d it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went\non wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:\u2014\n \n\u201cRochester! Rochester! for God\u2019s sake, come!\u201d\n \nA chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. Another step\nstamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.\n \nI had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my\napartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs\nsounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another\nlooked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their\nbeds; and \u201cOh! what is it?\u201d\u2014\u201cWho is hurt?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d\u2014\u201cFetch a\nlight!\u201d\u2014\u201cIs it fire?\u201d\u2014\u201cAre there robbers?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhere shall we run?\u201d was demanded\nconfusedly on all hands. But for the moonlight they would have been in complete\ndarkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some\nstumbled: the confusion was inextricable.\n \n\u201cWhere the devil is Rochester?\u201d cried Colonel Dent. \u201cI cannot find him in his\nbed.\u201d\n \n\u201cHere! here!\u201d was shouted in return. \u201cBe composed, all of you: I\u2019m coming.\u201d\n \nAnd the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with\na candle: he had just descended from the upper storey. One of the ladies ran to\nhim directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.\n \n\u201cWhat awful event has taken place?\u201d said she. \u201cSpeak! let us know the worst at\nonce!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut don\u2019t pull me down or strangle me,\u201d he replied: for the Misses Eshton were\nclinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were\nbearing down on him like ships in full sail.\n \n\u201cAll\u2019s right!\u2014all\u2019s right!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about\nNothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.\u201d\n \nAnd dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself by an\neffort, he added\u2014\n \n\u201cA servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She\u2019s an excitable, nervous\nperson: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something of that sort,\nno doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now, then, I must see you all back\ninto your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after.\nGentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am\nsure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa,\nreturn to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames\u201d (to the\ndowagers), \u201cyou will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill\ngallery any longer.\u201d\n \nAnd so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get them\nall once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did not wait to be\nordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.\n \nNot, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\ncarefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been\nuttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had proceeded from the\nroom above mine: but they assured me that it was not a servant\u2019s dream which\nhad thus struck horror through the house; and that the explanation Mr.\nRochester had given was merely an invention framed to pacify his guests. I\ndressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by\nthe window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting\nfor I knew not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange\ncry, struggle, and call.\n \nNo: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in about\nan hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It seemed that sleep\nand night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon declined: she was about\nto set. Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down\non my bed, dressed as I was. I left the window, and moved with little noise\nacross the carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped\nlow at the door.\n \n\u201cAm I wanted?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cAre you up?\u201d asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master\u2019s.\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd dressed?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cCome out, then, quietly.\u201d\n \nI obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\n \n\u201cI want you,\u201d he said: \u201ccome this way: take your time, and make no noise.\u201d\n \nMy slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat. He\nglided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor\nof the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his side.\n \n\u201cHave you a sponge in your room?\u201d he asked in a whisper.\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you any salts\u2014volatile salts?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cGo back and fetch both.\u201d\n \nI returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer, and\nonce more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his hand:\napproaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock; he paused,\nand addressed me again.\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t turn sick at the sight of blood?\u201d\n \n\u201cI think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.\u201d\n \nI felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.\n \n\u201cJust give me your hand,\u201d he said: \u201cit will not do to risk a fainting fit.\u201d\n \nI put my fingers into his. \u201cWarm and steady,\u201d was his remark: he turned the key\nand opened the door.\n \nI saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax showed me\nover the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was now looped up\nin one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then been concealed. This\ndoor was open; a light shone out of the room within: I heard thence a snarling,\nsnatching sound, almost like a dog quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his\ncandle, said to me, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d and he went forward to the inner\napartment. A shout of laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and\nterminating in Grace Poole\u2019s own goblin ha! ha! She then was there. He\nmade some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice\naddress him: he came out and closed the door behind him.\n \n\u201cHere, Jane!\u201d he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed,\nwhich with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber.\nAn easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it, dressed with the\nexception of his coat; he was still; his head leant back; his eyes were closed.\nMr. Rochester held the candle over him; I recognised in his pale and seemingly\nlifeless face\u2014the stranger, Mason: I saw too that his linen on one side, and\none arm, was almost soaked in blood.\n \n\u201cHold the candle,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin of\nwater from the washstand: \u201cHold that,\u201d said he. I obeyed. He took the sponge,\ndipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked for my\nsmelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his\neyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm\nand shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.\n \n\u201cIs there immediate danger?\u201d murmured Mr. Mason.\n \n\u201cPooh! No\u2014a mere scratch. Don\u2019t be so overcome, man: bear up! I\u2019ll fetch a\nsurgeon for you now, myself: you\u2019ll be able to be removed by morning, I hope.\nJane,\u201d he continued.\n \n\u201cSir?\u201d\n \n\u201cI shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or\nperhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns: if he\nfeels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his lips, and\nyour salts to his nose. You will not speak to him on any pretext\u2014and\u2014Richard,\nit will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her: open your\nlips\u2014agitate yourself\u2014and I\u2019ll not answer for the consequences.\u201d\n \nAgain the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear, either of\ndeath or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him. Mr. Rochester put\nthe now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to use it as he had done.\nHe watched me a second, then saying, \u201cRemember!\u2014No conversation,\u201d he left the\nroom. I experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the\nsound of his retreating step ceased to be heard.\n \nHere then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic cells;\nnight around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands; a\nmurderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes\u2014that was appalling\u2014the\nrest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out\nupon me.\n \nI must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly countenance\u2014these\nblue, still lips forbidden to unclose\u2014these eyes now shut, now opening, now\nwandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness\nof horror. I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water,\nand wipe away the trickling gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle\nwane on my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry\nround me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver\nstrangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite\u2014whose front, divided into\ntwelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each\nenclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top rose\nan ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\n \nAccording as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or\nglanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his brow; now\nSt. John\u2019s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew\nout of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the\narch-traitor\u2014of Satan himself\u2014in his subordinate\u2019s form.\n \nAmidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the movements\nof the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since Mr. Rochester\u2019s\nvisit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three\nlong intervals,\u2014a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine\nnoise, and a deep human groan.\n \nThen my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived incarnate in\nthis sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the\nowner?\u2014what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the\ndeadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary\nwoman\u2019s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of\na carrion-seeking bird of prey?\n \nAnd this man I bent over\u2014this commonplace, quiet stranger\u2014how had he become\ninvolved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him? What made him\nseek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he should have been\nasleep in bed? I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him an apartment below\u2014what\nbrought him here! And why, now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery\ndone him? Why did he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester\nenforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had\nbeen outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted\nagainst; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!\nLastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous\nwill of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few\nwords which had passed between them assured me of this. It was evident that in\ntheir former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been\nhabitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had arisen\nMr. Rochester\u2019s dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason\u2019s arrival? Why had the mere\nname of this unresisting individual\u2014whom his word now sufficed to control like\na child\u2014fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on an\noak?\n \nOh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered: \u201cJane, I\nhave got a blow\u2014I have got a blow, Jane.\u201d I could not forget how the arm had\ntrembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no light matter which could\nthus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax\nRochester.\n \n\u201cWhen will he come? When will he come?\u201d I cried inwardly, as the night lingered\nand lingered\u2014as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day\nnor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason\u2019s white lips;\nagain and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed\nineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three\ncombined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak,\nwild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.\n \nThe candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of\ngrey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching. Presently I\nheard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the courtyard: hope\nrevived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the\nyielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more\nthan two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.\n \nMr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\n \n\u201cNow, Carter, be on the alert,\u201d he said to this last: \u201cI give you but\nhalf-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the\npatient downstairs and all.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut is he fit to move, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must be kept\nup. Come, set to work.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in\nall the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn\nwas advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east. Then he\napproached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.\n \n\u201cNow, my good fellow, how are you?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cShe\u2019s done for me, I fear,\u201d was the faint reply.\n \n\u201cNot a whit!\u2014courage! This day fortnight you\u2019ll hardly be a pin the worse of\nit: you\u2019ve lost a little blood; that\u2019s all. Carter, assure him there\u2019s no\ndanger.\u201d\n \n\u201cI can do that conscientiously,\u201d said Carter, who had now undone the bandages;\n\u201conly I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have bled so much\u2014but\nhow is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut. This wound was\nnot done with a knife: there have been teeth here!\u201d\n \n\u201cShe bit me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe worried me like a tigress, when Rochester got\nthe knife from her.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,\u201d said\nMr. Rochester.\n \n\u201cBut under such circumstances, what could one do?\u201d returned Mason. \u201cOh, it was\nfrightful!\u201d he added, shuddering. \u201cAnd I did not expect it: she looked so quiet\nat first.\u201d\n \n\u201cI warned you,\u201d was his friend\u2019s answer; \u201cI said\u2014be on your guard when you go\nnear her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had me with you:\nit was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and alone.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought I could have done some good.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\nhowever, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my\nadvice; so I\u2019ll say no more. Carter\u2014hurry!\u2014hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I\nmust have him off.\u201d\n \n\u201cDirectly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this other wound\nin the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe sucked the blood: she said she\u2019d drain my heart,\u201d said Mason.\n \nI saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror,\nhatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only said\u2014\n \n\u201cCome, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don\u2019t repeat it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI wish I could forget it,\u201d was the answer.\n \n\u201cYou will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town,\nyou may think of her as dead and buried\u2014or rather, you need not think of her at\nall.\u201d\n \n\u201cImpossible to forget this night!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as dead as a\nherring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now. There!\u2014Carter\nhas done with you or nearly so; I\u2019ll make you decent in a trice. Jane\u201d (he\nturned to me for the first time since his re-entrance), \u201ctake this key: go down\ninto my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top\ndrawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring\nthem here; and be nimble.\u201d\n \nI went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and\nreturned with them.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cgo to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but\ndon\u2019t leave the room: you may be wanted again.\u201d\n \nI retired as directed.\n \n\u201cWas anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?\u201d inquired Mr. Rochester\npresently.\n \n\u201cNo, sir; all was very still.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your sake,\nand for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven long to avoid\nexposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here, Carter, help him on\nwith his waist-coat. Where did you leave your furred cloak? You can\u2019t travel a\nmile without that, I know, in this damned cold climate. In your room?\u2014Jane, run\ndown to Mr. Mason\u2019s room,\u2014the one next mine,\u2014and fetch a cloak you will see\nthere.\u201d\n \nAgain I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with\nfur.\n \n\u201cNow, I\u2019ve another errand for you,\u201d said my untiring master; \u201cyou must away to\nmy room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!\u2014a clod-hopping\nmessenger would never do at this juncture. You must open the middle drawer of\nmy toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass you will find\nthere,\u2014quick!\u201d\n \nI flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose\nmyself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian\ncharlatan\u2014a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used\nindiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance. Jane, a\nlittle water.\u201d\n \nHe held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on the\nwashstand.\n \n\u201cThat will do;\u2014now wet the lip of the phial.\u201d\n \nI did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to\nMason.\n \n\u201cDrink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut will it hurt me?\u2014is it inflammatory?\u201d\n \n\u201cDrink! drink! drink!\u201d\n \nMr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was dressed\nnow: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied. Mr. Rochester\nlet him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the liquid; he then took his\narm\u2014\n \n\u201cNow I am sure you can get on your feet,\u201d he said\u2014\u201ctry.\u201d\n \nThe patient rose.\n \n\u201cCarter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard; step\nout\u2014that\u2019s it!\u201d\n \n\u201cI do feel better,\u201d remarked Mr. Mason.\n \n\u201cI am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt\nthe side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in\nthe yard\u2014or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over\nthe pavement\u2014to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come\nto the foot of the stairs and hem.\u201d\n \nIt was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of rising; but\nI found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage door was fastened;\nI opened it with as little noise as possible: all the yard was quiet; but the\ngates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, with horses ready\nharnessed, and driver seated on the box, stationed outside. I approached him,\nand said the gentlemen were coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round\nand listened. The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains\nwere yet drawn over the servants\u2019 chamber windows; little birds were just\ntwittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like\nwhite garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage\nhorses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.\n \nThe gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon,\nseemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the chaise; Carter\nfollowed.\n \n\u201cTake care of him,\u201d said Mr. Rochester to the latter, \u201cand keep him at your\nhouse till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he\ngets on. Richard, how is it with you?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe fresh air revives me, Fairfax.\u201d\n \n\u201cLeave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind\u2014good-bye, Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cFairfax\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell what is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cLet her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her\u2014\u201d\nhe stopped and burst into tears.\n \n\u201cI do my best; and have done it, and will do it,\u201d was the answer: he shut up\nthe chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.\n \n\u201cYet would to God there was an end of all this!\u201d added Mr. Rochester, as he\nclosed and barred the heavy yard-gates.\n \nThis done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the\nwall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to\nreturn to the house; again, however, I heard him call \u201cJane!\u201d He had opened the\nportal and stood at it, waiting for me.\n \n\u201cCome where there is some freshness, for a few moments,\u201d he said; \u201cthat house\nis a mere dungeon: don\u2019t you feel it so?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,\u201d he answered; \u201cand you see it\nthrough a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the\nsilk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods\nmere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now here\u201d (he pointed to the leafy\nenclosure we had entered) \u201call is real, sweet, and pure.\u201d\n \nHe strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry\ntrees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned\nflowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood,\nsweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of\nApril showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them:\nthe sun was just entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the\nwreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\n \n\u201cJane, will you have a flower?\u201d\n \nHe gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.\n \n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light clouds which\nare sure to melt away as the day waxes warm\u2014this placid and balmly atmosphere?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do, very much.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have passed a strange night, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd it has made you look pale\u2014were you afraid when I left you alone with\nMason?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I had fastened the door\u2014I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a\ncareless shepherd if I had left a lamb\u2014my pet lamb\u2014so near a wolf\u2019s den,\nunguarded: you were safe.\u201d\n \n\u201cWill Grace Poole live here still, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh yes! don\u2019t trouble your head about her\u2014put the thing out of your thoughts.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever fear\u2014I will take care of myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cI cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then. To live,\nfor me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any\nday.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is evidently potent\nwith him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me\u2014but,\nunintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not\nof life, yet for ever of happiness.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to\navert the danger.\u201d\n \nHe laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from\nhim.\n \n\u201cIf I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated in a\nmoment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him \u2018Do that,\u2019\nand the thing has been done. But I cannot give him orders in this case: I\ncannot say \u2018Beware of harming me, Richard;\u2019 for it is imperative that I should\nkeep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will\npuzzle you further. You are my little friend, are you not?\u201d\n \n\u201cI like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.\u201d\n \n\u201cPrecisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your\neye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me\u2014working for me, and with\nme, in, as you characteristically say, \u2018all that is right:\u2019 for if I bid\nyou do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no\nneat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would\nthen turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, \u2018No, sir; that is impossible: I\ncannot do it, because it is wrong;\u2019 and would become immutable as a fixed star.\nWell, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you\nwhere I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should\ntransfix me at once.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are\nvery safe.\u201d\n \n\u201cGod grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.\u201d\n \nThe arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic seat.\nMr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him.\n \n\u201cSit,\u201d he said; \u201cthe bench is long enough for two. You don\u2019t hesitate to take a\nplace at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?\u201d\n \nI answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.\n \n\u201cNow, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew\u2014while all the flowers in\nthis old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones\u2019\nbreakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of\nwork\u2014I\u2019ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but\nfirst, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in\ndetaining you, or that you err in staying.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir; I am content.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:\u2014suppose you were no longer a girl\nwell reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards;\nimagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a\ncapital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose\nconsequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence. Mind, I\ndon\u2019t say a crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other\nguilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is\nerror. The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly\ninsupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but\nneither unlawful nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted\nyou on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which\nyou feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base\nassociations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and\nthere, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure\u2014I mean in heartless,\nsensual pleasure\u2014such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and\nsoul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a\nnew acquaintance\u2014how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the\ngood and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never\nbefore encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without\ntaint. Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back\u2014higher\nwishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what\nremains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being. To attain\nthis end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom\u2014a mere\nconventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your\njudgment approves?\u201d\n \nHe paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to\nsuggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain aspiration! The west wind\nwhispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a\nmedium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however\nsweet, was inarticulate.\n \nAgain Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\n \n\u201cIs the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified\nin daring the world\u2019s opinion, in order to attach to him for ever this gentle,\ngracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and\nregeneration of life?\u201d\n \n\u201cSir,\u201d I answered, \u201ca wanderer\u2019s repose or a sinner\u2019s reformation should never\ndepend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die; philosophers falter in wisdom,\nand Christians in goodness: if any one you know has suffered and erred, let him\nlook higher than his equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut the instrument\u2014the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the\ninstrument. I have myself\u2014I tell it you without parable\u2014been a worldly,\ndissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure\nin\u2014\u201d\n \nHe paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I almost\nwondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended\nrevelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes\u2014so long was the\nsilence protracted. At last I looked up at the tardy speaker: he was looking\neagerly at me.\n \n\u201cLittle friend,\u201d said he, in quite a changed tone\u2014while his face changed too,\nlosing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and sarcastic\u2014\u201cyou have\nnoticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don\u2019t you think if I married her\nshe would regenerate me with a vengeance?\u201d\n \nHe got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came\nback he was humming a tune.\n \n\u201cJane, Jane,\u201d said he, stopping before me, \u201cyou are quite pale with your\nvigils: don\u2019t you curse me for disturbing your rest?\u201d\n \n\u201cCurse you? No, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cShake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were warmer\nlast night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber. Jane,\nwhen will you watch with me again?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhenever I can be useful, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be able to\nsleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company? To you I can talk\nof my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe\u2019s a rare one, is she not, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cA strapper\u2014a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such\nas the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there\u2019s Dent and Lynn in the\nstables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.\u201d\n \nAs I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying\ncheerfully\u2014\n \n\u201cMason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise: I\nrose at four to see him off.\u201d\n",
        "\nPresentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and\nthe three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the\nkey. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange\nones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between\nfar-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding\ntheir alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin)\nwhose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may\nbe but the sympathies of Nature with man.\n \nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven\nsay to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that\nto dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one\u2019s self or one\u2019s\nkin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance\nimmediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day\nBessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.\n \nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past\nweek scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a\ndream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on\nmy knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling\nits hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing\none the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever\nmood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven\nsuccessive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\n \nI did not like this iteration of one idea\u2014this strange recurrence of one image,\nand I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near.\nIt was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that\nmoonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day\nfollowing I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in\nMrs. Fairfax\u2019s room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having\nthe appearance of a gentleman\u2019s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and\nthe hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\n \n\u201cI daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,\u201d he said, rising as I entered; \u201cbut my\nname is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead,\neight or nine years since, and I live there still.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give me a\nride sometimes on Miss Georgiana\u2019s bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married\nto Bessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another little\none about two months since\u2014we have three now\u2014and both mother and child are\nthriving.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd are the family well at the house, Robert?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am sorry I can\u2019t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at\npresent\u2014in great trouble.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope no one is dead,\u201d I said, glancing at his black dress. He too looked\ndown at the crape round his hat and replied\u2014\n \n\u201cMr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. John?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd how does his mother bear it?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very\nwild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and his death\nwas shocking.\u201d\n \n\u201cI heard from Bessie he was not doing well.\u201d\n \n\u201cDoing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst\nthe worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into jail: his mother\nhelped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old\ncompanions and habits. His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst\nfooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He came down to Gateshead about three\nweeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him. Missis refused: her means\nhave long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the\nnext news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!\u2014they say he killed\nhimself.\u201d\n \nI was silent: the tidings were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed\u2014\n \n\u201cMissis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout,\nbut was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were\nquite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John\u2019s death and the manner\nof it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without\nspeaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she\nwanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was\nonly yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing\nyour name; and at last she made out the words, \u2018Bring Jane\u2014fetch Jane Eyre: I\nwant to speak to her.\u2019 Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or\nmeans anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and\nadvised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their\nmother grew so restless, and said, \u2018Jane, Jane,\u2019 so many times, that at last\nthey consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I\nshould like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I\nsuppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; and I will do it now;\u201d and having directed him to the servants\u2019 hall, and\nrecommended him to the care of John\u2019s wife, and the attentions of John himself,\nI went in search of Mr. Rochester.\n \nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the stables, or\nthe grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;\u2014yes: she believed he was\nplaying billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click\nof balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram,\nthe two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It\nrequired some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however,\nwas one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss\nIngram\u2019s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes\nseemed to demand, \u201cWhat can the creeping creature want now?\u201d and when I said,\nin a low voice, \u201cMr. Rochester,\u201d she made a movement as if tempted to order me\naway. I remember her appearance at the moment\u2014it was very graceful and very\nstriking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was\ntwisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the game, and irritated\npride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.\n \n\u201cDoes that person want you?\u201d she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester\nturned to see who the \u201cperson\u201d was. He made a curious grimace\u2014one of his\nstrange and equivocal demonstrations\u2014threw down his cue and followed me from\nthe room.\n \n\u201cWell, Jane?\u201d he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which\nhe had shut.\n \n\u201cIf you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat to do?\u2014where to go?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo see a sick lady who has sent for me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat sick lady?\u2014where does she live?\u201d\n \n\u201cAt Gateshead; in \u2014\u2014shire.\u201d\n \n\u201c-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for people to\nsee her that distance?\u201d\n \n\u201cHer name is Reed, sir\u2014Mrs. Reed.\u201d\n \n\u201cReed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is his widow, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what have you to do with her? How do you know her?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Reed was my uncle\u2014my mother\u2019s brother.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no\nrelations.\u201d\n \n\u201cNone that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut Reed left children?\u2014you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of\na Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on\ntown; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was\nmuch admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.\u201d\n \n\u201cJohn Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and\nis supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked his mother that it\nbrought on an apoplectic attack.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a\nhundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach\nher: besides, you say she cast you off.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very\ndifferent: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d\n \n\u201cAs short a time as possible, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cPromise me only to stay a week\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cI had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any\npretext to take up a permanent residence with her?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd who goes with you? You don\u2019t travel a hundred miles alone.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, she has sent her coachman.\u201d\n \n\u201cA person to be trusted?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester meditated. \u201cWhen do you wish to go?\u201d\n \n\u201cEarly to-morrow morning, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you must have some money; you can\u2019t travel without money, and I daresay\nyou have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the\nworld, Jane?\u201d he asked, smiling.\n \nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. \u201cFive shillings, sir.\u201d He took the\npurse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its\nscantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: \u201cHere,\u201d said he,\noffering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him\nI had no change.\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want change; you know that. Take your wages.\u201d\n \nI declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then, as if\nrecollecting something, he said\u2014\n \n\u201cRight, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three\nmonths if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, but now you owe me five.\u201d\n \n\u201cCome back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I\nhave the opportunity.\u201d\n \n\u201cMatter of business? I am curious to hear it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be\nmarried?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; what then?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn that case, sir, Ad\u00e8le ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive\nthe necessity of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo get her out of my bride\u2019s way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too\nemphatically? There\u2019s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it. Ad\u00e8le, as you\nsay, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to\u2014the devil?\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn course!\u201d he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features\nequally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.\n \n\u201cAnd old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to\nseek a place, I suppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in\nasking favours of them\u2014but I shall advertise.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!\u201d he growled. \u201cAt your peril you\nadvertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds.\nGive me back nine pounds, Jane; I\u2019ve a use for it.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd so have I, sir,\u201d I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. \u201cI\ncould not spare the money on any account.\u201d\n \n\u201cLittle niggard!\u201d said he, \u201crefusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five\npounds, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot five shillings, sir; nor five pence.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust let me look at the cash.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir; you are not to be trusted.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane!\u201d\n \n\u201cSir?\u201d\n \n\u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I\u2019ll find you\none in time.\u201d\n \n\u201cI shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and\nAd\u00e8le shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well! very well! I\u2019ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir; early.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, I must prepare for the journey.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?\u201d\n \n\u201cI suppose so, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I\u2019m not\nquite up to it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen say it.\u201d\n \n\u201cFarewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat must I say?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe same, if you like, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cFarewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like\nsomething else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for\ninstance; but no\u2014that would not content me either. So you\u2019ll do no more than\nsay Farewell, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in\nmany.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery likely; but it is blank and cool\u2014\u2018Farewell.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cHow long is he going to stand with his back against that door?\u201d I asked\nmyself; \u201cI want to commence my packing.\u201d The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly\naway he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and\nwas off before he had risen in the morning.\n \nI reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the\nfirst of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very clean\nand neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the\nfloor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the\nfire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert\nand his sister played quietly in a corner.\n \n\u201cBless you!\u2014I knew you would come!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.\n \n\u201cYes, Bessie,\u201d said I, after I had kissed her; \u201cand I trust I am not too late.\nHow is Mrs. Reed?\u2014Alive still, I hope.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor\nsays she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally\nrecover.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas she mentioned me lately?\u201d\n \n\u201cShe was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she\nis sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. She\ngenerally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six\nor seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with\nyou?\u201d\n \nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went\nto welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having\nsome tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept her\nhospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as\npassively as I used to let her undress me when a child.\n \nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about\u2014setting out\nthe tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a\ntea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap\nor push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained her\nquick temper as well as her light foot and good looks.\n \nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still,\nquite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, she said;\nand she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast,\nabsolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty\non a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.\n \nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person\nthe mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master, whether he was a\nnice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was rather an ugly man, but\nquite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I\nwent on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the\nhouse; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely\nof the kind she relished.\n \nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet,\n&c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also\naccompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I\nwas now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a\nhostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart\u2014a sense of outlawry and\nalmost of reprobation\u2014to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so\nfar away and unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my\nprospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a\nwanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and\nmy own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my\nwrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.\n \n\u201cYou shall go into the breakfast-room first,\u201d said Bessie, as she preceded me\nthrough the hall; \u201cthe young ladies will be there.\u201d\n \nIn another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of\nfurniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr.\nBrocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing\nat the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick\u2019s\nBritish Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver\u2019s\nTravels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were\nnot changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.\n \nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss\nIngram\u2014very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something\nascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a\nstraight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away\nfrom the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a\ncrucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance\nto her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.\n \nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered\u2014the\nslim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel,\nfair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and\nringleted yellow hair. The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was\nso different from her sister\u2019s\u2014so much more flowing and becoming\u2014it looked as\nstylish as the other\u2019s looked puritanical.\n \nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother\u2014and only one; the thin\nand pallid elder daughter had her parent\u2019s Cairngorm eye: the blooming and\nluxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin\u2014perhaps a little\nsoftened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance\notherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\n \nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the\nname of \u201cMiss Eyre.\u201d Eliza\u2019s greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice,\nwithout a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and\nseemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d several commonplaces\nabout my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone:\nand accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot\u2014now\ntraversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain\ntrimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting\nyou know that they think you a \u201cquiz\u201d without actually saying the words. A\ncertain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,\nexpress fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any\npositive rudeness in word or deed.\n \nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me\nit once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how\neasy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic\nattentions of the other\u2014Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The\nfact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months\nfeelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could\nraise\u2014pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited\nthan any it was in their power to inflict or bestow\u2014that their airs gave me no\nconcern either for good or bad.\n \n\u201cHow is Mrs. Reed?\u201d I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit\nto bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty.\n \n\u201cMrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see\nher to-night.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf,\u201d said I, \u201cyou would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be\nmuch obliged to you.\u201d\n \nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. \u201cI know\nshe had a particular wish to see me,\u201d I added, \u201cand I would not defer attending\nto her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.\u201d\n \n\u201cMama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,\u201d remarked Eliza. I soon rose,\nquietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step\nout to Bessie\u2014who was, I dared say, in the kitchen\u2014and ask her to ascertain\nwhether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-night. I went, and\nhaving found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take\nfurther measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from\narrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved\nto quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at\nonce that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred\nmiles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better\u2014or dead: as\nto her daughters\u2019 pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself\nindependent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room,\ntold her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk\nconveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the\nlanding.\n \n\u201cMissis is awake,\u201d said she; \u201cI have told her you are here: come and let us see\nif she will know you.\u201d\n \nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often\nbeen summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before\nBessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was\nnow getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of\nold; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a\nhundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me\nuncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the\nslim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap\nout imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the\nbed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.\n \nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed\u2019s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image.\nIt is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the\npromptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate,\nand I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her\ngreat sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries\u2014to\nbe reconciled and clasp hands in amity.\n \nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever\u2014there was that\npeculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious,\ndespotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the\nrecollection of childhood\u2019s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh\nline now! And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.\n \n\u201cIs this Jane Eyre?\u201d she said.\n \n\u201cYes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?\u201d\n \nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to\nforget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay\noutside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have\nexperienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon\nsoftened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her\nhand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night\nwas warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of\nme\u2014her feeling towards me\u2014was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony\neye\u2014opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears\u2014that she was resolved to\nconsider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no\ngenerous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\n \nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue\nher\u2014to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had\nrisen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. I brought a\nchair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.\n \n\u201cYou sent for me,\u201d I said, \u201cand I am here; and it is my intention to stay till\nI see how you get on.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, of course! You have seen my daughters?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over\nwith you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in\nrecalling them. But there was something I wished to say\u2014let me see\u2014\u201d\n \nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her\nonce vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my\nelbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once\nirritated.\n \n\u201cSit up!\u201d said she; \u201cdon\u2019t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane\nEyre?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am Jane Eyre.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a\nburden to be left on my hands\u2014and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and\nhourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper,\nand her continual, unnatural watchings of one\u2019s movements! I declare she talked\nto me once like something mad, or like a fiend\u2014no child ever spoke or looked as\nshe did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did they do with her\nat Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She,\nhowever, did not die: but I said she did\u2014I wish she had died!\u201d\n \n\u201cA strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?\u201d\n \n\u201cI had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband\u2019s only sister,\nand a great favourite with him: he opposed the family\u2019s disowning her when she\nmade her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a\nsimpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it\nout to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my\neyes on it\u2014a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all\nnight long\u2014not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and\nmoaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had\nbeen his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would\ntry to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not\nbear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike. In his last\nillness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before\nhe died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been\ncharged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.\nJohn does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me\nand like my brothers\u2014he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting\nme with letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are getting\npoor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let\nit off. I can never submit to do that\u2014yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of\nmy income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John gambles dreadfully,\nand always loses\u2014poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and\ndegraded\u2014his look is frightful\u2014I feel ashamed for him when I see him.\u201d\n \nShe was getting much excited. \u201cI think I had better leave her now,\u201d said I to\nBessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\n \n\u201cPerhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night\u2014in the\nmorning she is calmer.\u201d\n \nI rose. \u201cStop!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Reed, \u201cthere is another thing I wished to say.\nHe threatens me\u2014he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I\ndream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or\nwith a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy\ntroubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?\u201d\n \nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she\nsucceeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank\ninto a dozing state. I then left her.\n \nMore than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her. She\ncontinued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything\nwhich could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with\nGeorgiana and Eliza. They were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit\nhalf the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to\nme or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the\nhour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for\noccupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they\nserved me for both.\n \nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a\nseat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy\nvignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in\nthe ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two\nrocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and\nwater-flags, and a naiad\u2019s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of\nthem; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow\u2019s nest, under a wreath of\nhawthorn-bloom.\n \nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did\nnot care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked\naway. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a\nsquare lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers\nproceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal\neyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a\nwell-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a\nflexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided\ncleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and\nsome jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for\nthe eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful\nworking. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and\nsombre; the irids lustrous and large. \u201cGood! but not quite the thing,\u201d I\nthought, as I surveyed the effect: \u201cthey want more force and spirit;\u201d and I\nwrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly\u2014a\nhappy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend\u2019s face under my gaze;\nand what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me? I\nlooked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\n \n\u201cIs that a portrait of some one you know?\u201d asked Eliza, who had approached me\nunnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath\nthe other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful\nrepresentation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any one but\nmyself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much,\nbut she called that \u201can ugly man.\u201d They both seemed surprised at my skill. I\noffered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.\nThen Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour\ndrawing: this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the\ngrounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential\nconversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter\nshe had spent in London two seasons ago\u2014of the admiration she had there\nexcited\u2014the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled\nconquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints\nwere enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental\nscenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was\nthat day improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from\nday to day: they always ran on the same theme\u2014herself, her loves, and woes. It\nwas strange she never once adverted either to her mother\u2019s illness, or her\nbrother\u2019s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind\nseemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after\ndissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother\u2019s\nsick-room, and no more.\n \nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a\nbusier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did:\nor rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an alarm to call\nher up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after\nthat meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its\nallotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on\ninspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great\nattraction of that volume, and she said, \u201cthe Rubric.\u201d Three hours she gave to\nstitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large\nenough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article,\nshe informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected\nnear Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself\nin the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She seemed to\nwant no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this\nroutine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of\nany incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\n \nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual,\nthat John\u2019s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source\nof profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and\nformed her resolution. Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when\nher mother died\u2014and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she\nshould either recover or linger long\u2014she would execute a long-cherished\nproject: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured\nfrom disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\nworld. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\n \n\u201cOf course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had.\nShe would not be burdened with her society for any consideration. Georgiana\nshould take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.\u201d\n \nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in\nlying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over\nand over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town.\n\u201cIt would be so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cif she could only get out of the way\nfor a month or two, till all was over.\u201d I did not ask what she meant by \u201call\nbeing over,\u201d but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother\nand the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of\nher sister\u2019s indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging\nobject had been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book\nand unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus\u2014\n \n\u201cGeorgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed\nto cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life.\nInstead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you\nseek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person\u2019s strength: if no one\ncan be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy,\nuseless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.\nThen, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and\nexcitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be\ncourted, you must be flattered\u2014you must have music, dancing, and society\u2014or you\nlanguish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make\nyou independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day;\nshare it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray\nunemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes\u2014include all; do each\npiece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will\nclose almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one\nfor helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one\u2019s\ncompany, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an\nindependent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall\noffer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect\nit\u2014go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling\u2014and suffer the results of\nyour idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I tell you this plainly;\nand listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I\nshall steadily act on it. After my mother\u2019s death, I wash my hands of you: from\nthe day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will\nbe as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that\nbecause we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten\nme down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this\u2014if the whole human\nrace, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth,\nI would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.\u201d\n \nShe closed her lips.\n \n\u201cYou might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,\u201d\nanswered Georgiana. \u201cEverybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless\ncreature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I\nhave had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin\nVere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be\nreceived into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the\nspy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.\u201d Georgiana took out her\nhandkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold,\nimpassable, and assiduously industrious.\n \nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two\nnatures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless\nfor the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but\njudgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human\ndeglutition.\n \nIt was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over\nthe perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint\u2019s-day service at the\nnew church\u2014for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather\never prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional\nduties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on\nweek-days as there were prayers.\n \nI bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay\nthere almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent attention:\nthe hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever\nshe could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could\nonly come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had\nexpected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic;\nher livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed\nthe fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now\ngaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.\n \nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: \u201cOne\nlies there,\u201d I thought, \u201cwho will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements.\nWhither will that spirit\u2014now struggling to quit its material tenement\u2014flit when\nat length released?\u201d\n \nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying\nwords\u2014her faith\u2014her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still\nlistening in thought to her well-remembered tones\u2014still picturing her pale and\nspiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid\ndeathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father\u2019s\nbosom\u2014when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: \u201cWho is that?\u201d\n \nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up to her.\n \n\u201cIt is I, Aunt Reed.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho\u2014I?\u201d was her answer. \u201cWho are you?\u201d looking at me with surprise and a sort\nof alarm, but still not wildly. \u201cYou are quite a stranger to me\u2014where is\nBessie?\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is at the lodge, aunt.\u201d\n \n\u201cAunt,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWho calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and\nyet I know you\u2014that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me:\nyou are like\u2014why, you are like Jane Eyre!\u201d\n \nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my\nidentity.\n \n\u201cYet,\u201d said she, \u201cI am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished\nto see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight\nyears she must be so changed.\u201d I now gently assured her that I was the person\nshe supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that\nher senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to\nfetch me from Thornfield.\n \n\u201cI am very ill, I know,\u201d she said ere long. \u201cI was trying to turn myself a few\nminutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my\nmind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an\nhour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room\nbut you?\u201d\n \nI assured her we were alone.\n \n\u201cWell, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking\nthe promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the\nother\u2014\u201d she stopped. \u201cAfter all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,\u201d she\nmurmured to herself: \u201cand then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her\nis painful.\u201d\n \nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she\nseemed to experience some inward sensation\u2014the precursor, perhaps, of the last\npang.\n \n\u201cWell, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.\u2014Go to\nmy dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.\u201d\n \nI obeyed her directions. \u201cRead the letter,\u201d she said.\n \nIt was short, and thus conceived:\u2014\n \n\u201cMADAM,\u2014\n\u201cWill you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and\nto tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to\ncome to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a\ncompetency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my\nlife, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.\n \nI am, Madam, &c., &c.,\n\u201cJOHN EYRE, Madeira.\u201d\n \nIt was dated three years back.\n \n\u201cWhy did I never hear of this?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cBecause I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in\nlifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane\u2014the fury\nwith which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred\nme the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which\nyou affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had\ntreated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when\nyou thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an\nanimal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and\ncursed me in a man\u2019s voice.\u2014Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!\u201d\n \n\u201cDear Mrs. Reed,\u201d said I, as I offered her the draught she required, \u201cthink no\nmore of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate\nlanguage: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.\u201d\n \nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn\nbreath, she went on thus\u2014\n \n\u201cI tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted\nby your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not\nendure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane\nEyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please:\nwrite and contradict my assertion\u2014expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You\nwere born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the\nrecollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to\ncommit.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me\nwith kindness and forgiveness\u2014\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have a very bad disposition,\u201d said she, \u201cand one to this day I feel it\nimpossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent\nunder any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can\nnever comprehend.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not\nvindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you\nif you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now:\nkiss me, aunt.\u201d\n \nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I oppressed\nher by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid her down\u2014for I\nraised her and supported her on my arm while she drank\u2014I covered her ice-cold\nand clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch\u2014the glazing\neyes shunned my gaze.\n \n\u201cLove me, then, or hate me, as you will,\u201d I said at last, \u201cyou have my full and\nfree forgiveness: ask now for God\u2019s, and be at peace.\u201d\n \nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change\nher habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me\u2014dying, she must hate\nme still.\n \nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer,\nhoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was fast relapsing\ninto stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o\u2019clock that night she\ndied. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters.\nThey came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time\nlaid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into\nloud weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed\u2019s once\nrobust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its\ncold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable\nsoul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with\ngloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or\nsubduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her woes\u2014not\nmy loss\u2014and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such\na form.\n \nEliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she observed\u2014\n \n\u201cWith her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was\nshortened by trouble.\u201d And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant:\nas it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had\ndropt a tear.\n",
        "\nMr. Rochester had given me but one week\u2019s leave of absence: yet a month elapsed\nbefore I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after the funeral,\nbut Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London, whither\nshe was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to\ndirect his sister\u2019s interment and settle the family affairs. Georgiana said she\ndreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her\ndejection, support in her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with\nher feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did\nmy best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that while I\nworked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, \u201cIf you and I were destined to\nlive always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.\nI should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should\nassign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it\nshould be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those\ndrawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only\nbecause our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly\nmournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on\nmy part.\u201d\n \nAt last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza\u2019s turn to request me to stay\nanother week. Her plans required all her time and attention, she said; she was\nabout to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she stayed in her own\nroom, her door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers,\nand holding no communication with any one. She wished me to look after the\nhouse, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence.\n \nOne morning she told me I was at liberty. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, \u201cI am obliged to\nyou for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There is some difference\nbetween living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own\npart in life and burden no one. To-morrow,\u201d she continued, \u201cI set out for the\nContinent. I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle\u2014a nunnery\nyou would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself\nfor a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful\nstudy of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it\nis, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in\norder, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.\u201d\n \nI neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her\nfrom it. \u201cThe vocation will fit you to a hair,\u201d I thought: \u201cmuch good may it do\nyou!\u201d\n \nWhen we parted, she said: \u201cGood-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you\nhave some sense.\u201d\n \nI then returned: \u201cYou are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I\nsuppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent. However,\nit is not my business, and so it suits you, I don\u2019t much care.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are in the right,\u201d said she; and with these words we each went our\nseparate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister\nagain, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match\nwith a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil,\nand is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her\nnovitiate, and which she endowed with her fortune.\n \nHow people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I\ndid not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had known what it was to\ncome back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for\nlooking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to\nLowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get\neither. Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet\ndrew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I\ncame. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.\n \nMy journey seemed tedious\u2014very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at\nan inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve hours I thought of\nMrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and discoloured face, and\nheard her strangely altered voice. I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the\nhearse, the black train of tenants and servants\u2014few was the number of\nrelatives\u2014the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service. Then I\nthought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the\nother the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate\npeculiarities of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of\n\u2014\u2014 scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on\nmy traveller\u2019s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.\n \nI was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not long; of\nthat I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence:\nthe party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three\nweeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax\nsurmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had\ntalked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss\nIngram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what\nshe had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly\ntake place. \u201cYou would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,\u201d was my\nmental comment. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d\n \nThe question followed, \u201cWhere was I to go?\u201d I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the\nnight: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield\nagainst me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with\nhis arms folded\u2014smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her and me.\n \nI had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not\nwish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed to walk the\ndistance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the\nostler\u2019s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o\u2019clock of a June\nevening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through\nfields, and was now little frequented.\n \nIt was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the\nhaymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from\ncloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue\u2014where blue was\nvisible\u2014was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin. The west,\ntoo, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it\u2014it seemed as if there was a fire lit,\nan altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures\nshone a golden redness.\n \nI felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask\nmyself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I\nwas going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends\nlooked out for me and waited my arrival. \u201cMrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm\nwelcome, to be sure,\u201d said I; \u201cand little Ad\u00e8le will clap her hands and jump to\nsee you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that\nhe is not thinking of you.\u201d\n \nBut what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience? These\naffirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on\nMr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they added\u2014\u201cHasten! hasten!\nbe with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are\nparted from him for ever!\u201d And then I strangled a new-born agony\u2014a deformed\nthing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear\u2014and ran on.\n \nThey are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are\njust quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their\nshoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field or two to traverse,\nand then I shall cross the road and reach the gates. How full the hedges are of\nroses! But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house. I passed a\ntall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the\nnarrow stile with stone steps; and I see\u2014Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book\nand a pencil in his hand; he is writing.\n \nWell, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am\nbeyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I should tremble in\nthis way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of motion in his\npresence. I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute\nfool of myself. I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew\ntwenty ways; for he has seen me.\n \n\u201cHillo!\u201d he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. \u201cThere you are! Come\non, if you please.\u201d\n \nI suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely\ncognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all,\nto control the working muscles of my face\u2014which I feel rebel insolently against\nmy will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal. But I have a\nveil\u2014it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure.\n \n\u201cAnd this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes\u2014just one\nof your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and\nroad like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along\nwith twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade. What the deuce have you\ndone with yourself this last month?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.\u201d\n \n\u201cA true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other\nworld\u2014from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me\nalone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I\u2019d touch you, to see if you are\nsubstance or shadow, you elf!\u2014but I\u2019d as soon offer to take hold of a blue\nignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! truant!\u201d he added, when he had\npaused an instant. \u201cAbsent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I\u2019ll\nbe sworn!\u201d\n \nI knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken\nby the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge\nthat I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr. Rochester (so at least I\nthought) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste\nbut of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to\nfeast genially. His last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported\nsomething to him whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield\nas my home\u2014would that it were my home!\n \nHe did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I inquired soon\nif he had not been to London.\n \n\u201cYes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.\u201d\n \n\u201cMrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd did she inform you what I went to do?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don\u2019t think it will suit\nMrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won\u2019t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning\nback against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better\nadapted to match with her externally. Tell me now, fairy as you are\u2014can\u2019t you\ngive me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome\nman?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would be past the power of magic, sir;\u201d and, in thought, I added, \u201cA loving\neye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your\nsternness has a power beyond beauty.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me\nincomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal\nresponse; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own, and which\nhe used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think it too good for common\npurposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling\u2014he shed it over me now.\n \n\u201cPass, Janet,\u201d said he, making room for me to cross the stile: \u201cgo up home, and\nstay your weary little wandering feet at a friend\u2019s threshold.\u201d\n \nAll I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to colloquise\nfurther. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him calmly. An\nimpulse held me fast\u2014a force turned me round. I said\u2014or something in me said\nfor me, and in spite of me\u2014\n \n\u201cThank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get\nback again to you: and wherever you are is my home\u2014my only home.\u201d\n \nI walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried.\nLittle Ad\u00e8le was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs. Fairfax received\nme with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me \u201cbon\nsoir\u201d with glee. This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of\nbeing loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an\naddition to their comfort.\n \nI that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my ears\nagainst the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief.\nWhen tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a\nlow seat near her, and Ad\u00e8le, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to\nme, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden\npeace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but\nwhen, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us,\nseemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable\u2014when he said he\nsupposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter\nback again, and added that he saw Ad\u00e8le was \u201cpr\u00eate \u00e0 croquer sa petite maman\nAnglaise\u201d\u2014I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep\nus together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled\nfrom the sunshine of his presence.\n \nA fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall. Nothing was\nsaid of the master\u2019s marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an\nevent. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything\ndecided: her answer was always in the negative. Once she said she had actually\nput the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride\nhome; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and\nshe could not tell what to make of him.\n \nOne thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings\nbackward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles\noff, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent\nlover? To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would\nbe but a morning\u2019s ride. I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive:\nthat the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both\nparties had changed their minds. I used to look at my master\u2019s face to see if\nit were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so\nuniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and my pupil\nspent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became\neven gay. Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been\nkinder to me when there\u2014and, alas! never had I loved him so well.\n",
        "\nA splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were\nthen seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-girt land. It\nwas as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of\nglorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion. The\nhay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads\nwhite and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood,\nfull-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the\ncleared meadows between.\n \nOn Midsummer-eve, Ad\u00e8le, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane\nhalf the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop asleep, and when\nI left her, I sought the garden.\n \nIt was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:\u2014\u201cDay its fervid fires had\nwasted,\u201d and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit. Where the sun\nhad gone down in simple state\u2014pure of the pomp of clouds\u2014spread a solemn\npurple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on\none hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half\nheaven. The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a\nrising and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath\nthe horizon.\n \nI walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent\u2014that of a\ncigar\u2014stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I\nknew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in\nthe grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed\nwith flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the\nother, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk\nfence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with\nlaurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a\nseat, led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such honey-dew\nfell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt\nsuch shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the\nupper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon\ncast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed\u2014not by sound, not by sight,\nbut once more by a warning fragrance.\n \nSweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding\ntheir evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor\nflower; it is\u2014I know it well\u2014it is Mr. Rochester\u2019s cigar. I look round and I\nlisten. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I hear a nightingale warbling in\na wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but\nthat perfume increases: I must flee. I make for the wicket leading to the\nshrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess;\nhe will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still\nhe will never see me.\n \nBut no\u2014eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden as\nattractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look\nat the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe\ncherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale\ntheir fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes\nhumming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester\u2019s foot: he sees it, and\nbends to examine it.\n \n\u201cNow, he has his back towards me,\u201d thought I, \u201cand he is occupied too; perhaps,\nif I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.\u201d\n \nI trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not\nbetray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I\nhad to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. \u201cI shall get by very well,\u201d I\nmeditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon,\nnot yet risen high, he said quietly, without turning\u2014\n \n\u201cJane, come and look at this fellow.\u201d\n \nI had made no noise: he had not eyes behind\u2014could his shadow feel? I started at\nfirst, and then I approached him.\n \n\u201cLook at his wings,\u201d said he, \u201che reminds me rather of a West Indian insect;\none does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there! he is\nflown.\u201d\n \nThe moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. Rochester\nfollowed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said\u2014\n \n\u201cTurn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely\nno one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.\u201d\n \nIt is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an\nanswer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always\nthe lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is\nspecially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment. I did not like to walk\nat this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not\nfind a reason to allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and\nthoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself\nlooked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any\nconfusion: the evil\u2014if evil existent or prospective there was\u2014seemed to lie\nwith me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.\n \n\u201cJane,\u201d he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down\nin the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, \u201cThornfield is a\npleasant place in summer, is it not?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou must have become in some degree attached to the house,\u2014you, who have an\neye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am attached to it, indeed.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd though I don\u2019t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree\nof regard for that foolish little child Ad\u00e8le, too; and even for simple dame\nFairfax?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd would be sorry to part with them?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cPity!\u201d he said, and sighed and paused. \u201cIt is always the way of events in this\nlife,\u201d he continued presently: \u201cno sooner have you got settled in a pleasant\nresting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour\nof repose is expired.\u201d\n \n\u201cMust I move on, sir?\u201d I asked. \u201cMust I leave Thornfield?\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must.\u201d\n \nThis was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.\n \n\u201cWell, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is come now\u2014I must give it to-night.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you are going to be married, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cEx-act-ly\u2014pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail\nstraight on the head.\u201d\n \n\u201cSoon, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery soon, my\u2014that is, Miss Eyre: and you\u2019ll remember, Jane, the first time I,\nor Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old\nbachelor\u2019s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of\nmatrimony\u2014to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she\u2019s an extensive armful:\nbut that\u2019s not to the point\u2014one can\u2019t have too much of such a very excellent\nthing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying\u2014listen to me, Jane!\nYou\u2019re not turning your head to look after more moths, are you? That was only a\nlady-clock, child, \u2018flying away home.\u2019 I wish to remind you that it was you who\nfirst said to me, with that discretion I respect in you\u2014with that foresight,\nprudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position\u2014that\nin case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Ad\u00e8le had better trot\nforthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the\ncharacter of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I\u2019ll try to\nforget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my\nlaw of action. Ad\u00e8le must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new\nsituation.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose\u2014\u201d I was going\nto say, \u201cI suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake\nmyself to:\u201d but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for\nmy voice was not quite under command.\n \n\u201cIn about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,\u201d continued Mr. Rochester; \u201cand in\nthe interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.\u201d\n \n\u201cThank you, sir; I am sorry to give\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her duty as\nwell as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any\nlittle assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already,\nthrough my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is\nto undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O\u2019Gall of\nBitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland. You\u2019ll like Ireland, I think: they\u2019re\nsuch warm-hearted people there, they say.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is a long way off, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo matter\u2014a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cFrom what, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cFrom England and from Thornfield: and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d\n \n\u201cFrom you, sir.\u201d\n \nI said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my\ntears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing.\nThe thought of Mrs. O\u2019Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and\ncolder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush\nbetween me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the\nremembrance of the wider ocean\u2014wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and\nwhat I naturally and inevitably loved.\n \n\u201cIt is a long way,\u201d I again said.\n \n\u201cIt is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I\nshall never see you again, Jane: that\u2019s morally certain. I never go over to\nIreland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country. We have been good\nfriends, Jane; have we not?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little\ntime that remains to them close to each other. Come! we\u2019ll talk over the voyage\nand the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their\nshining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench\nat its old roots. Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should\nnever more be destined to sit there together.\u201d He seated me and himself.\n \n\u201cIt is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on\nsuch weary travels: but if I can\u2019t do better, how is it to be helped? Are you\nanything akin to me, do you think, Jane?\u201d\n \nI could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\n \n\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201cI sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to\nyou\u2014especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string\nsomewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar\nstring situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that\nboisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us,\nI am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I\u2019ve a nervous\nnotion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,\u2014you\u2019d forget me.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat I never should, sir: you know\u2014\u201d Impossible to proceed.\n \n\u201cJane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!\u201d\n \nIn listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no\nlonger; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute\ndistress. When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had\nnever been born, or never come to Thornfield.\n \n\u201cBecause you are sorry to leave it?\u201d\n \nThe vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was claiming\nmastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to\novercome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,\u2014and to speak.\n \n\u201cI grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:\u2014I love it, because I have\nlived in it a full and delightful life,\u2014momentarily at least. I have not been\ntrampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been buried with inferior\nminds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and\nenergetic and high. I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with\nwhat I delight in,\u2014with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known\nyou, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I\nabsolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure;\nand it is like looking on the necessity of death.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere do you see the necessity?\u201d he asked suddenly.\n \n\u201cWhere? You, sir, have placed it before me.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn what shape?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,\u2014your bride.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy bride! What bride? I have no bride!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you will have.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes;\u2014I will!\u2014I will!\u201d He set his teeth.\n \n\u201cThen I must go:\u2014you have said it yourself.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: you must stay! I swear it\u2014and the oath shall be kept.\u201d\n \n\u201cI tell you I must go!\u201d I retorted, roused to something like passion. \u201cDo you\nthink I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?\u2014a\nmachine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from\nmy lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because\nI am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think\nwrong!\u2014I have as much soul as you,\u2014and full as much heart! And if God had\ngifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for\nyou to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now\nthrough the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;\u2014it\nis my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the\ngrave, and we stood at God\u2019s feet, equal,\u2014as we are!\u201d\n \n\u201cAs we are!\u201d repeated Mr. Rochester\u2014\u201cso,\u201d he added, enclosing me in his arms,\ngathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: \u201cso, Jane!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, so, sir,\u201d I rejoined: \u201cand yet not so; for you are a married man\u2014or as\ngood as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you\u2014to one with whom you have\nno sympathy\u2014whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you\nsneer at her. I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you\u2014let me\ngo!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere, Jane? To Ireland?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, be still; don\u2019t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending\nits own plumage in its desperation.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an\nindependent will, which I now exert to leave you.\u201d\n \nAnother effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\n \n\u201cAnd your will shall decide your destiny,\u201d he said: \u201cI offer you my hand, my\nheart, and a share of all my possessions.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou play a farce, which I merely laugh at.\u201d\n \n\u201cI ask you to pass through life at my side\u2014to be my second self, and best\nearthly companion.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.\u201d\n \nA waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the\nboughs of the chestnut: it wandered away\u2014away\u2014to an indefinite distance\u2014it\ndied. The nightingale\u2019s song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening\nto it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and\nseriously. Some time passed before he spoke; he at last said\u2014\n \n\u201cCome to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.\u201d\n \nI was silent: I thought he mocked me.\n \n\u201cCome, Jane\u2014come hither.\u201d\n \n\u201cYour bride stands between us.\u201d\n \nHe rose, and with a stride reached me.\n \n\u201cMy bride is here,\u201d he said, again drawing me to him, \u201cbecause my equal is\nhere, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?\u201d\n \nStill I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I was\nstill incredulous.\n \n\u201cDo you doubt me, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have no faith in me?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot a whit.\u201d\n \n\u201cAm I a liar in your eyes?\u201d he asked passionately. \u201cLittle sceptic, you\nshall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that you\nknow. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused\na rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and\nafter that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her\nand her mother. I would not\u2014I could not\u2014marry Miss Ingram. You\u2014you strange, you\nalmost unearthly thing!\u2014I love as my own flesh. You\u2014poor and obscure, and small\nand plain as you are\u2014I entreat to accept me as a husband.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat, me!\u201d I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness\u2014and especially in his\nincivility\u2014to credit his sincerity: \u201cme who have not a friend in the world but\nyou\u2014if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have given me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou, Jane, I must have you for my own\u2014entirely my own. Will you be mine? Say\nyes, quickly.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I want to read your countenance\u2014turn!\u201d\n \n\u201cThere! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page.\nRead on: only make haste, for I suffer.\u201d\n \nHis face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong\nworkings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.\n \n\u201cOh, Jane, you torture me!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWith that searching and yet faithful\nand generous look, you torture me!\u201d\n \n\u201cHow can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to\nyou must be gratitude and devotion\u2014they cannot torture.\u201d\n \n\u201cGratitude!\u201d he ejaculated; and added wildly\u2014\u201cJane accept me quickly. Say,\nEdward\u2014give me my name\u2014Edward\u2014I will marry you.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to be your\nwife?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, sir, I will marry you.\u201d\n \n\u201cEdward\u2014my little wife!\u201d\n \n\u201cDear Edward!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome to me\u2014come to me entirely now,\u201d said he; and added, in his deepest tone,\nspeaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, \u201cMake my happiness\u2014I will\nmake yours.\u201d\n \n\u201cGod pardon me!\u201d he subjoined ere long; \u201cand man meddle not with me: I have\nher, and will hold her.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014that is the best of it,\u201d he said. And if I had loved him less I should have\nthought his accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by him, roused\nfrom the nightmare of parting\u2014called to the paradise of union\u2014I thought only of\nthe bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow. Again and again he said,\n\u201cAre you happy, Jane?\u201d And again and again I answered, \u201cYes.\u201d After which he\nmurmured, \u201cIt will atone\u2014it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and\ncold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there\nnot love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at God\u2019s\ntribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world\u2019s judgment\u2014I wash\nmy hands thereof. For man\u2019s opinion\u2014I defy it.\u201d\n \nBut what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in\nshadow: I could scarcely see my master\u2019s face, near as I was. And what ailed\nthe chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel\nwalk, and came sweeping over us.\n \n\u201cWe must go in,\u201d said Mr. Rochester: \u201cthe weather changes. I could have sat\nwith thee till morning, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd so,\u201d thought I, \u201ccould I with you.\u201d I should have said so, perhaps, but a\nlivid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and there was a\ncrack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only of hiding my\ndazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester\u2019s shoulder.\n \nThe rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds, and into\nthe house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold. He was\ntaking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my loosened hair,\nwhen Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room. I did not observe her at first, nor\ndid Mr. Rochester. The lamp was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.\n \n\u201cHasten to take off your wet things,\u201d said he; \u201cand before you go,\ngood-night\u2014good-night, my darling!\u201d\n \nHe kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there stood the\nwidow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs.\n\u201cExplanation will do for another time,\u201d thought I. Still, when I reached my\nchamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what\nshe had seen. But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind\nblew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the\nlightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours\u2019\nduration, I experienced no fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my\ndoor in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was\ncomfort, that was strength for anything.\n \nBefore I left my bed in the morning, little Ad\u00e8le came running in to tell me\nthat the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by\nlightning in the night, and half of it split away.\n",
        "\nAs I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it\nwere a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr.\nRochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.\n \nWhile arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no\nlonger plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes\nseemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the\nlustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I\nfeared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face\nto his now, and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but\nclean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire\nhad ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.\n \nI was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant\nJune morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through\nthe open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must\nbe gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy\u2014pale, ragged\nobjects both\u2014were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the\nmoney I happened to have in my purse\u2014some three or four shillings: good or bad,\nthey must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but\nnothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.\n \nMrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad countenance,\nand saying gravely\u2014\u201cMiss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?\u201d During the meal she\nwas quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her then. I must wait for my\nmaster to give explanations; and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I\nhastened upstairs. I met Ad\u00e8le leaving the schoolroom.\n \n\u201cWhere are you going? It is time for lessons.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn there,\u201d pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and there he\nstood.\n \n\u201cCome and bid me good-morning,\u201d said he. I gladly advanced; and it was not\nmerely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an\nembrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so\ncaressed by him.\n \n\u201cJane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,\u201d said he: \u201ctruly pretty this\nmorning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my mustard-seed? This little\nsunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel\nhair, and the radiant hazel eyes?\u201d (I had green eyes, reader; but you must\nexcuse the mistake: for him they were new-dyed, I suppose.)\n \n\u201cIt is Jane Eyre, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cSoon to be Jane Rochester,\u201d he added: \u201cin four weeks, Janet; not a day more.\nDo you hear that?\u201d\n \nI did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The feeling, the\nannouncement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with\njoy\u2014something that smote and stunned: it was, I think, almost fear.\n \n\u201cYou blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause you gave me a new name\u2014Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Mrs. Rochester,\u201d said he; \u201cyoung Mrs. Rochester\u2014Fairfax Rochester\u2019s\ngirl-bride.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never enjoy\ncomplete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different destiny to the\nrest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is a fairy tale\u2014a\nday-dream.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This morning I wrote to my\nbanker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his keeping,\u2014heirlooms for\nthe ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap:\nfor every privilege, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a\npeer\u2019s daughter, if about to marry her.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, sir!\u2014never rain jewels! I don\u2019t like to hear them spoken of. Jewels for\nJane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have them.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on your\nforehead,\u2014which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped her patent of\nnobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine\nwrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in\nanother strain. Don\u2019t address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,\nQuakerish governess.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my\nheart,\u2014delicate and a\u00ebrial.\u201d\n \n\u201cPuny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,\u2014or you are sneering.\nFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t be ironical!\u201d\n \n\u201cI will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,\u201d he went on, while I\nreally became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he was either\ndeluding himself or trying to delude me. \u201cI will attire my Jane in satin and\nlace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will cover the head I love\nbest with a priceless veil.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd then you won\u2019t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer,\nbut an ape in a harlequin\u2019s jacket\u2014a jay in borrowed plumes. I would as soon\nsee you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a\ncourt-lady\u2019s robe; and I don\u2019t call you handsome, sir, though I love you most\ndearly: far too dearly to flatter you. Don\u2019t flatter me.\u201d\n \nHe pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. \u201cThis very day\nI shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses\nfor yourself. I told you we shall be married in four weeks. The wedding is to\ntake place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you\naway at once to town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to\nregions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall\nsee whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too,\nof the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison\nwith others.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall I travel?\u2014and with you, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna:\nall the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you: wherever I\nstamped my hoof, your sylph\u2019s foot shall step also. Ten years since, I flew\nthrough Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I\nshall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter.\u201d\n \nI laughed at him as he said this. \u201cI am not an angel,\u201d I asserted; \u201cand I will\nnot be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect\nnor exact anything celestial of me\u2014for you will not get it, any more than I\nshall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you anticipate of me?\u201d\n \n\u201cFor a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,\u2014a very little while;\nand then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will\nbe stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when you get well used\nto me, you will perhaps like me again,\u2014like me, I say, not love\nme. I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed\nin books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a\nhusband\u2019s ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope\nnever to become quite distasteful to my dear master.\u201d\n \n\u201cDistasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and yet\nagain: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but love\nyou\u2014with truth, fervour, constancy.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet are you not capricious, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find\nout they have neither souls nor hearts\u2014when they open to me a perspective of\nflatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but\nto the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the\ncharacter that bends but does not break\u2014at once supple and stable, tractable\nand consistent\u2014I am ever tender and true.\u201d\n \n\u201cHad you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love such an\none?\u201d\n \n\u201cI love it now.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult\nstandard?\u201d\n \n\u201cI never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me\u2014you seem to\nsubmit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the\nsoft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart. I\nam influenced\u2014conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and\nthe conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you\nsmile, Jane? What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance\nmean?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I was\nthinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYou were, you little elfish\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHush, sir! You don\u2019t talk very wisely just now; any more than those gentlemen\nacted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would no doubt by their\nseverity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors; and so will\nyou, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a\nfavour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant.\u201d\n \n\u201cAsk me something now, Janet,\u2014the least thing: I desire to be entreated\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.\u201d\n \n\u201cSpeak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall swear\nconcession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all, sir; I ask only this: don\u2019t send for the jewels, and don\u2019t crown\nme with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain\npocket handkerchief you have there.\u201d\n \n\u201cI might as well \u2018gild refined gold.\u2019 I know it: your request is granted\nthen\u2014for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my banker. But you\nhave not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try\nagain.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much\npiqued on one point.\u201d\n \nHe looked disturbed. \u201cWhat? what?\u201d he said hastily. \u201cCuriosity is a dangerous\npetition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cUtter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a\nsecret, it was a wish for half my estate.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I am a\nJew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much rather have all your\nconfidence. You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to\nyour heart?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God\u2019s\nsake, don\u2019t desire a useless burden! Don\u2019t long for poison\u2014don\u2019t turn out a\ndownright Eve on my hands!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be\nconquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don\u2019t you think I had\nbetter take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat\u2014even\ncry and be sulky if necessary\u2014for the sake of a mere essay of my power?\u201d\n \n\u201cI dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is up.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows have\nbecome as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very\nastonishing poetry, I once saw styled, \u2018a blue-piled thunderloft.\u2019 That will be\nyour married look, sir, I suppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up\nthe notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what had you to\nask, thing,\u2014out with it?\u201d\n \n\u201cThere, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal better\nthan flattery. I had rather be a thing than an angel. This is what I\nhave to ask,\u2014Why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry\nMiss Ingram?\u201d\n \n\u201cIs that all? Thank God it is no worse!\u201d And now he unknit his black brows;\nlooked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well pleased at seeing a\ndanger averted. \u201cI think I may confess,\u201d he continued, \u201ceven although I should\nmake you a little indignant, Jane\u2014and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be\nwhen you are indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you\nmutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet, by-the-bye, it\nwas you who made me the offer.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course I did. But to the point if you please, sir\u2014Miss Ingram?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as\nmadly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the best\nally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.\u201d\n \n\u201cExcellent! Now you are small\u2014not one whit bigger than the end of my little\nfinger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way.\nDid you think nothing of Miss Ingram\u2019s feelings, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cHer feelings are concentrated in one\u2014pride; and that needs humbling. Were you\njealous, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know that.\nAnswer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your\ndishonest coquetry? Won\u2019t she feel forsaken and deserted?\u201d\n \n\u201cImpossible!\u2014when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of\nmy insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your principles\non some points are eccentric.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little awry for\nwant of attention.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnce again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to\nme, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself\nfelt a while ago?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the world has\nthe same pure love for me as yourself\u2014for I lay that pleasant unction to my\nsoul, Jane, a belief in your affection.\u201d\n \nI turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very\nmuch\u2014more than I could trust myself to say\u2014more than words had power to\nexpress.\n \n\u201cAsk something more,\u201d he said presently; \u201cit is my delight to be entreated, and\nto yield.\u201d\n \nI was again ready with my request. \u201cCommunicate your intentions to Mrs.\nFairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked.\nGive her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me to be misjudged\nby so good a woman.\u201d\n \n\u201cGo to your room, and put on your bonnet,\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean you to accompany\nme to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the drive, I will\nenlighten the old lady\u2019s understanding. Did she think, Janet, you had given the\nworld for love, and considered it well lost?\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cStation! station!\u2014your station is in my heart, and on the necks of those who\nwould insult you, now or hereafter.\u2014Go.\u201d\n \nI was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s parlour,\nI hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her morning portion of\nScripture\u2014the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open before her, and her\nspectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended by Mr. Rochester\u2019s\nannouncement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on the blank wall opposite,\nexpressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me,\nshe roused herself: she made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words\nof congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned\nunfinished. She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair\nback from the table.\n \n\u201cI feel so astonished,\u201d she began, \u201cI hardly know what to say to you, Miss\nEyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half fall asleep\nwhen I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. It has\nseemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband,\nwho died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I\nhave even heard him call me by my name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you\ntell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry\nhim? Don\u2019t laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago,\nand said that in a month you would be his wife.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe has said the same thing to me,\u201d I replied.\n \n\u201cHe has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \nShe looked at me bewildered.\n \n\u201cI could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were\nproud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always been called\ncareful. He means to marry you?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe tells me so.\u201d\n \nShe surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there found no\ncharm powerful enough to solve the enigma.\n \n\u201cIt passes me!\u201d she continued; \u201cbut no doubt it is true since you say so. How\nit will answer, I cannot tell: I really don\u2019t know. Equality of position and\nfortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of\ndifference in your ages. He might almost be your father.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d exclaimed I, nettled; \u201che is nothing like my\nfather! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant. Mr.\nRochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-twenty.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it really for love he is going to marry you?\u201d she asked.\n \nI was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.\n \n\u201cI am sorry to grieve you,\u201d pursued the widow; \u201cbut you are so young, and so\nlittle acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard. It is an old\nsaying that \u2018all is not gold that glitters;\u2019 and in this case I do fear there\nwill be something found to be different to what either you or I expect.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy?\u2014am I a monster?\u201d I said: \u201cis it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have\na sincere affection for me?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I\ndaresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of\nhis. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his\nmarked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like\nto suggest even the possibility of wrong. I knew such an idea would shock,\nperhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and\nsensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot\ntell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you\nnowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o\u2019clock, saw you come in\nwith him.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, never mind that now,\u201d I interrupted impatiently; \u201cit is enough that all\nwas right.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope all will be right in the end,\u201d she said: \u201cbut believe me, you cannot be\ntoo careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust yourself as\nwell as him. Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their\ngovernesses.\u201d\n \nI was growing truly irritated: happily, Ad\u00e8le ran in.\n \n\u201cLet me go,\u2014let me go to Millcote too!\u201d she cried. \u201cMr. Rochester won\u2019t: though\nthere is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let me go, mademoiselle.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat I will, Ad\u00e8le;\u201d and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my gloomy\nmonitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to the front,\nand my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him backwards and\nforwards.\n \n\u201cAd\u00e8le may accompany us, may she not, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cI told her no. I\u2019ll have no brats!\u2014I\u2019ll have only you.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot it: she will be a restraint.\u201d\n \nHe was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s\nwarnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of\nunsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the sense of\npower over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without further\nremonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at my face.\n \n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he asked; \u201call the sunshine is gone. Do you really wish\nthe bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?\u201d\n \n\u201cI would far rather she went, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!\u201d cried he to\nAd\u00e8le.\n \nShe obeyed him with what speed she might.\n \n\u201cAfter all, a single morning\u2019s interruption will not matter much,\u201d said he,\n\u201cwhen I mean shortly to claim you\u2014your thoughts, conversation, and company\u2014for\nlife.\u201d\n \nAd\u00e8le, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her gratitude\nfor my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a corner on the other\nside of him. She then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too\nrestrictive: to him, in his present fractious mood, she dared whisper no\nobservations, nor ask of him any information.\n \n\u201cLet her come to me,\u201d I entreated: \u201cshe will, perhaps, trouble you, sir: there\nis plenty of room on this side.\u201d\n \nHe handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. \u201cI\u2019ll send her to school yet,\u201d\nhe said, but now he was smiling.\n \nAd\u00e8le heard him, and asked if she was to go to school \u201csans mademoiselle?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cabsolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take mademoiselle\nto the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among\nthe volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,\u201d observed Ad\u00e8le.\n \n\u201cI shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides in\nthe moon are bleached with manna, Ad\u00e8le.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?\u201d\n \n\u201cFire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I\u2019ll carry her up to\na peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, qu\u2019elle y sera mal\u2014peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will wear out:\nhow can she get new ones?\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. \u201cHem!\u201d said he. \u201cWhat would you do,\nAd\u00e8le? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a pink cloud\nanswer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of\na rainbow.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is far better as she is,\u201d concluded Ad\u00e8le, after musing some time:\n\u201cbesides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I were\nmademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe has consented: she has pledged her word.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you can\u2019t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and\nneither you nor she can fly.\u201d\n \n\u201cAd\u00e8le, look at that field.\u201d We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling\nlightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the\nthunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side\nglistened green and rain-refreshed.\n \n\u201cIn that field, Ad\u00e8le, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight\nsince\u2014the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows;\nand, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and\nthere I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a\nmisfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I\nwas writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when\nsomething came up the path and stopped two yards off me. I looked at it. It was\na little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near\nme; it stood soon at my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in\nwords; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was\nto this effect\u2014\n \n\u201cIt was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me\nhappy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place\u2014such as the\nmoon, for instance\u2014and it nodded its head towards her horn, rising over\nHay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live.\nI said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings\nto fly.\n \n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 returned the fairy, \u2018that does not signify! Here is a talisman will\nremove all difficulties;\u2019 and she held out a pretty gold ring. \u2018Put it,\u2019 she\nsaid, \u2018on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine;\nand we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.\u2019 She nodded again at\nthe moon. The ring, Ad\u00e8le, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a\nsovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don\u2019t care for the fairy: you said\nit was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?\u201d\n \n\u201cMademoiselle is a fairy,\u201d he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told\nher not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund of genuine\nFrench scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester \u201cun vrai menteur,\u201d and assuring\nhim that she made no account whatever of his \u201ccontes de f\u00e9e,\u201d and that \u201cdu\nreste, il n\u2019y avait pas de f\u00e9es, et quand m\u00eame il y en avait:\u201d she was sure\nthey would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with\nhim in the moon.\n \nThe hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester\nobliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose\nhalf-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no\u2014it\nshould be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic\nwhispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he vowed he would\nselect himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he\nfixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink\nsatin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a\ngold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear\nhis choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\npersuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\npearl-grey silk. \u201cIt might pass for the present,\u201d he said; \u201cbut he would yet\nsee me glittering like a parterre.\u201d\n \nGlad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jeweller\u2019s\nshop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance\nand degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and\nfagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had\nwholly forgotten\u2014the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention\nto adopt me and make me his legatee. \u201cIt would, indeed, be a relief,\u201d I\nthought, \u201cif I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being\ndressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the\ngolden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get\nhome, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had\nbut a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I\ncould better endure to be kept by him now.\u201d And somewhat relieved by this idea\n(which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my\nmaster\u2019s and lover\u2019s eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I\naverted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a\nsultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and\ngems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,\nand thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.\n \n\u201cYou need not look in that way,\u201d I said; \u201cif you do, I\u2019ll wear nothing but my\nold Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I\u2019ll be married in this lilac\ngingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk,\nand an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin.\u201d\n \nHe chuckled; he rubbed his hands. \u201cOh, it is rich to see and hear her!\u201d he\nexclaimed. \u201cIs she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange this one\nlittle English girl for the Grand Turk\u2019s whole seraglio, gazelle-eyes, houri\nforms, and all!\u201d\n \nThe Eastern allusion bit me again. \u201cI\u2019ll not stand you an inch in the stead of\na seraglio,\u201d I said; \u201cso don\u2019t consider me an equivalent for one. If you have a\nfancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul\nwithout delay, and lay out in extensive slave-purchases some of that spare cash\nyou seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of flesh\nand such an assortment of black eyes?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them\nthat are enslaved\u2014your harem inmates amongst the rest. I\u2019ll get admitted there,\nand I\u2019ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in\na trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent\nto cut your bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot\never yet conferred.\u201d\n \n\u201cI would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cI would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an eye\nlike that. While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever charter you\nmight grant under coercion, your first act, when released, would be to violate\nits conditions.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go through a\nprivate marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar. You will\nstipulate, I see, for peculiar terms\u2014what will they be?\u201d\n \n\u201cI only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do you\nremember what you said of C\u00e9line Varens?\u2014of the diamonds, the cashmeres you\ngave her? I will not be your English C\u00e9line Varens. I shall continue to act as\nAd\u00e8le\u2019s governess; by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds\na year besides. I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall\ngive me nothing but\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, but what?\u201d\n \n\u201cYour regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven\u2019t your\nequal,\u201d said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. \u201cWill it please you to\ndine with me to-day?\u201d he asked, as we re-entered the gates.\n \n\u201cNo, thank you, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what for, \u2018no, thank you?\u2019 if one may inquire.\u201d\n \n\u201cI never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cTill what? You delight in half-phrases.\u201d\n \n\u201cTill I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the\ncompanion of my repast?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual\nfor another month.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will give up your governessing slavery at once.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with it as\nusual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been accustomed to do:\nyou may send for me in the evening, when you feel disposed to see me, and I\u2019ll\ncome then; but at no other time.\u201d\n \n\u201cI want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, \u2018pour\nme donner une contenance,\u2019 as Ad\u00e8le would say; and unfortunately I have neither\nmy cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But listen\u2014whisper. It is your time now,\nlittle tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when once I have fairly\nseized you, to have and to hold, I\u2019ll just\u2014figuratively speaking\u2014attach you to\na chain like this\u201d (touching his watch-guard). \u201cYes, bonny wee thing, I\u2019ll wear\nyou in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.\u201d\n \nHe said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he\nafterwards lifted out Ad\u00e8le, I entered the house, and made good my retreat\nupstairs.\n \nHe duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an\noccupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a\nt\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked\nto sing\u2014good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and, in his\nfastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in listening when the\nperformance was good. No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to\nlower her blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the\npiano, and entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song. He said I\nwas a capricious witch, and that he would rather sing another time; but I\naverred that no time was like the present.\n \n\u201cDid I like his voice?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cVery much.\u201d I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his; but\nfor once, and from motives of expediency, I would e\u2019en soothe and stimulate it.\n \n\u201cThen, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well, sir, I will try.\u201d\n \nI did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated \u201ca little\nbungler.\u201d Being pushed unceremoniously to one side\u2014which was precisely what I\nwished\u2014he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could\nplay as well as sing. I hied me to the window-recess. And while I sat there and\nlooked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow\ntones the following strain:\u2014\n \n\u201cThe truest love that ever heart\nFelt at its kindled core,\nDid through each vein, in quickened start,\nThe tide of being pour.\n\nHer coming was my hope each day,\nHer parting was my pain;\nThe chance that did her steps delay\nWas ice in every vein.\n\nI dreamed it would be nameless bliss,\nAs I loved, loved to be;\nAnd to this object did I press\nAs blind as eagerly.\n\nBut wide as pathless was the space\nThat lay our lives between,\nAnd dangerous as the foamy race\nOf ocean-surges green.\n\nAnd haunted as a robber-path\nThrough wilderness or wood;\nFor Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,\nBetween our spirits stood.\n\nI dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;\nI omens did defy:\nWhatever menaced, harassed, warned,\nI passed impetuous by.\n\nOn sped my rainbow, fast as light;\nI flew as in a dream;\nFor glorious rose upon my sight\nThat child of Shower and Gleam.\n\nStill bright on clouds of suffering dim\nShines that soft, solemn joy;\nNor care I now, how dense and grim\nDisasters gather nigh.\n\nI care not in this moment sweet,\nThough all I have rushed o\u2019er\nShould come on pinion, strong and fleet,\nProclaiming vengeance sore:\n\nThough haughty Hate should strike me down,\nRight, bar approach to me,\nAnd grinding Might, with furious frown,\nSwear endless enmity.\n\nMy love has placed her little hand\nWith noble faith in mine,\nAnd vowed that wedlock\u2019s sacred band\nOur nature shall entwine.\n\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\nWith me to live\u2014to die;\nI have at last my nameless bliss.\nAs I love\u2014loved am I!\u201d\n \nHe rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full\nfalcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament. I quailed\nmomentarily\u2014then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have;\nand I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be prepared\u2014I whetted my\ntongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity, \u201cwhom he was going to marry\nnow?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his\nfuture wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a pagan idea? I had\nno intention of dying with him\u2014he might depend on that.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him! Death\nwas not for such as I.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had: but I\nshould bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.\u201d\n \n\u201cWould I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling\nkiss?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: I would rather be excused.\u201d\n \nHere I heard myself apostrophised as a \u201chard little thing;\u201d and it was added,\n\u201cany other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas\ncrooned in her praise.\u201d\n \nI assured him I was naturally hard\u2014very flinty, and that he would often find me\nso; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my\ncharacter before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort\nof a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.\n \n\u201cWould I be quiet and talk rationally?\u201d\n \n\u201cI would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself\nI was doing that now.\u201d\n \nHe fretted, pished, and pshawed. \u201cVery good,\u201d I thought; \u201cyou may fume and\nfidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am\ncertain. I like you more than I can say; but I\u2019ll not sink into a bathos of\nsentiment: and with this needle of repartee I\u2019ll keep you from the edge of the\ngulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you\nand myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage.\u201d\n \nFrom less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, after he\nhad retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and\nsaying, \u201cI wish you good-night, sir,\u201d in my natural and wonted respectful\nmanner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.\n \nThe system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and\nwith the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on\nthe whole I could see he was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like\nsubmission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more,\nwould have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited\nhis taste less.\n \nIn other people\u2019s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other\nline of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I\nthus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for me punctually the\nmoment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no\nsuch honeyed terms as \u201clove\u201d and \u201cdarling\u201d on his lips: the best words at my\nservice were \u201cprovoking puppet,\u201d \u201cmalicious elf,\u201d \u201csprite,\u201d \u201cchangeling,\u201d\n&c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a\npinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was\nall right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything\nmore tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account\nvanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed\nI was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my\npresent conduct at some period fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his\nmenaces. \u201cI can keep you in reasonable check now,\u201d I reflected; \u201cand I don\u2019t\ndoubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another\nmust be devised.\u201d\n \nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased\nthan teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more\nthan the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought\nof religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could\nnot, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.\n",
        "\nThe month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered.\nThere was no putting off the day that advanced\u2014the bridal day; and all\npreparations for its arrival were complete. I, at least, had nothing\nmore to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along\nthe wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on\ntheir road to London: and so should I (D.V.),\u2014or rather, not I, but one Jane\nRochester, a person whom as yet I knew not. The cards of address alone remained\nto nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had\nhimself written the direction, \u201cMrs. Rochester, \u2014\u2014 Hotel, London,\u201d on each: I\ncould not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs.\nRochester! She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time\nafter eight o\u2019clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had\ncome into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was\nenough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be\nhers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for\nnot to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe,\nthe vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau. I shut the closet to\nconceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening\nhour\u2014nine o\u2019clock\u2014gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow\nof my apartment. \u201cI will leave you by yourself, white dream,\u201d I said. \u201cI am\nfeverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.\u201d\n \nIt was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only the\nanticipation of the great change\u2014the new life which was to commence to-morrow:\nboth these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in producing that\nrestless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late hour into the\ndarkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind more than they.\n \nI had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened which I\ncould not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but myself: it had\ntaken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home;\nnor was he yet returned: business had called him to a small estate of two or\nthree farms he possessed thirty miles off\u2014business it was requisite he should\nsettle in person, previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited\nnow his return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of\nthe enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose\nmy secret to him, you shall share the confidence.\n \nI sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had\nblown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of\nrain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to augment its rush and\ndeepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and\nscarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the\nstrain bending their branchy heads northward\u2014the clouds drifted from pole to\npole, fast following, mass on mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible\nthat July day.\n \nIt was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my\ntrouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space.\nDescending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up\nblack and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven\nhalves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept\nthem unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed\u2014the sap could\nflow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter\u2019s\ntempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they\nmight be said to form one tree\u2014a ruin, but an entire ruin.\n \n\u201cYou did right to hold fast to each other,\u201d I said: as if the monster-splinters\nwere living things, and could hear me. \u201cI think, scathed as you look, and\ncharred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising\nout of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green\nleaves more\u2014never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs;\nthe time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each\nof you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.\u201d As I looked up at\nthem, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their\nfissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me\none bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep\ndrift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away\nover wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to,\nand I ran off again.\n \nHere and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which\nthe grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in\ndividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them\naway in the store-room. Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the\nfire was lit, for, though summer, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester\nwould like to see a cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been\nkindled some time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the\nchimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had\nthe candles brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had\ncompleted these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the\nhouse: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall\nsimultaneously struck ten.\n \n\u201cHow late it grows!\u201d I said. \u201cI will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at\nintervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be coming now, and to meet\nhim will save some minutes of suspense.\u201d\n \nThe wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road\nas far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and\nsolitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon\nlooked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.\n \nA puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked\u2014a tear of disappointment and\nimpatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon shut herself\nwholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night\ngrew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\n \n\u201cI wish he would come! I wish he would come!\u201d I exclaimed, seized with\nhypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it was\ndark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of last night\nagain recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of disaster. I feared my\nhopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately\nthat I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.\n \n\u201cWell, I cannot return to the house,\u201d I thought; \u201cI cannot sit by the fireside,\nwhile he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my\nheart; I will go forward and meet him.\u201d\n \nI set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile,\nI heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by his\nside. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he was, mounted on Mesrour,\nfollowed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky,\nand rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head.\nI now ran to meet him.\n \n\u201cThere!\u201d he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the saddle:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe; give me both\nhands: mount!\u201d\n \nI obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I got for\na welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well as I could. He\nchecked himself in his exultation to demand, \u201cBut is there anything the matter,\nJanet, that you come to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in the house\nfor you, especially with this rain and wind.\u201d\n \n\u201cRain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak\nround you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and hand are\nburning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you have been both?\u201d\n \n\u201cRather: but I\u2019ll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I daresay you will\nonly laugh at me for my pains.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my\nprize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this\nlast month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere\nbut I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms.\nYou wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cI wanted you: but don\u2019t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me get\ndown.\u201d\n \nHe landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed me into\nthe hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to\nhim in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a\npromise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined\nhim. I found him at supper.\n \n\u201cTake a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal but one\nyou will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.\u201d\n \nI sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.\n \n\u201cIs it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is it the\nthoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?\u201d\n \n\u201cI cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what\nthoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.\u201d\n \n\u201cExcept me: I am substantial enough\u2014touch me.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.\u201d\n \nHe held out his hand, laughing. \u201cIs that a dream?\u201d said he, placing it close to\nmy eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long,\nstrong arm.\n \n\u201cYes; though I touch it, it is a dream,\u201d said I, as I put it down from before\nmy face. \u201cSir, have you finished supper?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Jane.\u201d\n \nI rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I stirred\nthe fire, and then took a low seat at my master\u2019s knee.\n \n\u201cIt is near midnight,\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cYes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my\nwedding.\u201d\n \n\u201cI did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish\nto go to bed.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre all your arrangements complete?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd on my part likewise,\u201d he returned, \u201cI have settled everything; and we\nshall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return from\nchurch.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWith what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word\u2014\u2018very well,\u2019 Jane! What\na bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes\nglitter! Are you well?\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe I am.\u201d\n \n\u201cBelieve! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.\u201d\n \n\u201cI could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this present\nhour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?\u201d\n \n\u201cThis is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or over-fatigued.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you, sir, feel calm and happy?\u201d\n \n\u201cCalm?\u2014no: but happy\u2014to the heart\u2019s core.\u201d\n \nI looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and\nflushed.\n \n\u201cGive me your confidence, Jane,\u201d he said: \u201crelieve your mind of any weight that\noppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?\u2014that I shall not prove a\ngood husband?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is the idea farthest from my thoughts.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?\u2014of the new life\ninto which you are passing?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain\nme. I want an explanation.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, sir, listen. You were from home last night?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened\nin my absence:\u2014nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has\ndisturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you\nhave overheard the servants talk?\u2014your sensitive self-respect has been\nwounded?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d It struck twelve\u2014I waited till the time-piece had concluded its\nsilver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I proceeded.\n \n\u201cAll day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless bustle; for\nI am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new\nsphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with\nyou, because I love you. No, sir, don\u2019t caress me now\u2014let me talk undisturbed.\nYesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working\ntogether for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect\u2014the\ncalmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or\ncomfort on your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,\nthinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed\nyour actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me\u2014your\nlife, sir\u2014an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so\nas the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its\nown strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary\nwilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned\ncold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my\nwedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found\nyour present\u2014the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from\nLondon: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into\naccepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I\nwould tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your\nplebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down\nto you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering\nfor my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could\nbring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how\nyou would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty\ndisavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your\nstanding, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow well you read me, you witch!\u201d interposed Mr. Rochester: \u201cbut what did you\nfind in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison, or a dagger, that\nyou look so mournful now?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing\nsave Fairfax Rochester\u2019s pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to\nthe sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew\nyesterday evening, not as it blows now\u2014wild and high\u2014but \u2018with a sullen,\nmoaning sound\u2019 far more eerie. I wished you were at home. I came into this\nroom, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me. For some\ntime after I went to bed, I could not sleep\u2014a sense of anxious excitement\ndistressed me. The gale still rising seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful\nunder-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it\nrecurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be\nsome dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On sleeping, I\ncontinued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the\nwish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some\nbarrier dividing us. During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of\nan unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened\nwith the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble\nto walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I\nthought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained\nevery nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and\nentreat you to stop\u2014but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died\naway inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every\nmoment.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to you?\nLittle nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness!\nYou say you love me, Janet: yes\u2014I will not forget that; and you cannot deny it.\nThose words did not die inarticulate on your lips. I heard them clear\nand soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music\u2014\u2018I think it is a\nglorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because I love\nyou.\u2019 Do you love me, Jane?\u2014repeat it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do, sir\u2014I do, with my whole heart.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, after some minutes\u2019 silence, \u201cit is strange; but that sentence\nhas penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you said it with such\nan earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the\nvery sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit\nwere near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your\nwild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me\u2014tease me, vex me; do anything\nbut move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will tease you and vex you to your heart\u2019s content, when I have finished my\ntale: but hear me to the end.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your\nmelancholy in a dream.\u201d\n \nI shook my head. \u201cWhat! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything\nimportant. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.\u201d\n \nThe disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his manner,\nsurprised me: but I proceeded.\n \n\u201cI dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the\nretreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing\nremained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking. I wandered,\non a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled\nover a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up\nin a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down\nanywhere, however tired were my arms\u2014however much its weight impeded my\nprogress, I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\nroad; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a\ndistant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to\ncatch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet,\nthe ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror,\nand almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on\na white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not\nstand. I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap:\nyou turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall\ncrumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell,\nand woke.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, Jane, that is all.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my\neyes; I thought\u2014Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it was only\ncandlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a light in the\ndressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had\nhung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there. I asked,\n\u2018Sophie, what are you doing?\u2019 No one answered; but a form emerged from the\ncloset; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent\nfrom the portmanteau. \u2018Sophie! Sophie!\u2019 I again cried: and still it was silent.\nI had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came\nover me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this was\nnot Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not\u2014no, I was sure\nof it, and am still\u2014it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt must have been one of them,\u201d interrupted my master.\n \n\u201cNo, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing before me\nhad never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the\nheight, the contour were new to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cDescribe it, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long\ndown her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but\nwhether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you see her face?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up,\ngazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the\nmirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite\ndistinctly in the dark oblong glass.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd how were they?\u201d\n \n\u201cFearful and ghastly to me\u2014oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a\ndiscoloured face\u2014it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the\nred eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!\u201d\n \n\u201cGhosts are usually pale, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the\nblack eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what\nit reminded me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf the foul German spectre\u2014the Vampyre.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh!\u2014what did it do?\u201d\n \n\u201cSir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and\nflinging both on the floor, trampled on them.\u201d\n \n\u201cAfterwards?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn\napproaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at my\nbedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me\u2014she thrust up her\ncandle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes. I was aware her\nlurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in\nmy life\u2014only the second time\u2014I became insensible from terror.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho was with you when you revived?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in water,\ndrank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined\nthat to none but you would I impart this vision. Now, sir, tell me who and what\nthat woman was?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be careful\nof you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling.\u201d\n \n\u201cSir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the\ntransaction actually took place.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a ruin? Am I\nsevered from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you without a\ntear\u2014without a kiss\u2014without a word?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cAm I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us\nindissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of\nthese mental terrors: I guarantee that.\u201d\n \n\u201cMental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I wish it\nmore now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the mystery of that\nawful visitant.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I looked\nround the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each\nfamiliar object in full daylight, there\u2014on the carpet\u2014I saw what gave the\ndistinct lie to my hypothesis,\u2014the veil, torn from top to bottom in two\nhalves!\u201d\n \nI felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round me.\n\u201cThank God!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat if anything malignant did come near you last\nnight, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think what might have\nhappened!\u201d\n \nHe drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could scarcely\npant. After some minutes\u2019 silence, he continued, cheerily\u2014\n \n\u201cNow, Janet, I\u2019ll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half reality.\nA woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was\u2014must have\nbeen\u2014Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you\nhave reason so to call her\u2014what did she do to me? what to Mason? In a state\nbetween sleeping and waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but\nfeverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance\ndifferent from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the\nexaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the\nspiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you would ask\nwhy I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a\nday, I will tell you; but not now. Are you satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my\nsolution of the mystery?\u201d\n \nI reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I\nwas not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so\u2014relieved, I certainly did\nfeel; so I answered him with a contented smile. And now, as it was long past\none, I prepared to leave him.\n \n\u201cDoes not Sophie sleep with Ad\u00e8le in the nursery?\u201d he asked, as I lit my\ncandle.\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd there is room enough in Ad\u00e8le\u2019s little bed for you. You must share it with\nher to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have related should\nmake you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go\nto the nursery.\u201d\n \n\u201cI shall be very glad to do so, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go upstairs,\nunder pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-morrow; for you\nmust be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight. And now, no more\nsombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet. Don\u2019t you hear to what soft\nwhispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the\nwindow-panes: look here\u201d (he lifted up the curtain)\u2014\u201cit is a lovely night!\u201d\n \nIt was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping before the\nwind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward in long, silvered\ncolumns. The moon shone peacefully.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, \u201chow is my Janet\nnow?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe night is serene, sir; and so am I.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love\nand blissful union.\u201d\n \nThis prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow, but\nas little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all. With little Ad\u00e8le in my\narms, I watched the slumber of childhood\u2014so tranquil, so passionless, so\ninnocent\u2014and waited for the coming day: all my life was awake and astir in my\nframe: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too. I remember Ad\u00e8le clung to me as\nI left her: I remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my\nneck; and I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I\nfeared my sobs would break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my\npast life; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored,\ntype of my unknown future day.\n",
        "\nSophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in accomplishing her\ntask; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, impatient of my delay, sent\nup to ask why I did not come. She was just fastening my veil (the plain square\nof blond after all) to my hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as\nsoon as I could.\n \n\u201cStop!\u201d she cried in French. \u201cLook at yourself in the mirror: you have not\ntaken one peep.\u201d\n \nSo I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual\nself that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. \u201cJane!\u201d called a voice, and\nI hastened down. I was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester.\n \n\u201cLingerer!\u201d he said, \u201cmy brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry so\nlong!\u201d\n \nHe took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced me\n\u201cfair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his\neyes,\u201d and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat some\nbreakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately hired servants, a footman,\nanswered it.\n \n\u201cIs John getting the carriage ready?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs the luggage brought down?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are bringing it down, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cGo you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there:\nreturn and tell me.\u201d\n \nThe church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the footman\nsoon returned.\n \n\u201cMr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the carriage?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe horses are harnessing.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we\nreturn: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in\nhis seat.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, are you ready?\u201d\n \nI rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or\nmarshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we\npassed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was held by a grasp of\niron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr.\nRochester\u2019s face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for\nany purpose. I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did\u2014so bent up to\na purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever\nrevealed such flaming and flashing eyes.\n \nI know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed\nneither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated\ninto Mr. Rochester\u2019s frame. I wanted to see the invisible thing on which, as we\nwent along, he appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel\nthe thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting.\n \nAt the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of breath.\n\u201cAm I cruel in my love?\u201d he said. \u201cDelay an instant: lean on me, Jane.\u201d\n \nAnd now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm\nbefore me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond.\nI remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten,\neither, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading\nthe mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as\nthey saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not\nthey were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony. By\nMr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face, from\nwhich the blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy,\nand my cheeks and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently\nwith me up the path to the porch.\n \nWe entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white surplice\nat the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two shadows only moved\nin a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct: the strangers had slipped\nin before us, and they now stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs\ntowards us, viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a\nkneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor\nin the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.\n \nOur place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step behind me,\nI glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers\u2014a gentleman, evidently\u2014was\nadvancing up the chancel. The service began. The explanation of the intent of\nmatrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward,\nand, bending slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.\n \n\u201cI require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of\njudgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if either of\nyou know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in\nmatrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that so many as are\ncoupled together otherwise than God\u2019s Word doth allow, are not joined together\nby God, neither is their matrimony lawful.\u201d\n \nHe paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken\nby reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the clergyman, who had not\nlifted his eyes from his book, and had held his breath but for a moment, was\nproceeding: his hand was already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips\nunclosed to ask, \u201cWilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?\u201d\u2014when a\ndistinct and near voice said\u2014\n \n\u201cThe marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.\u201d\n \nThe clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same;\nMr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet:\ntaking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he said, \u201cProceed.\u201d\n \nProfound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low\nintonation. Presently Mr. Wood said\u2014\n \n\u201cI cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and\nevidence of its truth or falsehood.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe ceremony is quite broken off,\u201d subjoined the voice behind us. \u201cI am in a\ncondition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage\nexists.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making no\nmovement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and strong grasp he had!\nand how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive front at this moment!\nHow his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild beneath!\n \nMr. Wood seemed at a loss. \u201cWhat is the nature of the impediment?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cPerhaps it may be got over\u2014explained away?\u201d\n \n\u201cHardly,\u201d was the answer. \u201cI have called it insuperable, and I speak\nadvisedly.\u201d\n \nThe speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued, uttering each\nword distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly\u2014\n \n\u201cIt simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr. Rochester has\na wife now living.\u201d\n \nMy nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to\nthunder\u2014my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire;\nbut I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I\nmade him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark\nand flint. He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.\nWithout speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human\nbeing, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\n \n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked of the intruder.\n \n\u201cMy name is Briggs, a solicitor of \u2014\u2014 Street, London.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you would thrust on me a wife?\u201d\n \n\u201cI would remind you of your lady\u2019s existence, sir, which the law recognises, if\nyou do not.\u201d\n \n\u201cFavour me with an account of her\u2014with her name, her parentage, her place of\nabode.\u201d\n \n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read out in a\nsort of official, nasal voice:\u2014\n \n\u201c\u2018I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. \u2014\u2014 (a date of fifteen\nyears back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of \u2014\u2014,\nand of Ferndean Manor, in \u2014\u2014shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha\nAntoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his\nwife, a Creole, at \u2014\u2014 church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage\nwill be found in the register of that church\u2014a copy of it is now in my\npossession. Signed, Richard Mason.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2014if a genuine document\u2014may prove I have been married, but it does not\nprove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe was living three months ago,\u201d returned the lawyer.\n \n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely\ncontrovert.\u201d\n \n\u201cProduce him\u2014or go to hell.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will produce him first\u2014he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the goodness to\nstep forward.\u201d\n \nMr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a sort\nof strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the spasmodic\nmovement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second stranger, who had\nhitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the\nsolicitor\u2019s shoulder\u2014yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared\nat him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny,\nnay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face flushed\u2014olive cheek and hueless\nforehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he\nstirred, lifted his strong arm\u2014he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the\nchurch-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body\u2014but Mason\nshrank away, and cried faintly, \u201cGood God!\u201d Contempt fell cool on Mr.\nRochester\u2014his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he only\nasked\u2014\u201cWhat have you to say?\u201d\n \nAn inaudible reply escaped Mason\u2019s white lips.\n \n\u201cThe devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand, what have\nyou to say?\u201d\n \n\u201cSir\u2014sir,\u201d interrupted the clergyman, \u201cdo not forget you are in a sacred\nplace.\u201d Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, \u201cAre you aware, sir, whether\nor not this gentleman\u2019s wife is still living?\u201d\n \n\u201cCourage,\u201d urged the lawyer,\u2014\u201cspeak out.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is now living at Thornfield Hall,\u201d said Mason, in more articulate tones:\n\u201cI saw her there last April. I am her brother.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt Thornfield Hall!\u201d ejaculated the clergyman. \u201cImpossible! I am an old\nresident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at\nThornfield Hall.\u201d\n \nI saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester\u2019s lips, and he muttered\u2014\n \n\u201cNo, by God! I took care that none should hear of it\u2014or of her under that\nname.\u201d He mused\u2014for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he formed his\nresolve, and announced it\u2014\n \n\u201cEnough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel. Wood,\nclose your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave\nthe church: there will be no wedding to-day.\u201d The man obeyed.\n \nMr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: \u201cBigamy is an ugly word!\u2014I\nmeant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence\nhas checked me,\u2014perhaps the last. I am little better than a devil at this\nmoment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest\njudgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my\nplan is broken up:\u2014what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been\nmarried, and the woman to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of\na Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a\ntime inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under\nwatch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:\nsome, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I\nmarried fifteen years ago,\u2014Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute\npersonage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you\nwhat a stout heart men may bear. Cheer up, Dick!\u2014never fear me!\u2014I\u2019d almost as\nsoon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family;\nidiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both\na madwoman and a drunkard!\u2014as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for\nthey were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied\nher parent in both points. I had a charming partner\u2014pure, wise, modest: you can\nfancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been\nheavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation. Briggs,\nWood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole\u2019s\npatient, and my wife! You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated\ninto espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact,\nand seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl,\u201d he continued,\nlooking at me, \u201cknew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she\nthought all was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped\ninto a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and\nembruted partner! Come all of you\u2014follow!\u201d\n \nStill holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came after. At\nthe front door of the hall we found the carriage.\n \n\u201cTake it back to the coach-house, John,\u201d said Mr. Rochester coolly; \u201cit will\nnot be wanted to-day.\u201d\n \nAt our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Ad\u00e8le, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet\nus.\n \n\u201cTo the right-about\u2014every soul!\u201d cried the master; \u201caway with your\ncongratulations! Who wants them? Not I!\u2014they are fifteen years too late!\u201d\n \nHe passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\nbeckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the first\nstaircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black\ndoor, opened by Mr. Rochester\u2019s master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room,\nwith its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\n \n\u201cYou know this place, Mason,\u201d said our guide; \u201cshe bit and stabbed you here.\u201d\n \nHe lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he\nopened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and\nstrong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole\nbent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the deep\nshade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards.\nWhat it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell:\nit grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some\nstrange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark,\ngrizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.\n \n\u201cGood-morrow, Mrs. Poole!\u201d said Mr. Rochester. \u201cHow are you? and how is your\ncharge to-day?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re tolerable, sir, I thank you,\u201d replied Grace, lifting the boiling mess\ncarefully on to the hob: \u201crather snappish, but not \u2019rageous.\u201d\n \nA fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed hyena\nrose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\n \n\u201cAh! sir, she sees you!\u201d exclaimed Grace: \u201cyou\u2019d better not stay.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.\u201d\n \n\u201cTake care then, sir!\u2014for God\u2019s sake, take care!\u201d\n \nThe maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and gazed\nwildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,\u2014those bloated\nfeatures. Mrs. Poole advanced.\n \n\u201cKeep out of the way,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: \u201cshe has no\nknife now, I suppose, and I\u2019m on my guard.\u201d\n \n\u201cOne never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal\ndiscretion to fathom her craft.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe had better leave her,\u201d whispered Mason.\n \n\u201cGo to the devil!\u201d was his brother-in-law\u2019s recommendation.\n \n\u201c\u2019Ware!\u201d cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.\nRochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat\nviciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She was a big\nwoman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent besides: she\nshowed virile force in the contest\u2014more than once she almost throttled him,\nathletic as he was. He could have settled her with a well-planted blow; but he\nwould not strike: he would only wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace\nPoole gave him a cord, and he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which\nwas at hand, he bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the\nfiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to\nthe spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\n \n\u201cThat is my wife,\u201d said he. \u201cSuch is the sole conjugal embrace I am ever\nto know\u2014such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure hours! And\nthis is what I wished to have\u201d (laying his hand on my shoulder): \u201cthis\nyoung girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking\ncollectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just as a change after that\nfierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Compare these clear\neyes with the red balls yonder\u2014this face with that mask\u2014this form with that\nbulk; then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with\nwhat judgment ye judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my\nprize.\u201d\n \nWe all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some further\norder to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he descended the stair.\n \n\u201cYou, madam,\u201d said he, \u201care cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to\nhear it\u2014if, indeed, he should be still living\u2014when Mr. Mason returns to\nMadeira.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy uncle! What of him? Do you know him?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his house for\nsome years. When your uncle received your letter intimating the contemplated\nunion between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira\nto recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr.\nEyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted\nwith a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed\nas you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry\nto say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\ndisease\u2014decline\u2014and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise.\nHe could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare\ninto which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking\nsteps to prevent the false marriage. He referred him to me for assistance. I\nused all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must\nbe also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach\nMadeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think\nyou had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of\nMr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?\u201d he inquired of Mr. Mason.\n \n\u201cNo, no\u2014let us be gone,\u201d was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take\nleave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The clergyman\nstayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his\nhaughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\n \nI heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which I had\nnow withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none\nmight intrude, and proceeded\u2014not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for\nthat, but\u2014mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the\nstuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat\ndown: I felt weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped\non them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved\u2014followed up\nand down where I was led or dragged\u2014watched event rush on event, disclosure\nopen beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.\n \nThe morning had been a quiet morning enough\u2014all except the brief scene with the\nlunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there was no\nexplosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance or\nchallenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced\nobjection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr.\nRochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of\nthe truth had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen;\nthe intruders were gone, and all was over.\n \nI was in my own room as usual\u2014just myself, without obvious change: nothing had\nsmitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was the Jane Eyre of\nyesterday?\u2014where was her life?\u2014where were her prospects?\n \nJane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman\u2014almost a bride, was a cold,\nsolitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A\nChristmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over\nJune; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield\nand cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of\nflowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve\nhours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread,\nwaste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all\ndead\u2014struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the\nfirst-born in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\nblooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never\nrevive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master\u2019s\u2014which he had\ncreated; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle;\nsickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester\u2019s arms\u2014it\ncould not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him;\nfor faith was blighted\u2014confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what\nhe had been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to\nhim; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth\nwas gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I\nperceived well. When\u2014how\u2014whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I\ndoubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he\ncould not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he\nwould want me no more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must\nbe hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!\n \nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and\nreflection came in as black and confused a flow. Self-abandoned, relaxed, and\neffortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river;\nI heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to\nrise I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead.\nOne idea only still throbbed life-like within me\u2014a remembrance of God: it begot\nan unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind,\nas something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them\u2014\n \n\u201cBe not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.\u201d\n \nIt was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it\u2014as I had\nneither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips\u2014it came: in full\nheavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life\nlorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and\nmighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in\ntruth, \u201cthe waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing;\nI came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.\u201d\n",
        "\nSome time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing the\nwestern sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked, \u201cWhat am I to\ndo?\u201d\n \nBut the answer my mind gave\u2014\u201cLeave Thornfield at once\u201d\u2014was so prompt, so dread,\nthat I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words now. \u201cThat I am not\nEdward Rochester\u2019s bride is the least part of my woe,\u201d I alleged: \u201cthat I have\nwakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a\nhorror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly,\nentirely, is intolerable. I cannot do it.\u201d\n \nBut, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I\nshould do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I\nmight avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and\nConscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she\nhad yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm\nof iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony.\n \n\u201cLet me be torn away, then\u201d I cried. \u201cLet another help me!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself\npluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be\nthe victim, and you the priest to transfix it.\u201d\n \nI rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge\nhaunted,\u2014at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood\nerect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither\nmeat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast. And,\nwith a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no\nmessage had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even\nlittle Ad\u00e8le had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.\n\u201cFriends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,\u201d I murmured, as I undrew\nthe bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy,\nmy sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself. I\nfell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up\u2014I\nwas supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.\n \n\u201cYou come out at last,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I have been waiting for you long, and\nlistening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of\nthat death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar. So you\nshun me?\u2014you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and\nupbraided me with vehemence. You are passionate: I expected a scene of some\nkind. I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed\non my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched\nhandkerchief. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a\nfaded eye, but no trace of tears. I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping\nblood?\n \n\u201cWell, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter\u2014nothing poignant? Nothing\nto cut a feeling or sting a passion? You sit quietly where I have placed you,\nand regard me with a weary, passive look.\n \n\u201cJane, I never meant to wound you thus. If the man who had but one little ewe\nlamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his\ncup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles,\nhe would not have rued his bloody blunder more than I now rue mine. Will you\never forgive me?\u201d\n \nReader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot. There was such deep\nremorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his\nmanner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and mien\u2014I\nforgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my heart\u2019s core.\n \n\u201cYou know I am a scoundrel, Jane?\u201d ere long he inquired wistfully\u2014wondering, I\nsuppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness\nthan of will.\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen tell me so roundly and sharply\u2014don\u2019t spare me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water.\u201d He heaved a sort of\nshuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs. At first I\ndid not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my glazed sight:\npresently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had\nbecome icy cold in my chamber. He put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived;\nthen I ate something he offered me, and was soon myself. I was in the\nlibrary\u2014sitting in his chair\u2014he was quite near. \u201cIf I could go out of life now,\nwithout too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,\u201d I thought; \u201cthen I should\nnot have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from\namong Mr. Rochester\u2019s. I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave\nhim\u2014I cannot leave him.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow are you now, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cMuch better, sir; I shall be well soon.\u201d\n \n\u201cTaste the wine again, Jane.\u201d\n \nI obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and looked\nat me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation,\nfull of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and\ncame back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses\nwere now forbidden. I turned my face away and put his aside.\n \n\u201cWhat!\u2014How is this?\u201d he exclaimed hastily. \u201cOh, I know! you won\u2019t kiss the\nhusband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my embraces\nappropriated?\u201d\n \n\u201cAt any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, Jane? I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for\nyou\u2014Because I have a wife already, you would reply.\u2014I guess rightly?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard me as\na plotting profligate\u2014a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested\nlove in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of\nhonour and rob you of self-respect. What do you say to that? I see you can say\nnothing: in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw\nyour breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse\nand revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would\nrush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid,\nto make a scene: you are thinking how to act\u2014talking you consider\nis of no use. I know you\u2014I am on my guard.\u201d\n \n\u201cSir, I do not wish to act against you,\u201d I said; and my unsteady voice warned\nme to curtail my sentence.\n \n\u201cNot in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to\ndestroy me. You have as good as said that I am a married man\u2014as a married man\nyou will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me. You\nintend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only\nas Ad\u00e8le\u2019s governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly\nfeeling inclines you again to me, you will say,\u2014\u2018That man had nearly made me\nhis mistress: I must be ice and rock to him;\u2019 and ice and rock you will\naccordingly become.\u201d\n \nI cleared and steadied my voice to reply: \u201cAll is changed about me, sir; I must\nchange too\u2014there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and\ncontinual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one\nway\u2014Ad\u00e8le must have a new governess, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, Ad\u00e8le will go to school\u2014I have settled that already; nor do I mean to\ntorment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield\nHall\u2014this accursed place\u2014this tent of Achan\u2014this insolent vault, offering the\nghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky\u2014this narrow stone\nhell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine. Jane,\nyou shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to\nThornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted. I charged them to conceal\nfrom you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place;\nmerely because I feared Ad\u00e8le never would have a governess to stay if she knew\nwith what inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the\nmaniac elsewhere\u2014though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more\nretired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely enough, had\nnot a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood,\nmade my conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would\nsoon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own vice; and mine is\nnot a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.\n \n\u201cConcealing the mad-woman\u2019s neighbourhood from you, however, was something like\ncovering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon\u2019s\nvicinage is poisoned, and always was. But I\u2019ll shut up Thornfield Hall: I\u2019ll\nnail up the front door and board the lower windows: I\u2019ll give Mrs. Poole two\nhundred a year to live here with my wife, as you term that fearful hag:\nGrace will do much for money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby\nRetreat, to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms,\nwhen my wife is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at\nnight, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cSir,\u201d I interrupted him, \u201cyou are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you\nspeak of her with hate\u2014with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel\u2014she cannot help\nbeing mad.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don\u2019t know\nwhat you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad\nI hate her. If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do indeed, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the\nsort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me\nas my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear. Your mind is my\ntreasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved,\nmy arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat\u2014your grasp, even in\nfury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did\nthis morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would\nbe restrictive. I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in\nyour quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could\nhang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return;\nand never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of\nrecognition for me.\u2014But why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of\nremoving you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure:\nto-morrow you shall go. I only ask you to endure one more night under this\nroof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever! I have a\nplace to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful\nreminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion\u2014even from falsehood and slander.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd take Ad\u00e8le with you, sir,\u201d I interrupted; \u201cshe will be a companion for\nyou.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean, Jane? I told you I would send Ad\u00e8le to school; and what do I\nwant with a child for a companion, and not my own child,\u2014a French dancer\u2019s\nbastard? Why do you importune me about her! I say, why do you assign Ad\u00e8le to\nme for a companion?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull\nfor you.\u201d\n \n\u201cSolitude! solitude!\u201d he reiterated with irritation. \u201cI see I must come to an\nexplanation. I don\u2019t know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your\ncountenance. You are to share my solitude. Do you understand?\u201d\n \nI shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was becoming,\neven to risk that mute sign of dissent. He had been walking fast about the\nroom, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot. He looked at me long\nand hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire, and tried to\nassume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.\n \n\u201cNow for the hitch in Jane\u2019s character,\u201d he said at last, speaking more calmly\nthan from his look I had expected him to speak. \u201cThe reel of silk has run\nsmoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle:\nhere it is. Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I\nlong to exert a fraction of Samson\u2019s strength, and break the entanglement like\ntow!\u201d\n \nHe recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before me.\n \n\u201cJane! will you hear reason?\u201d (he stooped and approached his lips to my ear);\n\u201cbecause, if you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll try violence.\u201d His voice was hoarse; his look that\nof a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong\ninto wild license. I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy\nmore, I should be able to do nothing with him. The present\u2014the passing second\nof time\u2014was all I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement of\nrepulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,\u2014and his. But I was not\nafraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which\nsupported me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the\nIndian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I took hold\nof his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,\nsoothingly\u2014\n \n\u201cSit down; I\u2019ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say,\nwhether reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d\n \nHe sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly. I had been struggling\nwith tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I\nknew he would not like to see me weep. Now, however, I considered it well to\nlet them flow as freely and as long as they liked. If the flood annoyed him, so\nmuch the better. So I gave way and cried heartily.\n \nSoon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could not\nwhile he was in such a passion.\n \n\u201cBut I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your\nlittle pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it.\nHush, now, and wipe your eyes.\u201d\n \nHis softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn, became\ncalm. Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but I would not\npermit it. Then he would draw me to him: no.\n \n\u201cJane! Jane!\u201d he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along\nevery nerve I had; \u201cyou don\u2019t love me, then? It was only my station, and the\nrank of my wife, that you valued? Now that you think me disqualified to become\nyour husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape.\u201d\n \nThese words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to have done\nor said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting\nhis feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded.\n \n\u201cI do love you,\u201d I said, \u201cmore than ever: but I must not show or indulge\nthe feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see me\ndaily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but one\nway: but you will be furious if I mention it.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I must leave you.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair\u2014which is\nsomewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face\u2014which looks feverish?\u201d\n \n\u201cI must leave Ad\u00e8le and Thornfield. I must part with you for my whole life: I\nmust begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about parting from\nme. You mean you must become a part of me. As to the new existence, it is all\nright: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs.\nRochester\u2014both virtually and nominally. I shall keep only to you so long as you\nand I live. You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a\nwhitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean. There you shall live a\nhappy, and guarded, and most innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you\ninto error\u2014to make you my mistress. Why did you shake your head? Jane, you must\nbe reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.\u201d\n \nHis voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed: still\nI dared to speak.\n \n\u201cSir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by\nyourself. If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mistress: to\nsay otherwise is sophistical\u2014is false.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, I am not a gentle-tempered man\u2014you forget that: I am not long-enduring;\nI am not cool and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself, put your\nfinger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and\u2014beware!\u201d\n \nHe bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and\nlips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands. To agitate him\nthus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the\nquestion. I did what human beings do instinctively when they are driven to\nutter extremity\u2014looked for aid to one higher than man: the words \u201cGod help me!\u201d\nburst involuntarily from my lips.\n \n\u201cI am a fool!\u201d cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. \u201cI keep telling her I am not\nmarried, and do not explain to her why. I forget she knows nothing of the\ncharacter of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union\nwith her. Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she knows\nall that I know! Just put your hand in mine, Janet\u2014that I may have the evidence\nof touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me\u2014and I will in a few words\nshow you the real state of the case. Can you listen to me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir; for hours if you will.\u201d\n \n\u201cI ask only minutes. Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest\nson of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?\u201d\n \n\u201cI remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have understood something to that effect.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he\ncould not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion:\nall, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he\nendure that a son of his should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a\nwealthy marriage. He sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India\nplanter and merchant, was his old acquaintance. He was certain his possessions\nwere real and vast: he made inquiries. Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and\ndaughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a\nfortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was\nsent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father said\nnothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish\nTown for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine woman, in the\nstyle of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her family wished to secure\nme because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in\nparties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw her alone, and had very little\nprivate conversation with her. She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my\npleasure her charms and accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to\nadmire her and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and\nbeing ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her. There is no\nfolly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the\nrashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission. Her\nrelatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was\nachieved almost before I knew where I was. Oh, I have no respect for myself\nwhen I think of that act!\u2014an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never\nloved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her. I was not sure of the\nexistence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor\nbenevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners\u2014and, I married\nher:\u2014gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was! With less sin I might\nhave\u2014But let me remember to whom I am speaking.\n \n\u201cMy bride\u2019s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead. The honeymoon\nover, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.\nThere was a younger brother, too\u2014a complete dumb idiot. The elder one, whom you\nhave seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he\nhas some grains of affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued\ninterest he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he\nonce bore me), will probably be in the same state one day. My father and my\nbrother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand\npounds, and joined in the plot against me.\n \n\u201cThese were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I\nshould have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her\nnature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind\ncommon, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher,\nexpanded to anything larger\u2014when I found that I could not pass a single\nevening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly\nconversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I\nstarted, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite,\nperverse and imbecile\u2014when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or\nsettled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her\nviolent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,\nexacting orders\u2014even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I\ncurtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret;\nI repressed the deep antipathy I felt.\n \n\u201cJane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall\nexpress what I have to say. I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and\nbefore that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed\nwith frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so\nstrong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty. What a\npigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the\ncurses those propensities entailed on me! Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an\ninfamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which\nmust attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.\n \n\u201cMy brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my\nfather died too. I was rich enough now\u2014yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature\nthe most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and\ncalled by the law and by society a part of me. And I could not rid myself of it\nby any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife\nwas mad\u2014her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity. Jane, you\ndon\u2019t like my narrative; you look almost sick\u2014shall I defer the rest to another\nday?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir, finish it now; I pity you\u2014I do earnestly pity you.\u201d\n \n\u201cPity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which\none is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that\nis the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid,\negotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those\nwho have endured them. But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling\nof which your whole face is full at this moment\u2014with which your eyes are now\nalmost overflowing\u2014with which your heart is heaving\u2014with which your hand is\ntrembling in mine. Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its\nanguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion. I accept it, Jane; let\nthe daughter have free advent\u2014my arms wait to receive her.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all\nthat intervened between me and the gulf. In the eyes of the world, I was\ndoubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own\nsight\u2014and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and\nwrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. Still, society\nassociated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily:\nsomething of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I\nremembered I had once been her husband\u2014that recollection was then, and is now,\ninexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never\nbe the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior\n(her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her age),\nshe was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm\nin mind. Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.\n \n\u201cOne night I had been awakened by her yells\u2014(since the medical men had\npronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)\u2014it was a fiery West\nIndian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of\nthose climates. Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window.\nThe air was like sulphur-steams\u2014I could find no refreshment anywhere.\nMosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I\ncould hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake\u2014black clouds were\ncasting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a\nhot cannon-ball\u2014she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with\nthe ferment of tempest. I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and\nscene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;\nwherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with\nsuch language!\u2014no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:\nthough two rooms off, I heard every word\u2014the thin partitions of the West India\nhouse opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.\n \n\u201c\u2018This life,\u2019 said I at last, \u2018is hell: this is the air\u2014those are the sounds of\nthe bottomless pit! I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. The\nsufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now\ncumbers my soul. Of the fanatic\u2019s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not\na future state worse than this present one\u2014let me break away, and go home to\nGod!\u2019\n \n\u201cI said this whilst I knelt down at and unlocked a trunk which contained a\nbrace of loaded pistols: I meant to shoot myself. I only entertained the\nintention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and\nunalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of\nself-destruction, was past in a second.\n \n\u201cA wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open\ncasement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure.\nI then framed and fixed a resolution. While I walked under the dripping\norange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and\npine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me\u2014I\nreasoned thus, Jane\u2014and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in\nthat hour, and showed me the right path to follow.\n \n\u201cThe sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and\nthe Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and\nscorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood\u2014my\nbeing longed for renewal\u2014my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope\nrevive\u2014and felt regeneration possible. From a flowery arch at the bottom of my\ngarden I gazed over the sea\u2014bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear\nprospects opened thus:\u2014\n \n\u201c\u2018Go,\u2019 said Hope, \u2018and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a\nsullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you. You may take\nthe maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions\nat Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new\ntie you like. That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied\nyour name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife,\nnor are you her husband. See that she is cared for as her condition demands,\nand you have done all that God and humanity require of you. Let her identity,\nher connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart\nthem to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her\ndegradation with secrecy, and leave her.\u2019\n \n\u201cI acted precisely on this suggestion. My father and brother had not made my\nmarriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote\nto apprise them of the union\u2014having already begun to experience extreme disgust\nof its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a\nhideous future opening to me\u2014I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and\nvery soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was\nsuch as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law. Far from desiring\nto publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.\n \n\u201cTo England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster\nin the vessel. Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield, and saw her\nsafely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she has\nnow for ten years made a wild beast\u2019s den\u2014a goblin\u2019s cell. I had some trouble\nin finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose\nfidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my\nsecret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days\u2014sometimes weeks\u2014which she\nfilled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy\nRetreat. She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason\u2019s wounds that night he\nwas stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my\nconfidence. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could\nhave gained no precise knowledge as to facts. Grace has, on the whole, proved a\ngood keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears\nnothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession, her\nvigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled. The lunatic is both\ncunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her guardian\u2019s\ntemporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother,\nand twice to possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the\nnight-time. On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to\nburn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you. I thank\nProvidence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding\napparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days:\nbut on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect. When I think of\nthe thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet\nvisage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what, sir,\u201d I asked, while he paused, \u201cdid you do when you had settled her\nhere? Where did you go?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Where did I\ngo? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit. I sought the\nContinent, and went devious through all its lands. My fixed desire was to seek\nand find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the\nfury I left at Thornfield\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you could not marry, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cI had determined and was convinced that I could and ought. It was not my\noriginal intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. I meant to tell my tale\nplainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely\nrational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted\nsome woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me,\nin spite of the curse with which I was burdened.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile. You open your eyes\nlike an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if\nanswers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the\ntablet of one\u2019s heart. But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your \u2018Well,\nsir?\u2019 It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has\ndrawn me on and on through interminable talk: I don\u2019t very well know why.\u201d\n \n\u201cI mean,\u2014What next? How did you proceed? What came of such an event?\u201d\n \n\u201cPrecisely! and what do you wish to know now?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you; and\nwhat she said.\u201d\n \n\u201cI can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her to\nmarry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate. For ten\nlong years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes\nin St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and\nFlorence. Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I\ncould choose my own society: no circles were closed against me. I sought my\nideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras,\nand German gr\u00e4finnen. I could not find her. Sometimes, for a fleeting\nmoment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which\nannounced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeceived. You are\nnot to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed\nonly for what suited me\u2014for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.\nAmongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I\u2014warned as I\nwas of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions\u2014would have\nasked to marry me. Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation\u2014never\ndebauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian Messalina\u2019s attribute:\nrooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure. Any\nenjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and\nI eschewed it.\n \n\u201cYet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses. The\nfirst I chose was C\u00e9line Varens\u2014another of those steps which make a man spurn\nhimself when he recalls them. You already know what she was, and how my liaison\nwith her terminated. She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a\nGerman, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me\nin a few weeks? Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three\nmonths. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not\none whit to my taste. I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in\na good line of business, and so get decently rid of her. But, Jane, I see by\nyour face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. You\nthink me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don\u2019t you?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. Did it not\nseem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and\nthen another? You talk of it as a mere matter of course.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of\nexistence: I should never like to return to it. Hiring a mistress is the next\nworse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by\nposition, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading. I now\nhate the recollection of the time I passed with C\u00e9line, Giacinta, and Clara.\u201d\n \nI felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain inference,\nthat if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that had ever been\ninstilled into me, as\u2014under any pretext\u2014with any justification\u2014through any\ntemptation\u2014to become the successor of these poor girls, he would one day regard\nme with the same feeling which now in his mind desecrated their memory. I did\nnot give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it. I impressed it\non my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of\ntrial.\n \n\u201cNow, Jane, why don\u2019t you say \u2018Well, sir?\u2019 I have not done. You are looking\ngrave. You disapprove of me still, I see. But let me come to the point. Last\nJanuary, rid of all mistresses\u2014in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of\na useless, roving, lonely life\u2014corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed\nagainst all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to\nregard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream),\nrecalled by business, I came back to England.\n \n\u201cOn a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred\nspot! I expected no peace\u2014no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a\nquiet little figure sitting by itself. I passed it as negligently as I did the\npollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me;\nno inward warning that the arbitress of my life\u2014my genius for good or\nevil\u2014waited there in humble guise. I did not know it, even when, on the\noccasion of Mesrour\u2019s accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.\nChildish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot\nand proposed to bear me on its tiny wing. I was surly; but the thing would not\ngo: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort\nof authority. I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.\n \n\u201cWhen once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new\u2014a fresh sap and\nsense\u2014stole into my frame. It was well I had learnt that this elf must return\nto me\u2014that it belonged to my house down below\u2014or I could not have felt it pass\naway from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without\nsingular regret. I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you\nwere not aware that I thought of you or watched for you. The next day I\nobserved you\u2014myself unseen\u2014for half-an-hour, while you played with Ad\u00e8le in the\ngallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I\nwas in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Ad\u00e8le claimed\nyour outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere:\nbut you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and\namused her a long time. When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep\nreverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery. Now and then, in\npassing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to\nthe sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day\nvisions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye\noccasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter,\nbilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of\nyouth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to\nan ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall,\nwakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet! There was\nmuch sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your\nown abstraction. It seemed to say\u2014\u2018My fine visions are all very well, but I\nmust not forget they are absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green\nflowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a\nrough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.\u2019 You\nran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house\naccounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I was vexed\nwith you for getting out of my sight.\n \n\u201cImpatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence. An\nunusual\u2014to me\u2014a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to\nsearch it deeper and know it better. You entered the room with a look and air\nat once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed\u2014much as you are now. I\nmade you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and\nmanner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether\nthat of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good\ndeal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or\nblunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to\nyour interlocutor\u2019s face: there was penetration and power in each glance you\ngave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very\nsoon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy\nbetween you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see\nhow quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I\nwould, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my\nmoroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet\nsagacious grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with\nwhat I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long\ntime, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an\nintellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this\nnovel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a\nhaunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade\u2014the\nsweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not then know that it was no\ntransitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an\nindestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I\nshunned you\u2014but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own\ndesk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as\nlittle token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual\nexpression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you\nwere not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual\npleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and\nresolved to find this out.\n \n\u201cI resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance, and\ngenial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was\nthe silent schoolroom\u2014it was the tedium of your life\u2014that made you mournful. I\npermitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion\nsoon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name\npronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance\nmeeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your\nmanner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble\u2014a hovering doubt: you did not\nknow what my caprice might be\u2014whether I was going to play the master and be\nstern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often to\nsimulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such\nbloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado\noften to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t talk any more of those days, sir,\u201d I interrupted, furtively dashing away\nsome tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for I knew what I must\ndo\u2014and do soon\u2014and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his\nfeelings only made my work more difficult.\n \n\u201cNo, Jane,\u201d he returned: \u201cwhat necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when\nthe Present is so much surer\u2014the Future so much brighter?\u201d\n \nI shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\n \n\u201cYou see now how the case stands\u2014do you not?\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter a youth and\nmanhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have\nfor the first time found what I can truly love\u2014I have found you. You are\nmy sympathy\u2014my better self\u2014my good angel. I am bound to you with a strong\nattachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is\nconceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of\nlife, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame,\nfuses you and me in one.\n \n\u201cIt was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To tell me\nthat I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a\nhideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a\nstubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early instilled prejudice:\nI wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences. This was cowardly: I\nshould have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do\nnow\u2014opened to you plainly my life of agony\u2014described to you my hunger and\nthirst after a higher and worthier existence\u2014shown to you, not my\nresolution (that word is weak), but my resistless bent to love\nfaithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return. Then I\nshould have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.\nJane\u2014give it me now.\u201d\n \nA pause.\n \n\u201cWhy are you silent, Jane?\u201d\n \nI was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals. Terrible\nmoment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human being that ever lived\ncould wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him who thus loved me I\nabsolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol. One drear word\ncomprised my intolerable duty\u2014\u201cDepart!\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, you understand what I want of you? Just this promise\u2014\u2018I will be yours,\nMr. Rochester.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I will not be yours.\u201d\n \nAnother long silence.\n \n\u201cJane!\u201d recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and\nturned me stone-cold with ominous terror\u2014for this still voice was the pant of a\nlion rising\u2014\u201cJane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go\nanother?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane\u201d (bending towards and embracing me), \u201cdo you mean it now?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd now?\u201d softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\n \n\u201cI do,\u201d extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.\n \n\u201cOh, Jane, this is bitter! This\u2014this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love\nme.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would to obey you.\u201d\n \nA wild look raised his brows\u2014crossed his features: he rose; but he forebore\nyet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared\u2014but I\nresolved.\n \n\u201cOne instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. All\nhappiness will be torn away with you. What then is left? For a wife I have but\nthe maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder\nchurchyard. What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some\nhope?\u201d\n \n\u201cDo as I do: trust in God and yourself. Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again\nthere.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you will not yield?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?\u201d His voice rose.\n \n\u201cI advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you snatch love and innocence from me? You fling me back on lust for a\npassion\u2014vice for an occupation?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for\nmyself. We were born to strive and endure\u2014you as well as I: do so. You will\nforget me before I forget you.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I could\nnot change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon. And what a distortion\nin your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct!\nIs it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere\nhuman law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives\nnor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?\u201d\n \nThis was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors\nagainst me, and charged me with crime in resisting him. They spoke almost as\nloud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly. \u201cOh, comply!\u201d it said. \u201cThink of\nhis misery; think of his danger\u2014look at his state when left alone; remember his\nheadlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair\u2014soothe him;\nsave him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his. Who in the world\ncares for you? or who will be injured by what you do?\u201d\n \nStill indomitable was the reply\u2014\u201cI care for myself. The more solitary,\nthe more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\nI will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the\nprinciples received by me when I was sane, and not mad\u2014as I am now. Laws and\nprinciples are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such\nmoments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour;\nstringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I\nmight break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth\u2014so I have always\nbelieved; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane\u2014quite\ninsane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can\ncount its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I\nhave at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.\u201d\n \nI did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. His fury was\nwrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he\ncrossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist. He seemed to devour\nme with his flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as\nstubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still\npossessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety. The soul,\nfortunately, has an interpreter\u2014often an unconscious, but still a truthful\ninterpreter\u2014in the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce\nface I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed\nstrength almost exhausted.\n \n\u201cNever,\u201d said he, as he ground his teeth, \u201cnever was anything at once so frail\nand so indomitable. A mere reed she feels in my hand!\u201d (And he shook me with\nthe force of his hold.) \u201cI could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what\ngood would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye:\nconsider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with\nmore than courage\u2014with a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot\nget at it\u2014the savage, beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight\nprison, my outrage will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the\nhouse; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself\npossessor of its clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit\u2014with will and\nenergy, and virtue and purity\u2014that I want: not alone your brittle frame. Of\nyourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you\nwould: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence\u2014you\nwill vanish ere I inhale your fragrance. Oh! come, Jane, come!\u201d\n \nAs he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me. The\nlook was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however,\nwould have succumbed now. I had dared and baffled his fury; I must elude his\nsorrow: I retired to the door.\n \n\u201cYou are going, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am going, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are leaving me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my\nwild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?\u201d\n \nWhat unutterable pathos was in his voice! How hard it was to reiterate firmly,\n\u201cI am going.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane!\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester!\u201d\n \n\u201cWithdraw, then,\u2014I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up\nto your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my\nsufferings\u2014think of me.\u201d\n \nHe turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. \u201cOh, Jane! my hope\u2014my\nlove\u2014my life!\u201d broke in anguish from his lips. Then came a deep, strong sob.\n \nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back\u2014walked back as\ndeterminedly as I had retreated. I knelt down by him; I turned his face from\nthe cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my hand.\n \n\u201cGod bless you, my dear master!\u201d I said. \u201cGod keep you from harm and\nwrong\u2014direct you, solace you\u2014reward you well for your past kindness to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cLittle Jane\u2019s love would have been my best reward,\u201d he answered; \u201cwithout it,\nmy heart is broken. But Jane will give me her love: yes\u2014nobly, generously.\u201d\n \nUp the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he\nsprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the\nroom.\n \n\u201cFarewell!\u201d was the cry of my heart as I left him. Despair added, \u201cFarewell for\never!\u201d\n \nThat night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay\ndown in bed. I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: I dreamt\nI lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind\nimpressed with strange fears. The light that long ago had struck me into\nsyncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and\ntremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling. I lifted up my head\nto look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the\nmoon imparts to vapours she is about to sever. I watched her come\u2014watched with\nthe strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on\nher disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first\npenetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white\nhuman form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed\nand gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet\nso near, it whispered in my heart\u2014\n \n\u201cMy daughter, flee temptation.\u201d\n \n\u201cMother, I will.\u201d\n \nSo I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night,\nbut July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes. \u201cIt cannot be too\nearly to commence the task I have to fulfil,\u201d thought I. I rose: I was dressed;\nfor I had taken off nothing but my shoes. I knew where to find in my drawers\nsome linen, a locket, a ring. In seeking these articles, I encountered the\nbeads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.\nI left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride\u2019s who had melted in\nair. The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty\nshillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,\npinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet,\nand stole from my room.\n \n\u201cFarewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d I whispered, as I glided past her door.\n\u201cFarewell, my darling Ad\u00e8le!\u201d I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. No\nthought could be admitted of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine\near: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\n \nI would have got past Mr. Rochester\u2019s chamber without a pause; but my heart\nmomentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop\nalso. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall;\nand again and again he sighed while I listened. There was a heaven\u2014a temporary\nheaven\u2014in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say\u2014\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,\u201d and\na fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of this.\n \nThat kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day.\nHe would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He would have me sought\nfor: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his love rejected: he would\nsuffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of this too. My hand moved towards\nthe lock: I caught it back, and glided on.\n \nDrearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it\nmechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too,\na phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water, I\ngot some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely\nshaken of late, must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened\nthe door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great\ngates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.\nThrough that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\n \nA mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary\ndirection to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and\nwondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No reflection was to be allowed\nnow: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought\nwas to be given either to the past or the future. The first was a page so\nheavenly sweet\u2014so deadly sad\u2014that to read one line of it would dissolve my\ncourage and break down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like\nthe world when the deluge was gone by.\n \nI skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe it was a\nlovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the\nhouse, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling\nsky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to\nthe scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the\nblock and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping\nat the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering\u2014and oh! with\nagony I thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now\u2014in\nhis room\u2014watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay\nwith him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too\nlate; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement. As yet my flight, I\nwas sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his comforter\u2014his pride; his\nredeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin. Oh, that fear of his\nself-abandonment\u2014far worse than my abandonment\u2014how it goaded me! It was a\nbarbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it\nsickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in. Birds began singing in brake\nand copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What\nwas I? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I\nabhorred myself. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from\nself-respect. I had injured\u2014wounded\u2014left my master. I was hateful in my own\neyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As\nto my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled\nthe other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I\nwent like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the\nlimbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my\nface to the wet turf. I had some fear\u2014or hope\u2014that here I should die: but I was\nsoon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my\nfeet\u2014as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.\n \nWhen I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I\nsat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and lifted my hand; it\nstopped. I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off,\nand where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections. I asked for what sum he\nwould take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty;\nwell, he would try to make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the\ninside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its\nway.\n \nGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed\nsuch stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never\nappeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour left my\nlips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what\nyou wholly love.\n",
        "\nTwo days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a\nplace called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given,\nand I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile\noff by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take\nmy parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety;\nthere it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\n \nWhitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where\nfour roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and\nin darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these\npoint is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above\ntwenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have\nlighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this\nI see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of\nmountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be\nthin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west,\nnorth, and south\u2014white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the\nheather grows deep and wild to their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might\npass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am\ndoing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might\nbe questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and\nexcite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment\u2014not a\ncharm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are\u2014none that saw me would\nhave a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the universal\nmother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose.\n \nI struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing\nthe brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its\nturnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat\ndown under it. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head:\nthe sky was over that.\n \nSome time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that\nwild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me.\nIf a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a\nbull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man. Finding my apprehensions\nunfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening\ndeclined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only\nlistened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\n \nWhat was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do\nnothing and go nowhere!\u2014when a long way must yet be measured by my weary,\ntrembling limbs before I could reach human habitation\u2014when cold charity must be\nentreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost\ncertain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my\nwants relieved!\n \nI touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day.\nI looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm\nridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature\nseemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I,\nwho from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her\nwith filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her\nchild: my mother would lodge me without money and without price. I had one\nmorsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed\nthrough at noon with a stray penny\u2014my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming\nhere and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them\nwith the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by\nthis hermit\u2019s meal. I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose\nmy couch.\n \nBeside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in\nit; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to\ninvade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low,\nmossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least at the commencement\nof the night, cold.\n \nMy rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It plained\nof its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It trembled for\nMr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him\nwith ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it\nstill quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.\n \nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and\nher planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship\nof fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence\nmost when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in\nthe unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we\nread clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to\nmy knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw\nthe mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was\u2014what countless systems there\nswept space like a soft trace of light\u2014I felt the might and strength of God.\nSure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that\nneither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I turned my\nprayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr.\nRochester was safe: he was God\u2019s, and by God would he be guarded. I again\nnestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.\n \nBut next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little birds had\nleft their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather\nthe heath honey before the dew was dried\u2014when the long morning shadows were\ncurtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky\u2014I got up, and I looked round me.\n \nWhat a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor!\nEverywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run\nover the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the\nmoment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment,\npermanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and had a human being\u2019s wants:\nI must not linger where there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back\nat the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this\u2014that my Maker\nhad that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that\nthis weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now\nbut to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.\nLife, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains,\nand responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the\nsuffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out.\n \nWhitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and\nhigh. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice. I walked a long\ntime, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously\nyield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me\u2014might relax this forced action,\nand, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that\nclogged heart and limb\u2014I heard a bell chime\u2014a church bell.\n \nI turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills,\nwhose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a\nspire. All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and\ncornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied\nshades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny\nlea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a\nheavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows\nand their drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on:\nstrive to live and bend to toil like the rest.\n \nAbout two o\u2019clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of\nits one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.\nI coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a\ndegree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to\nhave some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my\nfellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the\ncauseway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one\nof these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my\nthroat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities\nof destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would\nbe accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.\n \nI entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a\nlady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How could she serve me? I\nwas seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared. I\ndared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I\nfelt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I\nwas tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to\nmy request. She pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep;\nbut conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.\nSoon I asked her \u201cif there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the\nvillage?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.\u201d\n \nI reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face with\nNecessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend,\nwithout a coin. I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere. Where?\n \n\u201cDid she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?\u201d\n \n\u201cNay; she couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?\u201d\n \n\u201cSome were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver\u2019s needle-factory,\nand at the foundry.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid Mr. Oliver employ women?\u201d\n \n\u201cNay; it was men\u2019s work.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what do the women do?\u201d\n \n\u201cI knawn\u2019t,\u201d was the answer. \u201cSome does one thing, and some another. Poor folk\nmun get on as they can.\u201d\n \nShe seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to\nimportune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I\ntook leave.\n \nI passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand\nand to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to\nenter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and\nreturning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now\nfor want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere\nmany minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching\nsomething\u2014a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at\nthe top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly\nblooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white door or\ntouch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of\nthe inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A\nmild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. In such a voice as\nmight be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame\u2014a voice wretchedly\nlow and faltering\u2014I asked if a servant was wanted here?\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d said she; \u201cwe do not keep a servant.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?\u201d I continued. \u201cI am\na stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter\nwhat.\u201d\n \nBut it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:\nbesides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position,\ntale. She shook her head, she \u201cwas sorry she could give me no information,\u201d and\nthe white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out. If she had\nheld it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread;\nfor I was now brought low.\n \nI could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect\nof aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not\nfar off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was\nso sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature\u2019s cravings, instinct kept me roaming\nround abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no\nsolitude\u2014rest no rest\u2014while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in\nmy side.\n \nI drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered\naway: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask\u2014no right\nto expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while\nI thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw\nthe church spire before me: I hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in\nthe middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no\ndoubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place\nwhere they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the\nclergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman\u2019s function to help\u2014at\nleast with advice\u2014those who wished to help themselves. I seemed to have\nsomething like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and\ngathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and\nknocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the\nparsonage?\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cWas the clergyman in?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cWould he be in soon?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, he was gone from home.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo a distance?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot so far\u2014happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden death of\nhis father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a\nfortnight longer.\u201d\n \n\u201cWas there any lady of the house?\u201d\n \n\u201cNay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;\u201d and of her, reader, I\ncould not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not\nyet beg; and again I crawled away.\n \nOnce more I took off my handkerchief\u2014once more I thought of the cakes of bread\nin the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang\nof famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the\nshop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I\nventured the request\u2014\u201cWould she give me a roll for this handkerchief?\u201d\n \nShe looked at me with evident suspicion: \u201cNay, she never sold stuff i\u2019 that\nway.\u201d\n \nAlmost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. \u201cHow could she\ntell where I had got the handkerchief?\u201d she said.\n \n\u201cWould she take my gloves?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! what could she do with them?\u201d\n \nReader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is\nenjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can\nscarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation,\nblent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to\nbe willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was\nwhat was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is\nfrequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be\nsure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me\nwith employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first\ntime, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would\nnot take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the\noffer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense\nnow. I am sick of the subject.\n \nA little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the\nfarmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I stopped and said\u2014\n \n\u201cWill you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.\u201d He cast on me a\nglance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from his loaf,\nand gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an\neccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf. As soon as I\nwas out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.\n \nI could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I\nhave before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground\nwas damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I\nhad again and again to change my quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity\nbefriended me. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was\nwet. Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I\nsought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food\npass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a\nmess of cold porridge into a pig trough. \u201cWill you give me that?\u201d I asked.\n \nShe stared at me. \u201cMother!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cthere is a woman wants me to give\nher these porridge.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell lass,\u201d replied a voice within, \u201cgive it her if she\u2019s a beggar. T\u2019 pig\ndoesn\u2019t want it.\u201d\n \nThe girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it\nravenously.\n \nAs the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had\nbeen pursuing an hour or more.\n \n\u201cMy strength is quite failing me,\u201d I said in a soliloquy. \u201cI feel I cannot go\nmuch farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the rain descends\nso, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do\notherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this\nfeeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation\u2014this total\nprostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.\nAnd why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle\nto retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is\nliving: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot\nsubmit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!\u2014direct me!\u201d\n \nMy glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed\nfar from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation\nsurrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more\ndrawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild\nand unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay\nbetween me and the dusky hill.\n \n\u201cWell, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,\u201d I\nreflected. \u201cAnd far better that crows and ravens\u2014if any ravens there be in\nthese regions\u2014should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be\nprisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper\u2019s grave.\u201d\n \nTo the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find a\nhollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all\nthe surface of the waste looked level. It showed no variation but of tint:\ngreen, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore\nonly heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but\nas mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the\ndaylight.\n \nMy eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing\namidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and\nthe ridges, a light sprang up. \u201cThat is an ignis fatuus,\u201d was my first\nthought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on, however, quite\nsteadily, neither receding nor advancing. \u201cIs it, then, a bonfire just\nkindled?\u201d I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it\ndid not diminish, so it did not enlarge. \u201cIt may be a candle in a house,\u201d I\nthen conjectured; \u201cbut if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away:\nand were it within a yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the\ndoor to have it shut in my face.\u201d\n \nAnd I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I lay still\na while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in\nthe distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I but\nhave stiffened to the still frost\u2014the friendly numbness of death\u2014it might have\npelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its\nchilling influence. I rose ere long.\n \nThe light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to\nwalk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It led me aslant\nover the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter,\nand was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell\ntwice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn\nhope: I must gain it.\n \nHaving crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached\nit; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed\nfrom a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees\u2014firs, apparently, from what I\ncould distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the\ngloom. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me\nand it. I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the\nrough stones of a low wall\u2014above it, something like palisades, and within, a\nhigh and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before me:\nit was a gate\u2014a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On each side\nstood a sable bush\u2014holly or yew.\n \nEntering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to\nview, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was\nobscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking\nthe door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the\nlozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground,\nmade still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose\nleaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.\nThe aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been\ndeemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage\nshooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a\nsanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in\nrows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a\nclock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my\nbeacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat\nrough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a\nstocking.\n \nI noticed these objects cursorily only\u2014in them there was nothing extraordinary.\nA group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the\nrosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young, graceful women\u2014ladies in every\npoint\u2014sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore\ndeep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very\nfair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the\nknee of one girl\u2014in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\n \nA strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were they? They\ncould not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked\nlike a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen\nsuch faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every\nlineament. I cannot call them handsome\u2014they were too pale and grave for the\nword: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.\nA stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\nthey frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books\nthey held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in\nthe task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had\nbeen shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could\nhear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and\nI even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman\u2019s\nknitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last,\nit was audible enough to me.\n \n\u201cListen, Diana,\u201d said one of the absorbed students; \u201cFranz and old Daniel are\ntogether in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has\nawakened in terror\u2014listen!\u201d And in a low voice she read something, of which not\none word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue\u2014neither French\nnor Latin. Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.\n \n\u201cThat is strong,\u201d she said, when she had finished: \u201cI relish it.\u201d The other\ngirl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated, while she\ngazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the\nlanguage and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I\nfirst heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me\u2014conveying no\nmeaning:\u2014\n \n\u201c\u2018Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.\u2019 Good! good!\u201d she\nexclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. \u201cThere you have a dim and\nmighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a hundred pages of\nfustian. \u2018Ich w\u00e4ge die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke\nmit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.\u2019 I like it!\u201d\n \nBoth were again silent.\n \n\u201cIs there ony country where they talk i\u2019 that way?\u201d asked the old woman,\nlooking up from her knitting.\n \n\u201cYes, Hannah\u2014a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other\nway.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, for sure case, I knawn\u2019t how they can understand t\u2019 one t\u2019other: and if\neither o\u2019 ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe could probably tell something of what they said, but not all\u2014for we are not\nas clever as you think us, Hannah. We don\u2019t speak German, and we cannot read it\nwithout a dictionary to help us.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what good does it do you?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe mean to teach it some time\u2014or at least the elements, as they say; and then\nwe shall get more money than we do now.\u201d\n \n\u201cVarry like: but give ower studying; ye\u2019ve done enough for to-night.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think we have: at least I\u2019m tired. Mary, are you?\u201d\n \n\u201cMortally: after all, it\u2019s tough work fagging away at a language with no master\nbut a lexicon.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I\nwonder when St. John will come home.\u201d\n \n\u201cSurely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch\nshe drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to\nlook at the fire in the parlour?\u201d\n \nThe woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I\nheard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\n \n\u201cAh, childer!\u201d said she, \u201cit fair troubles me to go into yond\u2019 room now: it\nlooks so lonesome wi\u2019 the chair empty and set back in a corner.\u201d\n \nShe wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.\n \n\u201cBut he is in a better place,\u201d continued Hannah: \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t wish him here\nagain. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou say he never mentioned us?\u201d inquired one of the ladies.\n \n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He had been a\nbit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John\nasked if he would like either o\u2019 ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him. He\nbegan again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day\u2014that is, a\nfortnight sin\u2019\u2014and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a\u2019most stark when\nyour brother went into t\u2019 chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that\u2019s t\u2019 last o\u2019\nt\u2019 old stock\u2014for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them \u2019at\u2019s\ngone; for all your mother wor mich i\u2019 your way, and a\u2019most as book-learned. She\nwor the pictur\u2019 o\u2019 ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.\u201d\n \nI thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I\nnow concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair complexioned and\nslenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence. One,\nto be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference\nin their style of wearing it; Mary\u2019s pale brown locks were parted and braided\nsmooth: Diana\u2019s duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock\nstruck ten.\n \n\u201cYe\u2019ll want your supper, I am sure,\u201d observed Hannah; \u201cand so will Mr. St. John\nwhen he comes in.\u201d\n \nAnd she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to\nwithdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching\nthem, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest,\nI had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More\ndesolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible\ndid it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to\nmake them believe in the truth of my wants and woes\u2014to induce them to vouchsafe\na rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it\nhesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah opened.\n \n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed me by\nthe light of the candle she held.\n \n\u201cMay I speak to your mistresses?\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cYou had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come from?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am a stranger.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is your business here at this hour?\u201d\n \n\u201cI want a night\u2019s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to\neat.\u201d\n \nDistrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll give you\na piece of bread,\u201d she said, after a pause; \u201cbut we can\u2019t take in a vagrant to\nlodge. It isn\u2019t likely.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo let me speak to your mistresses.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about now; it\nlooks very ill.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don\u2019t do wrong,\nthat\u2019s all. Here is a penny; now go\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cA penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don\u2019t shut the\ndoor:\u2014oh, don\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\n \n\u201cI must; the rain is driving in\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cTell the young ladies. Let me see them\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn\u2019t make\nsuch a noise. Move off.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I must die if I am turned away.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot you. I\u2019m fear\u2019d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk\u2019s\nhouses at this time o\u2019 night. If you\u2019ve any followers\u2014housebreakers or such\nlike\u2014anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we\nhave a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.\u201d Here the honest but inflexible servant\nclapped the door to and bolted it within.\n \nThis was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering\u2014a throe of true despair\u2014rent\nand heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I\nsank on the wet doorstep: I groaned\u2014I wrung my hands\u2014I wept in utter anguish.\nOh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror!\nAlas, this isolation\u2014this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope,\nbut the footing of fortitude was gone\u2014at least for a moment; but the last I\nsoon endeavoured to regain.\n \n\u201cI can but die,\u201d I said, \u201cand I believe in God. Let me try to wait His will in\nsilence.\u201d\n \nThese words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery\ninto my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there\u2014dumb and still.\n \n\u201cAll men must die,\u201d said a voice quite close at hand; \u201cbut all are not\ncondemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you\nperished here of want.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho or what speaks?\u201d I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable\nnow of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near\u2014what form,\nthe pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing.\nWith a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.\n \n\u201cIs it you, Mr. St. John?\u201d cried Hannah.\n \n\u201cYes\u2014yes; open quickly.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in\u2014your\nsisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about.\nThere has been a beggar-woman\u2014I declare she is not gone yet!\u2014laid down there.\nGet up! for shame! Move off, I say!\u201d\n \n\u201cHush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in\nexcluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and listened to\nboth you and her. I think this is a peculiar case\u2014I must at least examine into\nit. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.\u201d\n \nWith difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean, bright\nkitchen\u2014on the very hearth\u2014trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the\nlast degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother,\nMr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me.\n \n\u201cSt. John, who is it?\u201d I heard one ask.\n \n\u201cI cannot tell: I found her at the door,\u201d was the reply.\n \n\u201cShe does look white,\u201d said Hannah.\n \n\u201cAs white as clay or death,\u201d was responded. \u201cShe will fall: let her sit.\u201d\n \nAnd indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still possessed\nmy senses, though just now I could not speak.\n \n\u201cPerhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she is worn\nto nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!\u201d\n \n\u201cA mere spectre!\u201d\n \n\u201cIs she ill, or only famished?\u201d\n \n\u201cFamished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of bread.\u201d\n \nDiana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the\nfire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my\nlips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy\nin her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion\nspoke: \u201cTry to eat.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014try,\u201d repeated Mary gently; and Mary\u2019s hand removed my sodden bonnet and\nlifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon.\n \n\u201cNot too much at first\u2014restrain her,\u201d said the brother; \u201cshe has had enough.\u201d\nAnd he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\n \n\u201cA little more, St. John\u2014look at the avidity in her eyes.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now\u2014ask her her name.\u201d\n \nI felt I could speak, and I answered\u2014\u201cMy name is Jane Elliott.\u201d Anxious as ever\nto avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an alias.\n \n\u201cAnd where do you live? Where are your friends?\u201d\n \nI was silent.\n \n\u201cCan we send for any one you know?\u201d\n \nI shook my head.\n \n\u201cWhat account can you give of yourself?\u201d\n \nSomehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was\nbrought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and\ndisowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the mendicant\u2014to resume my\nnatural manner and character. I began once more to know myself; and when Mr.\nSt. John demanded an account\u2014which at present I was far too weak to render\u2014I\nsaid after a brief pause\u2014\n \n\u201cSir, I can give you no details to-night.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what, then,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you expect me to do for you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing,\u201d I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took\nthe word\u2014\n \n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d she asked, \u201cthat we have now given you what aid you require? and\nthat we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?\u201d\n \nI looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both\nwith power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her compassionate\ngaze with a smile, I said\u2014\u201cI will trust you. If I were a masterless and stray\ndog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I\nreally have no fear. Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much\ndiscourse\u2014my breath is short\u2014I feel a spasm when I speak.\u201d All three surveyed\nme, and all three were silent.\n \n\u201cHannah,\u201d said Mr. St. John, at last, \u201clet her sit there at present, and ask\nher no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and\nbread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.\u201d\n \nThey withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned\u2014I could not tell which. A\nkind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire. In an\nundertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant\u2019s aid,\nI contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a\nwarm, dry bed received me. I thanked God\u2014experienced amidst unutterable\nexhaustion a glow of grateful joy\u2014and slept.\n",
        "\nThe recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in\nmy mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts\nframed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow\nbed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and\nto have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of\nthe lapse of time\u2014of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I\nobserved when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they\nwere; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I\ncould not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.\nHannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I\nhad a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my\ncircumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in\nthe chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at\nmy bedside\u2014\n \n\u201cIt is very well we took her in.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had\nshe been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone through?\u201d\n \n\u201cStrange hardships, I imagine\u2014poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking;\nher accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and\nwet, were little worn and fine.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and\nwhen in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be\nagreeable.\u201d\n \nNever once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the\nhospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,\nmyself. I was comforted.\n \nMr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was\nthe result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. He pronounced it\nneedless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to\nherself. He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole\nsystem must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery\nwould be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few\nwords, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man\nlittle accustomed to expansive comment, \u201cRather an unusual physiognomy;\ncertainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.\u201d\n \n\u201cFar otherwise,\u201d responded Diana. \u201cTo speak truth, St. John, my heart rather\nwarms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit her\npermanently.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is hardly likely,\u201d was the reply. \u201cYou will find she is some young lady\nwho has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously\nleft them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not\nobstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of\nher tractability.\u201d He stood considering me some minutes; then added, \u201cShe looks\nsensible, but not at all handsome.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe is so ill, St. John.\u201d\n \n\u201cIll or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are\nquite wanting in those features.\u201d\n \nOn the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed,\nand turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed,\nthe dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the food was good\u2014void of the\nfeverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When she\nleft me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose\nand desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put on?\nOnly my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen\nin the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was\nspared the humiliation.\n \nOn a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk\nfrock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from it; the\ncreases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent. My very shoes and\nstockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of\nwashing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary\nprocess, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My\nclothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies\nwith a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking\u2014no speck of the\ndirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me,\nleft\u2014I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow\nlow passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.\n \nIt was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire.\nHannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to\neradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by\neducation: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Hannah had been cold\nand stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and\nwhen she saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.\n \n\u201cWhat, you have got up!\u201d she said. \u201cYou are better, then. You may sit you down\nin my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.\u201d\n \nShe pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, examining me\nevery now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to me, as she took some\nloaves from the oven, she asked bluntly\u2014\n \n\u201cDid you ever go a-begging afore you came here?\u201d\n \nI was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the\nquestion, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered\nquietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness\u2014\n \n\u201cYou are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than\nyourself or your young ladies.\u201d\n \nAfter a pause she said, \u201cI dunnut understand that: you\u2019ve like no house, nor no\nbrass, I guess?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a\nbeggar in your sense of the word.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you book-learned?\u201d she inquired presently.\n \n\u201cYes, very.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never been to a boarding-school?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was at a boarding-school eight years.\u201d\n \nShe opened her eyes wide. \u201cWhatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are you going\nto do with these gooseberries?\u201d I inquired, as she brought out a basket of the\nfruit.\n \n\u201cMak\u2019 \u2019em into pies.\u201d\n \n\u201cGive them to me and I\u2019ll pick them.\u201d\n \n\u201cNay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I must do something. Let me have them.\u201d\n \nShe consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress,\n\u201clest,\u201d as she said, \u201cI should mucky it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYe\u2019ve not been used to sarvant\u2019s wark, I see by your hands,\u201d she remarked.\n\u201cHappen ye\u2019ve been a dressmaker?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don\u2019t trouble your\nhead further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.\u201d\n \n\u201cSome calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?\u201d\n \n\u201cNay; he doesn\u2019t live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at home, he\nis in his own parish at Morton.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat village a few miles off?\n \n\u201cAye.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what is he?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is a parson.\u201d\n \nI remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had\nasked to see the clergyman. \u201cThis, then, was his father\u2019s residence?\u201d\n \n\u201cAye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt\n(great) grandfather afore him.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?\u201d\n \n\u201cAye; St. John is like his kirstened name.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cTheir father is dead?\u201d\n \n\u201cDead three weeks sin\u2019 of a stroke.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey have no mother?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe mistress has been dead this mony a year.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you lived with the family long?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will say so\nmuch for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.\u201d\n \nShe again regarded me with a surprised stare. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said, \u201cI was\nquite mista\u2019en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about,\nyou mun forgie me.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd though,\u201d I continued, rather severely, \u201cyou wished to turn me from the\ndoor, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o\u2019 th\u2019 childer nor\nof mysel: poor things! They\u2019ve like nobody to tak\u2019 care on \u2019em but me. I\u2019m like\nto look sharpish.\u201d\n \nI maintained a grave silence for some minutes.\n \n\u201cYou munnut think too hardly of me,\u201d she again remarked.\n \n\u201cBut I do think hardly of you,\u201d I said; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you why\u2014not so much\nbecause you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as\nbecause you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no \u2018brass\u2019 and no\nhouse. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am;\nand if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo more I ought,\u201d said she: \u201cMr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor\nwrang\u2014but I\u2019ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a\nraight down dacent little crater.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat will do\u2014I forgive you now. Shake hands.\u201d\n \nShe put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile\nillumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.\n \nHannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she made\nthe paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her\ndeceased master and mistress, and \u201cthe childer,\u201d as she called the young\npeople.\n \nOld Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as\nancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever\nsince it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, \u201caboon two hundred year old\u2014for\nall it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi\u2019 Mr. Oliver\u2019s\ngrand hall down i\u2019 Morton Vale. But she could remember Bill Oliver\u2019s father a\njourneyman needlemaker; and th\u2019 Rivers wor gentry i\u2019 th\u2019 owd days o\u2019 th\u2019\nHenrys, as onybody might see by looking into th\u2019 registers i\u2019 Morton Church\nvestry.\u201d Still, she allowed, \u201cthe owd maister was like other folk\u2014naught mich\nout o\u2019 t\u2019 common way: stark mad o\u2019 shooting, and farming, and sich like.\u201d The\nmistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the\n\u201cbairns\u201d had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor\never had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they\ncould speak; and they had always been \u201cof a mak\u2019 of their own.\u201d Mr. St. John,\nwhen he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as\nthey left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her their\nfather had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted\nturning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they\nmust provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long\nwhile, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father\u2019s\ndeath; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills\nabout. They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always\nsaid there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each\nother\u2014never fell out nor \u201cthreaped.\u201d She did not know where there was such a\nfamily for being united.\n \nHaving finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and\ntheir brother were now.\n \n\u201cGone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to\ntea.\u201d\n \nThey returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the\nkitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed through;\nthe two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the\npleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took\nmy hand: she shook her head at me.\n \n\u201cYou should have waited for my leave to descend,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still look\nvery pale\u2014and so thin! Poor child!\u2014poor girl!\u201d\n \nDiana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She possessed\neyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face seemed to me full of\ncharm. Mary\u2019s countenance was equally intelligent\u2014her features equally pretty;\nbut her expression was more reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more\ndistant. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will,\nevidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority\nsupported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect\npermitted, to an active will.\n \n\u201cAnd what business have you here?\u201d she continued. \u201cIt is not your place. Mary\nand I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to\nlicense\u2014but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am very well here.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.\u201d\n \n\u201cBesides, the fire is too hot for you,\u201d interposed Mary.\n \n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d added her sister. \u201cCome, you must be obedient.\u201d And still holding\nmy hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\n \n\u201cSit there,\u201d she said, placing me on the sofa, \u201cwhile we take our things off\nand get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little\nmoorland home\u2014to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah\nis baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.\u201d\n \nShe closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a\nbook or newspaper in his hand. I examined, first, the parlour, and then its\noccupant.\n \nThe parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable,\nbecause clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the\nwalnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of\nthe men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with\nglass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no\nsuperfluous ornament in the room\u2014not one modern piece of furniture, save a\nbrace of workboxes and a lady\u2019s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\neverything\u2014including the carpet and curtains\u2014looked at once well worn and well\nsaved.\n \nMr. St. John\u2014sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,\nkeeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed\u2014was\neasy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not\nhave been easier. He was young\u2014perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty\u2014tall,\nslender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in\noutline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It\nis seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.\nHe might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own\nbeing so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high\nforehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of\nfair hair.\n \nThis is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it describes\nscarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible,\nor even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about\nhis nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements\nwithin either restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor\neven direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed\nin and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on\nthe top of the oven.\n \n\u201cEat that now,\u201d she said: \u201cyou must be hungry. Hannah says you have had nothing\nbut some gruel since breakfast.\u201d\n \nI did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers now\nclosed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue\npictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an unceremonious directness, a\nsearching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which told that intention,\nand not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.\n \n\u201cYou are very hungry,\u201d he said.\n \n\u201cI am, sir.\u201d It is my way\u2014it always was my way, by instinct\u2014ever to meet the\nbrief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\n \n\u201cIt is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last\nthree days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your\nappetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.\u201d\n \n\u201cI trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,\u201d was my very\nclumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d he said coolly: \u201cwhen you have indicated to us the residence of your\nfriends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely\nwithout home and friends.\u201d\n \nThe three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in\ntheir glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak particularly of the young\nladies. St. John\u2019s eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a\nfigurative one were difficult to fathom. He seemed to use them rather as\ninstruments to search other people\u2019s thoughts, than as agents to reveal his\nown: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more\ncalculated to embarrass than to encourage.\n \n\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat you are completely isolated from every\nconnection?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to\nadmittance under any roof in England.\u201d\n \n\u201cA most singular position at your age!\u201d\n \nHere I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table\nbefore me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon explained the quest.\n \n\u201cYou have never been married? You are a spinster?\u201d\n \nDiana laughed. \u201cWhy, she can\u2019t be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St.\nJohn,\u201d said she.\n \n\u201cI am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.\u201d\n \nI felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections\nwere awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and\nthe emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to\nmy crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till\nthe trouble he had excited forced out tears as well as colour.\n \n\u201cWhere did you last reside?\u201d he now asked.\n \n\u201cYou are too inquisitive, St. John,\u201d murmured Mary in a low voice; but he\nleaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing\nlook.\n \n\u201cThe name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my\nsecret,\u201d I replied concisely.\n \n\u201cWhich, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St.\nJohn and every other questioner,\u201d remarked Diana.\n \n\u201cYet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd you need help, do you not?\u201d\n \n\u201cI need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put\nme in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which\nwill keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.\u201d\n \n\u201cI know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to\nthe utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell me what you\nhave been accustomed to do, and what you can do.\u201d\n \nI had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much\nso as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me\nto address this penetrating young judge steadily.\n \n\u201cMr. Rivers,\u201d I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at me,\nopenly and without diffidence, \u201cyou and your sisters have done me a great\nservice\u2014the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your\nnoble hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited\nclaim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I\nwill tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I\ncan tell without compromising my own peace of mind\u2014my own security, moral and\nphysical, and that of others.\n \n\u201cI am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could\nknow them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable institution.\nI will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as\na pupil, and two as a teacher\u2014Lowood Orphan Asylum, \u2014\u2014shire: you will have\nheard of it, Mr. Rivers?\u2014the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.\u201d\n \n\u201cI left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I obtained a\ngood situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days\nbefore I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to\nexplain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame\nattached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three.\nMiserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from\na house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed\nbut two points in planning my departure\u2014speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had\nto leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my\nhurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to\nWhitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two\nnights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a\nthreshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when\nbrought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you,\nMr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the\nshelter of your roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since\u2014for I have\nnot been insensible during my seeming torpor\u2014and I owe to their spontaneous,\ngenuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t make her talk any more now, St. John,\u201d said Diana, as I paused; \u201cshe is\nevidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss\nElliott.\u201d\n \nI gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias: I had forgotten\nmy new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at once.\n \n\u201cYou said your name was Jane Elliott?\u201d he observed.\n \n\u201cI did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at\npresent, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to\nme.\u201d\n \n\u201cYour real name you will not give?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to\nit, I avoid.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are quite right, I am sure,\u201d said Diana. \u201cNow do, brother, let her be at\npeace a while.\u201d\n \nBut when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably and\nwith as much acumen as ever.\n \n\u201cYou would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality\u2014you would wish, I\nsee, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters\u2019 compassion, and, above all,\nwith my charity (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I\nresent it\u2014it is just): you desire to be independent of us?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that\nis all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till\nthen, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless\ndestitution.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed you shall stay here,\u201d said Diana, putting her white hand on my\nhead. \u201cYou shall,\u201d repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative\nsincerity which seemed natural to her.\n \n\u201cMy sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,\u201d said Mr. St. John, \u201cas\nthey would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird some\nwintry wind might have driven through their casement. I feel more\ninclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to\ndo so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor\ncountry parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to\ndespise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as\nI can offer.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can\ndo,\u201d answered Diana for me; \u201cand you know, St. John, she has no choice of\nhelpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a\nnurse-girl, if I can be no better,\u201d I answered.\n \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. \u201cIf such is your spirit, I promise to\naid you, in my own time and way.\u201d\n \nHe now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea. I soon\nwithdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength\nwould permit.\n",
        "\nThe more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them. In a few\ndays I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out\nsometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse\nwith them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow\nme. There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by\nme for the first time\u2014the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes,\nsentiments, and principles.\n \nI liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what\nthey approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the\ngrey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its\nmouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs\u2014all grown aslant under the stress of\nmountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly\u2014and where no flowers but of\nthe hardiest species would bloom\u2014found a charm both potent and permanent. They\nclung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling\u2014to the hollow vale\ninto which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which\nwound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little\npasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to\na flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:\u2014they clung\nto this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment. I could\ncomprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the\nfascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye\nfeasted on the outline of swell and sweep\u2014on the wild colouring communicated to\nridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant\nbracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were\nto them\u2014so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the\nsoft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;\nthe moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the\nsame attraction as for them\u2014wound round my faculties the same spell that\nentranced theirs.\n \nIndoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and better\nread than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they\nhad trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full\nsatisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the\nday. Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short,\nperfectly.\n \nIf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana. Physically, she\nfar excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In her animal spirits\nthere was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my\nwonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I could talk a while when the\nevening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain\nto sit on a stool at Diana\u2019s feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen\nalternately to her and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I\nhad but touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I\nsaw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased\nand suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection\u2014of the\nstrongest kind\u2014was the result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and\ncolour-boxes were immediately at my service. My skill, greater in this one\npoint than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Mary would sit and watch me by\nthe hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent,\nassiduous pupil she made. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed\nlike hours, and weeks like days.\n \nAs to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly\nbetween me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of the distance\nyet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at home: a large\nproportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the\nscattered population of his parish.\n \nNo weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he\nwould, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed\nby his father\u2019s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty\u2014I\nscarcely know in which light he regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very\nunfavourable, his sisters would expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar\nsmile, more solemn than cheerful\u2014\n \n\u201cAnd if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these\neasy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to\nmyself?\u201d\n \nDiana and Mary\u2019s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes\nof apparently mournful meditation.\n \nBut besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with\nhim: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature.\nZealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, he yet\ndid not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should\nbe the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often,\nof an evening, when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he\nwould cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself\nup to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting\nmight be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.\n \nI think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it was\nto his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense\nof the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and\nhoary walls he called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in\nthe tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem\nto roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence\u2014never seek out or\ndwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.\n \nIncommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of\ngauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him preach in\nhis own church at Morton. I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past\nmy power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.\n \nIt began calm\u2014and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was\ncalm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon\nin the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language. This grew to\nforce\u2014compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind\nastonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened. Throughout\nthere was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern\nallusions to Calvinistic doctrines\u2014election, predestination, reprobation\u2014were\nfrequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced\nfor doom. When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened\nby his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me\u2014I\nknow not whether equally so to others\u2014that the eloquence to which I had been\nlistening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of\ndisappointment\u2014where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and\ndisquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John Rivers\u2014pure-lived, conscientious,\nzealous as he was\u2014had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all\nunderstanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than had I with my concealed\nand racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium\u2014regrets to which I have\nlatterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me\nruthlessly.\n \nMeantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and\nreturn to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses\nin a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in\nfamilies by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble\ndependents, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and\nappreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill\nof their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said\nnothing to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it\nbecame urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning, being\nleft alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the\nwindow-recess\u2014which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of\nstudy\u2014and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to\nframe my inquiry\u2014for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve\nglassing over such natures as his\u2014when he saved me the trouble by being the\nfirst to commence a dialogue.\n \nLooking up as I drew near\u2014\u201cYou have a question to ask of me?\u201d he said.\n \n\u201cYes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself\nto undertake?\u201d\n \n\u201cI found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both\nuseful and happy here\u2014as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and\nyour society gave them unusual pleasure\u2014I deemed it inexpedient to break in on\nyour mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should\nrender yours necessary.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd they will go in three days now?\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cYes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will\naccompany me; and this old house will be shut up.\u201d\n \nI waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first\nbroached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his look\ndenoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to recall him to a\ntheme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.\n \n\u201cWhat is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay will not\nhave increased the difficulty of securing it.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to\naccept.\u201d\n \nHe again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew impatient: a\nrestless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his\nface, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words could have done, and\nwith less trouble.\n \n\u201cYou need be in no hurry to hear,\u201d he said: \u201clet me frankly tell you, I have\nnothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain, recall, if you\nplease, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind\nman would help the lame. I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my\nfather\u2019s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling\ngrange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the\nyew-trees and holly-bushes in front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but\nof the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependent\u2019s crust among\nstrangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country\u2014not\nonly for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself\nhonoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation\nfrom fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that\nchurch-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,\n\u2018Rise, follow Me!\u2019\u201d\n \nSt. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep\nvoice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance. He\nresumed\u2014\n \n\u201cAnd since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of\npoverty and obscurity. You may even think it degrading\u2014for I see now\nyour habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the\nideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I\nconsider that no service degrades which can better our race. I hold that the\nmore arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer\u2019s task of\ntillage is appointed him\u2014the scantier the meed his toil brings\u2014the higher the\nhonour. His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the\nfirst pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles\u2014their captain was Jesus, the\nRedeemer, Himself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d I said, as he again paused\u2014\u201cproceed.\u201d\n \nHe looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read my\nface, as if its features and lines were characters on a page. The conclusions\ndrawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his succeeding observations.\n \n\u201cI believe you will accept the post I offer you,\u201d said he, \u201cand hold it for a\nwhile: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the\nnarrow and narrowing\u2014the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent;\nfor in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though\nof a different kind.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo explain,\u201d I urged, when he halted once more.\n \n\u201cI will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,\u2014how trivial\u2014how cramping.\nI shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my\nown master. I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month;\nbut while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.\nMorton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the\npoor were excluded from every hope of progress. I established one for boys: I\nmean now to open a second school for girls. I have hired a building for the\npurpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress\u2019s house.\nHer salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very\nsimply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only\ndaughter of the sole rich man in my parish\u2014Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a\nneedle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same lady pays for the\neducation and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she\nshall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and\nthe school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to\ndischarge in person. Will you be this mistress?\u201d\n \nHe put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an indignant, or\nat least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and\nfeelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in what light the lot would\nappear to me. In truth it was humble\u2014but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a\nsafe asylum: it was plodding\u2014but then, compared with that of a governess in a\nrich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers\nentered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble\u2014not unworthy\u2014not mentally\ndegrading, I made my decision.\n \n\u201cI thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you comprehend me?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a village school: your scholars will\nbe only poor girls\u2014cottagers\u2019 children\u2014at the best, farmers\u2019 daughters.\nKnitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to\nteach. What will you do with your accomplishments? What, with the largest\nportion of your mind\u2014sentiments\u2014tastes?\u201d\n \n\u201cSave them till they are wanted. They will keep.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou know what you undertake, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do.\u201d\n \nHe now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply\ngratified.\n \n\u201cAnd when will you commence the exercise of your function?\u201d\n \n\u201cI will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well: so be it.\u201d\n \nHe rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at me. He\nshook his head.\n \n\u201cWhat do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cYou will not stay at Morton long: no, no!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy? What is your reason for saying so?\u201d\n \n\u201cI read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the\nmaintenance of an even tenor in life.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am not ambitious.\u201d\n \nHe started at the word \u201cambitious.\u201d He repeated, \u201cNo. What made you think of\nambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find it out?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was speaking of myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, if you are not ambitious, you are\u2014\u201d He paused.\n \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n \n\u201cI was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the\nword, and been displeased. I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a\nmost powerful hold on you. I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your\nleisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour\nwholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content,\u201d he added, with\nemphasis, \u201cto live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains\u2014my nature,\nthat God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed\u2014made\nuseless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached contentment with\na humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of\nwater in God\u2019s service\u2014I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my\nrestlessness. Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some\nmeans.\u201d\n \nHe left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in the whole\nprevious month: yet still he puzzled me.\n \nDiana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for\nleaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as usual; but\nthe sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely\nconquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would be a different parting\nfrom any they had ever yet known. It would probably, as far as St. John was\nconcerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.\n \n\u201cHe will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,\u201d she said: \u201cnatural\naffection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he\nhides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in some things he\nis inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly\npermit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a\nmoment blame him for it. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my\nheart!\u201d And the tears gushed to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her\nwork.\n \n\u201cWe are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,\u201d she\nmurmured.\n \nAt that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate\npurposely to prove the truth of the adage, that \u201cmisfortunes never come\nsingly,\u201d and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the\ncup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a letter. He entered.\n \n\u201cOur uncle John is dead,\u201d said he.\n \nBoth the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared\nin their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.\n \n\u201cDead?\u201d repeated Diana.\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \nShe riveted a searching gaze on her brother\u2019s face. \u201cAnd what then?\u201d she\ndemanded, in a low voice.\n \n\u201cWhat then, Die?\u201d he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature. \u201cWhat\nthen? Why\u2014nothing. Read.\u201d\n \nHe threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to Mary.\nMary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All three looked at\neach other, and all three smiled\u2014a dreary, pensive smile enough.\n \n\u201cAmen! We can yet live,\u201d said Diana at last.\n \n\u201cAt any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,\u201d remarked Mary.\n \n\u201cOnly it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might have\nbeen,\u201d said Mr. Rivers, \u201cand contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what\nis.\u201d\n \nHe folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.\n \nFor some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.\n \n\u201cJane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,\u201d she said, \u201cand think us\nhard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as\nan uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was my mother\u2019s brother.\nMy father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by his advice that my father\nrisked most of his property in the speculation that ruined him. Mutual\nrecrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never\nreconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it\nappears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married,\nand had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely\nrelated than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for\nhis error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has\nbequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty\nguineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the\npurchase of three mourning rings. He had a right, of course, to do as he\npleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such\nnews. Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds\neach; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it\nwould have enabled him to do.\u201d\n \nThis explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made\nto it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day I left Marsh End for\nMorton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B\u2014\u2014. In a week,\nMr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was\nabandoned.\n",
        "\nMy home, then, when I at last find a home,\u2014is a cottage; a little room with\nwhitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a\ntable, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of\ntea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen,\nwith a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled\nwith my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends\nhas increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.\n \nIt is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan\nwho serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth. This morning,\nthe village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But three of the number can\nread: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a few sew a little. They speak\nwith the broadest accent of the district. At present, they and I have a\ndifficulty in understanding each other\u2019s language. Some of them are unmannered,\nrough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to\nlearn, and evince a disposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these\ncoarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of\ngentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,\nintelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those\nof the best-born. My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find\nsome happiness in discharging that office. Much enjoyment I do not expect in\nthe life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and\nexert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.\n \nWas I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare,\nhumble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to deceive myself, I must\nreply\u2014No: I felt desolate to a degree. I felt\u2014yes, idiot that I am\u2014I felt\ndegraded. I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the\nscale of social existence. I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty,\nthe coarseness of all I heard and saw round me. But let me not hate and despise\nmyself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong\u2014that is a great\nstep gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I shall get\nthe better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite\nsubdued. In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and\na change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for\ndisgust.\n \nMeantime, let me ask myself one question\u2014Which is better?\u2014To have surrendered\nto temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort\u2014no struggle;\u2014but to\nhave sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it;\nwakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have\nbeen now living in France, Mr. Rochester\u2019s mistress; delirious with his love\nhalf my time\u2014for he would\u2014oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He\ndid love me\u2014no one will ever love me so again. I shall never more know\nthe sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace\u2014for never to any one else\nshall I seem to possess these charms. He was fond and proud of me\u2014it is what no\nman besides will ever be.\u2014But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and\nabove all, feeling? Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool\u2019s\nparadise at Marseilles\u2014fevered with delusive bliss one hour\u2014suffocating with\nthe bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next\u2014or to be a\nvillage-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the\nhealthy heart of England?\n \nYes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and\nscorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment. God directed me\nto a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!\n \nHaving brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and\nlooked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my\ncottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village. The\nbirds were singing their last strains\u2014\n \n\u201cThe air was mild, the dew was balm.\u201d\n \nWhile I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere\nlong weeping\u2014and why? For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my\nmaster: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal\nfury\u2014consequences of my departure\u2014which might now, perhaps, be dragging him\nfrom the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.\nAt this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely\nvale of Morton\u2014I say lonely, for in that bend of it visible to me there\nwas no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees,\nand, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver\nand his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone\nframe of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny\ngarden from the meadow beyond it made me look up. A dog\u2014old Carlo, Mr. Rivers\u2019\npointer, as I saw in a moment\u2014was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John\nhimself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost\nto displeasure, fixed on me. I asked him to come in.\n \n\u201cNo, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for\nyou. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.\u201d\n \nI approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I thought,\nwith austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible\nupon it.\n \n\u201cHave you found your first day\u2019s work harder than you expected?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cOh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very\nwell.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut perhaps your accommodations\u2014your cottage\u2014your furniture\u2014have disappointed\nyour expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough; but\u2014\u201d I interrupted\u2014\n \n\u201cMy cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.\nAll I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I am not absolutely such a fool\nand sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate;\nbesides, five weeks ago I had nothing\u2014I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant;\nnow I have acquaintance, a home, a business. I wonder at the goodness of God;\nthe generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you feel solitude an oppression? The little house there behind you is dark\nand empty.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow\nimpatient under one of loneliness.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good\nsense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears\nof Lot\u2019s wife. What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but\nI counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look\nback: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is what I mean to do,\u201d I answered. St. John continued\u2014\n \n\u201cIt is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of\nnature; but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a\nmeasure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a\nsustenance they cannot get\u2014when our will strains after a path we may not\nfollow\u2014we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we\nhave but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden\nfood it longed to taste\u2014and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous\nfoot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us,\nif rougher than it.\n \n\u201cA year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a\nmistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death. I\nburnt for the more active life of the world\u2014for the more exciting toils of a\nliterary career\u2014for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather\nthan that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a\nvotary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my\ncurate\u2019s surplice. I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed,\nor I must die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and\nrelief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without\nbounds\u2014my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength,\nspread their wings, and mount beyond ken. God had an errand for me; to bear\nwhich afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the\nbest qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for\nthese all centre in the good missionary.\n \n\u201cA missionary I resolved to be. From that moment my state of mind changed; the\nfetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage\nbut its galling soreness\u2014which time only can heal. My father, indeed, imposed\nthe determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to\ncontend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an\nentanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder\u2014a last\nconflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have\nvowed that I will overcome\u2014and I leave Europe for the East.\u201d\n \nHe said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he\nhad ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.\nBoth he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the\nwicket. We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in\nthe vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then\nstart when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed\u2014\n \n\u201cGood evening, Mr. Rivers. And good evening, old Carlo. Your dog is quicker to\nrecognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his\ntail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me\nnow.\u201d\n \nIt was true. Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical\naccents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood yet, at\nthe close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had\nsurprised him\u2014his arm resting on the gate, his face directed towards the west.\nHe turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me,\nhad risen at his side. There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in\npure white\u2014a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when,\nafter bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long\nveil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect beauty\nis a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features\nas ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as\never her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in\nthis instance, the term. No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the\nyoung girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we\nsee them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy\neyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled\nbrow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\nrepose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and\nsmooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and\ngleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich,\nplenteous tresses\u2014all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal\nof beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I\nadmired her with my whole heart. Nature had surely formed her in a partial\nmood; and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed\nthis, her darling, with a grand-dame\u2019s bounty.\n \nWhat did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked myself\nthat question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as naturally, I\nsought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He had already withdrawn\nhis eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew\nby the wicket.\n \n\u201cA lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,\u201d he said, as he crushed\nthe snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\n \n\u201cOh, I only came home from S\u2014\u2014\u201d (she mentioned the name of a large town some\ntwenty miles distant) \u201cthis afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school,\nand that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and\nran up the valley to see her: this is she?\u201d pointing to me.\n \n\u201cIt is,\u201d said St. John.\n \n\u201cDo you think you shall like Morton?\u201d she asked of me, with a direct and na\u00efve\nsimplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\n \n\u201cI hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?\u201d\n \n\u201cQuite.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you like your house?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery much.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave I furnished it nicely?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery nicely, indeed.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have indeed. She is teachable and handy.\u201d (This then, I thought, is Miss\nOliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in\nthose of nature! What happy combination of the planets presided over her birth,\nI wonder?)\n \n\u201cI shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,\u201d she added. \u201cIt will be a\nchange for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr. Rivers, I\nhave been so gay during my stay at S\u2014\u2014. Last night, or rather this\nmorning, I was dancing till two o\u2019clock. The \u2014\u2014th regiment are stationed there\nsince the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they\nput all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.\u201d\n \nIt seemed to me that Mr. St. John\u2019s under lip protruded, and his upper lip\ncurled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the\nlower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave\nhim this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it\non her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. She answered it with\na second laugh, and laughter well became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her\nbright eyes.\n \nAs he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. \u201cPoor Carlo\nloves me,\u201d said she. \u201cHe is not stern and distant to his friends; and if\nhe could speak, he would not be silent.\u201d\n \nAs she patted the dog\u2019s head, bending with native grace before his young and\naustere master, I saw a glow rise to that master\u2019s face. I saw his solemn eye\nmelt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled\nthus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman. His chest\nheaved once, as if his large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had\nexpanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of\nliberty. But he curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing\nsteed. He responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made\nhim.\n \n\u201cPapa says you never come to see us now,\u201d continued Miss Oliver, looking up.\n\u201cYou are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this evening, and not very\nwell: will you return with me and visit him?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,\u201d answered St. John.\n \n\u201cNot a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when papa most\nwants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him.\nNow, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?\u201d\nShe filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of her own.\n \n\u201cI forgot!\u201d she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if shocked at\nherself. \u201cI am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It had slipped my\nmemory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.\nDiana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely.\nI am sure I pity you. Do come and see papa.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.\u201d\n \nMr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort it\ncost him thus to refuse.\n \n\u201cWell, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any\nlonger: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!\u201d\n \nShe held out her hand. He just touched it. \u201cGood evening!\u201d he repeated, in a\nvoice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment returned.\n \n\u201cAre you well?\u201d she asked. Well might she put the question: his face was\nblanched as her gown.\n \n\u201cQuite well,\u201d he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She went one\nway; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like\ndown the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.\n \nThis spectacle of another\u2019s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from\nexclusive meditation on my own. Diana Rivers had designated her brother\n\u201cinexorable as death.\u201d She had not exaggerated.\n",
        "\nI continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I\ncould. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my\nefforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature. Wholly untaught, with\nfaculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight,\nall dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst\nthem as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this\ndifference rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my\nrules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\nrustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves\nobliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of\nnatural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity,\nthat won both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in\ndoing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks\nregularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The rapidity of their\nprogress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride\nI took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and\nthey liked me. I had amongst my scholars several farmers\u2019 daughters: young\nwomen grown, almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I\ntaught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\nneedlework. I found estimable characters amongst them\u2014characters desirous of\ninformation and disposed for improvement\u2014with whom I passed many a pleasant\nevening hour in their own homes. Their parents then (the farmer and his wife)\nloaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple\nkindness, and in repaying it by a consideration\u2014a scrupulous regard to their\nfeelings\u2014to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which\nboth charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own\neyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\n \nI felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard\non all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles. To\nlive amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is\nlike \u201csitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;\u201d serene inward feelings bud and\nbloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled\nwith thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all,\nin the midst of this calm, this useful existence\u2014after a day passed in\nhonourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading\ncontentedly alone\u2014I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams\nmany-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy\u2014dreams\nwhere, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and\nromantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some\nexciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice,\nmeeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by\nhim\u2014the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its\nfirst force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how\nsituated. Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and\nthen the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the\nburst of passion. By nine o\u2019clock the next morning I was punctually opening the\nschool; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.\n \nRosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the school was\ngenerally made in the course of her morning ride. She would canter up to the\ndoor on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant. Anything more exquisite\nthan her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon\u2019s cap of black velvet\nplaced gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her\nshoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic\nbuilding, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children. She\ngenerally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily\ncatechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the\nyoung pastor\u2019s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,\neven when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door,\nif she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming features,\nthough they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very\nquiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working\nmuscle or darting glance could indicate.\n \nOf course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,\nconceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went up and\naddressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his\nhand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say, with his sad and\nresolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, \u201cI love you, and I know you\nprefer me. It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my\nheart, I believe you would accept it. But that heart is already laid on a\nsacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a\nsacrifice consumed.\u201d\n \nAnd then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften\nher radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in\ntransient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St.\nJohn, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when\nshe thus left him; but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish,\nfor the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides,\nhe could not bind all that he had in his nature\u2014the rover, the aspirant, the\npoet, the priest\u2014in the limits of a single passion. He could not\u2014he would\nnot\u2014renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace\nof Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his\nreserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.\n \nMiss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I had\nlearnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she was\ncoquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. She had\nbeen indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. She was hasty, but\ngood-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass\nshowed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed;\ninnocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay,\nlively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool\nobserver of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or\nthoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for\ninstance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I liked my\npupil Ad\u00e8le; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a\ncloser affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult\nacquaintance.\n \nShe had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only,\ncertainly, she allowed, \u201cnot one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat\nlittle soul enough, but he was an angel.\u201d I was, however, good, clever,\ncomposed, and firm, like him. I was a lusus natur\u00e6, she affirmed,\nas a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history, if known, would\nmake a delightful romance.\n \nOne evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not\noffensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer\nof my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of\nSchiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and\nsome sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one\nof my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and\non the surrounding moors. She was first transfixed with surprise, and then\nelectrified with delight.\n \n\u201cHad I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love\u2014what a\nmiracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first school in S\u2014\u2014. Would\nI sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea\nof copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then on a dark-blue\nsilk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut\ntresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural\ncurls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. I\npromised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then,\nI told her she must come and sit another day.\n \nShe made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself accompanied\nher next evening\u2014a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at\nwhose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.\nHe appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to\nme. The sketch of Rosamond\u2019s portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a\nfinished picture of it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend\nthe evening at Vale Hall.\n \nI went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of\nwealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I\nstayed. Her father was affable; and when he entered into conversation with me\nafter tea, he expressed in strong terms his approbation of what I had done in\nMorton school, and said he only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too\ngood for the place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.\n \n\u201cIndeed,\u201d cried Rosamond, \u201cshe is clever enough to be a governess in a high\nfamily, papa.\u201d\n \nI thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land.\nMr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers\u2014of the Rivers family\u2014with great respect. He said\nit was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house\nwere wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he\nconsidered the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an\nalliance with the best. He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a\nyoung man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was\nquite throwing a valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would\nthrow no obstacle in the way of Rosamond\u2019s union with St. John. Mr. Oliver\nevidently regarded the young clergyman\u2019s good birth, old name, and sacred\nprofession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.\n \nIt was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after helping me\nto clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her\naid. All about me was spotless and bright\u2014scoured floor, polished grate, and\nwell-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon\nbefore me to spend as I would.\n \nThe translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my\npalette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation,\nof completing Rosamond Oliver\u2019s miniature. The head was finished already: there\nwas but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of\ncarmine, too, to add to the ripe lips\u2014a soft curl here and there to the\ntresses\u2014a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was\nabsorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my\ndoor unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.\n \n\u201cI am come to see how you are spending your holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cNot, I hope, in\nthought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I\nmistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought\nyou a book for evening solace,\u201d and he laid on the table a new publication\u2014a\npoem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate\npublic of those days\u2014the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of\nour era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or\nrepine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power\nover either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their\npresence, their liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in\nheaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their\ndestruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let\nenvy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem:\nand without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell\u2014the\nhell of your own meanness.\n \nWhile I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of \u201cMarmion\u201d (for \u201cMarmion\u201d it\nwas), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall figure sprang erect\nagain with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at him: he shunned my eye. I\nknew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly; at the moment I felt\ncalmer and cooler than he: I had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I\nconceived an inclination to do him some good, if I could.\n \n\u201cWith all his firmness and self-control,\u201d thought I, \u201che tasks himself too far:\nlocks every feeling and pang within\u2014expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am\nsure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he\nthinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk.\u201d\n \nI said first, \u201cTake a chair, Mr. Rivers.\u201d But he answered, as he always did,\nthat he could not stay. \u201cVery well,\u201d I responded, mentally, \u201cstand if you like;\nbut you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for\nyou as it is for me. I\u2019ll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your\nconfidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed\none drop of the balm of sympathy.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs this portrait like?\u201d I asked bluntly.\n \n\u201cLike! Like whom? I did not observe it closely.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou did, Mr. Rivers.\u201d\n \nHe almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me\nastonished. \u201cOh, that is nothing yet,\u201d I muttered within. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be\nbaffled by a little stiffness on your part; I\u2019m prepared to go to considerable\nlengths.\u201d I continued, \u201cYou observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no\nobjection to your looking at it again,\u201d and I rose and placed it in his hand.\n \n\u201cA well-executed picture,\u201d he said; \u201cvery soft, clear colouring; very graceful\nand correct drawing.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?\u201d\n \nMastering some hesitation, he answered, \u201cMiss Oliver, I presume.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise\nto paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided\nyou admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I don\u2019t wish to throw away\nmy time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.\u201d\n \nHe continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he held\nit, the more he seemed to covet it. \u201cIt is like!\u201d he murmured; \u201cthe eye is well\nmanaged: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!\u201d\n \n\u201cWould it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting? Tell me\nthat. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a\nconsolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it\nbring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?\u201d\n \nHe now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he\nagain surveyed the picture.\n \n\u201cThat I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or\nwise is another question.\u201d\n \nSince I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her father\nwas not likely to oppose the match, I\u2014less exalted in my views than St.\nJohn\u2014had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate their union. It\nseemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr. Oliver\u2019s large\nfortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went and laid his genius out\nto wither, and his strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this\npersuasion I now answered\u2014\n \n\u201cAs far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take\nto yourself the original at once.\u201d\n \nBy this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before him,\nand with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it. I discerned he\nwas now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus\nfrankly addressed on a subject he had deemed unapproachable\u2014to hear it thus\nfreely handled\u2014was beginning to be felt by him as a new pleasure\u2014an unhoped-for\nrelief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their\nsentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is\nhuman after all; and to \u201cburst\u201d with boldness and good-will into \u201cthe silent\nsea\u201d of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.\n \n\u201cShe likes you, I am sure,\u201d said I, as I stood behind his chair, \u201cand her\nfather respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl\u2014rather thoughtless; but you\nwould have sufficient thought for both yourself and her. You ought to marry\nher.\u201d\n \n\u201cDoes she like me?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cCertainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you continually:\nthere is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is very pleasant to hear this,\u201d he said\u2014\u201cvery: go on for another quarter of\nan hour.\u201d And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon the table to\nmeasure the time.\n \n\u201cBut where is the use of going on,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhen you are probably preparing\nsome iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your\nheart?\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing:\nhuman love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing\nwith sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour\nprepared\u2014so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying\nplans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood\u2014the young germs\nswamped\u2014delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an\nottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver\u2019s feet:\nshe is talking to me with her sweet voice\u2014gazing down on me with those eyes\nyour skilful hand has copied so well\u2014smiling at me with these coral lips. She\nis mine\u2014I am hers\u2014this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say\nnothing\u2014my heart is full of delight\u2014my senses are entranced\u2014let the time I\nmarked pass in peace.\u201d\n \nI humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood silent.\nAmidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture\ndown, rose, and stood on the hearth.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthat little space was given to delirium and delusion. I rested\nmy temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her\nyoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in\nthe garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her promises are hollow\u2014her offers\nfalse: I see and know all this.\u201d\n \nI gazed at him in wonder.\n \n\u201cIt is strange,\u201d pursued he, \u201cthat while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly\u2014with\nall the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is\nexquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating\u2014I experience at the same time a\ncalm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she\nis not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year\nafter marriage; and that to twelve months\u2019 rapture would succeed a lifetime of\nregret. This I know.\u201d\n \n\u201cStrange indeed!\u201d I could not help ejaculating.\n \n\u201cWhile something in me,\u201d he went on, \u201cis acutely sensible to her charms,\nsomething else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she\ncould sympathise in nothing I aspired to\u2014co-operate in nothing I undertook.\nRosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary\u2019s\nwife? No!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme.\u201d\n \n\u201cRelinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for\na mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all\nambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race\u2014of carrying knowledge\ninto the realms of ignorance\u2014of substituting peace for war\u2014freedom for\nbondage\u2014religion for superstition\u2014the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must\nI relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have\nto look forward to, and to live for.\u201d\n \nAfter a considerable pause, I said\u2014\u201cAnd Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and\nsorrow of no interest to you?\u201d\n \n\u201cMiss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a\nmonth, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me; and will\nmarry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I should do.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are wasting\naway.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet\nunsettled\u2014my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, I\nreceived intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long\nexpecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and\nperhaps the three months may extend to six.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.\u201d\n \nAgain the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined that a\nwoman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in this sort of\ndiscourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and\nrefined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of\nconventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place\nby their heart\u2019s very hearthstone.\n \n\u201cYou are original,\u201d said he, \u201cand not timid. There is something brave in\nyour spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you\nthat you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them more profound and\npotent than they are. You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a\njust claim to. When I colour, and when I shake before Miss Oliver, I do not\npity myself. I scorn the weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the\nflesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed\nas a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am\u2014a\ncold hard man.\u201d\n \nI smiled incredulously.\n \n\u201cYou have taken my confidence by storm,\u201d he continued, \u201cand now it is much at\nyour service. I am simply, in my original state\u2014stripped of that blood-bleached\nrobe with which Christianity covers human deformity\u2014a cold, hard, ambitious\nman. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over\nme. Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire\nto rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance,\nperseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men\nachieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with\ninterest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic\nwoman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what\nyou still suffer.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cNo. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe;\nand I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a pagan, but a\nChristian philosopher\u2014a follower of the sect of Jesus. As His disciple I adopt\nHis pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I advocate them: I am sworn to\nspread them. Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities\nthus:\u2014From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the\novershadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human\nuprightness, she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition\nto win power and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to\nspread my Master\u2019s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.\nSo much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best\naccount; pruning and training nature. But she could not eradicate nature: nor\nwill it be eradicated \u2018till this mortal shall put on immortality.\u2019\u201d\n \nHaving said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my palette.\nOnce more he looked at the portrait.\n \n\u201cShe is lovely,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe is well named the Rose of the World,\nindeed!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd may I not paint one like it for you?\u201d\n \n\u201cCui bono? No.\u201d\n \nHe drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to\nrest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he\nsuddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but\nsomething had caught his eye. He took it up with a snatch; he looked at the\nedge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite\nincomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in\nmy shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His\nlips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it\nwas.\n \n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cNothing in the world,\u201d was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him\ndexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in his glove;\nand, with one hasty nod and \u201cgood-afternoon,\u201d he vanished.\n \n\u201cWell!\u201d I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, \u201cthat caps the globe,\nhowever!\u201d\n \nI, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy\nstains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pondered the mystery\na minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be\nof much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.\n",
        "\nWhen Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued\nall night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by\ntwilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable. I had closed my\nshutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it,\ntrimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to\nthe muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down \u201cMarmion,\u201d and\nbeginning\u2014\n \n\u201cDay set on Norham\u2019s castled steep,\nAnd Tweed\u2019s fair river broad and deep,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Cheviot\u2019s mountains lone;\nThe massive towers, the donjon keep,\nThe flanking walls that round them sweep,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In yellow lustre shone\u201d\u2014\n \nI soon forgot storm in music.\n \nI heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St. John\nRivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane\u2014the howling\ndarkness\u2014and stood before me: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white\nas a glacier. I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest\nfrom the blocked-up vale that night.\n \n\u201cAny ill news?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHas anything happened?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. How very easily alarmed you are!\u201d he answered, removing his cloak and\nhanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat\nwhich his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow from his boots.\n \n\u201cI shall sully the purity of your floor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you must excuse me for\nonce.\u201d Then he approached the fire. \u201cI have had hard work to get here, I assure\nyou,\u201d he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame. \u201cOne drift took me up\nto the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut why are you come?\u201d I could not forbear saying.\n \n\u201cRather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I\nanswer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and\nempty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a\nperson to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the\nsequel.\u201d\n \nHe sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began\nto fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his was a very cool\nand collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his\nlook more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he put aside his\nsnow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale\nbrow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of\ncare or sorrow now so plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say\nsomething I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his\nfinger on his lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted\nlike his face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was\nmoved to say\u2014\n \n\u201cI wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you\nshould be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said he: \u201cI care for myself when necessary. I am well now. What\ndo you see amiss in me?\u201d\n \nThis was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my\nsolicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I was silenced.\n \nHe still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt\ndreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, I asked him\npresently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind him.\n \n\u201cNo, no!\u201d he responded shortly and somewhat testily.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d I reflected, \u201cif you won\u2019t talk, you may be still; I\u2019ll let you alone\nnow, and return to my book.\u201d\n \nSo I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of \u201cMarmion.\u201d He soon stirred;\nmy eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a morocco\npocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence, folded it, put\nit back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain to try to read with such an\ninscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in impatience, consent to be dumb;\nhe might rebuff me if he liked, but talk I would.\n \n\u201cHave you heard from Diana and Mary lately?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot since the letter I showed you a week ago.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You will not\nbe summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?\u201d\n \n\u201cI fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.\u201d Baffled so far, I\nchanged my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars.\n \n\u201cMary Garrett\u2019s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this\nmorning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close\u2014they\nwould have come to-day but for the snow.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed!\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Oliver pays for two.\u201d\n \n\u201cDoes he?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.\u201d\n \n\u201cI know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWas it your suggestion?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhose, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cHis daughter\u2019s, I think.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is like her: she is so good-natured.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \nAgain came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It aroused\nhim; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.\n \n\u201cLeave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,\u201d he said.\n \nWondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.\n \n\u201cHalf-an-hour ago,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of\na tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming\nthe narrator\u2019s part, and converting you into a listener. Before commencing, it\nis but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your\nears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass\nthrough new lips. For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.\n \n\u201cTwenty years ago, a poor curate\u2014never mind his name at this moment\u2014fell in\nlove with a rich man\u2019s daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him,\nagainst the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her\nimmediately after the wedding. Before two years passed, the rash pair were both\ndead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (I have seen their grave;\nit formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim,\nsoot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in \u2014\u2014shire.) They\nleft a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap\u2014cold as\nthat of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried the\nfriendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by\nan aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead. You\nstart\u2014did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the\nrafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and\naltered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.\u2014To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept\nthe orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never\nhaving been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you\nknow\u2014being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It\nseems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher,\nlike yourself\u2014really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and\nyours\u2014she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous;\nshe undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rivers!\u201d I interrupted.\n \n\u201cI can guess your feelings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut restrain them for a while: I have\nnearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester\u2019s character I know\nnothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to\nthis young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet\nalive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a\nmatter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry\nafter the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone\u2014no one could tell\nwhen, where, or how. She had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research\nafter her course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no\nvestige of information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be\nfound is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in\nall the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a\nsolicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is it not an odd\ntale?\u201d\n \n\u201cJust tell me this,\u201d said I, \u201cand since you know so much, you surely can\ntell it me\u2014what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he doing? Is he\nwell?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him\nbut to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. You\nshould rather ask the name of the governess\u2014the nature of the event which\nrequires her appearance.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \n\u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut they wrote to him?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what did he say? Who has his letters?\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.\nRochester, but from a lady: it is signed \u2018Alice Fairfax.\u2019\u201d\n \nI felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had in all\nprobability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former\nhaunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe sufferings\u2014what object\nfor his strong passions\u2014had he sought there? I dared not answer the question.\nOh, my poor master\u2014once almost my husband\u2014whom I had often called \u201cmy dear\nEdward!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe must have been a bad man,\u201d observed Mr. Rivers.\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know him\u2014don\u2019t pronounce an opinion upon him,\u201d I said, with warmth.\n \n\u201cVery well,\u201d he answered quietly: \u201cand indeed my head is otherwise occupied\nthan with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won\u2019t ask the governess\u2019s\nname, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it here\u2014it is always more\nsatisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black\nand white.\u201d\n \nAnd the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through;\nfrom one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn\noff: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and\nvermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover. He got up, held it close\nto my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words\n\u201cJANE EYRE\u201d\u2014the work doubtless of some moment of\nabstraction.\n \n\u201cBriggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:\u201d he said, \u201cthe advertisements demanded a\nJane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.\u2014I confess I had my suspicions, but it was\nonly yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty. You own the\nname and renounce the alias?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than\nyou do.\u201d\n \n\u201cBriggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr.\nRochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime, you forget\nessential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought\nafter you\u2014what he wanted with you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, what did he want?\u201d\n \n\u201cMerely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has\nleft you all his property, and that you are now rich\u2014merely that\u2014nothing more.\u201d\n \n\u201cI!\u2014rich?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, you, rich\u2014quite an heiress.\u201d\n \nSilence succeeded.\n \n\u201cYou must prove your identity of course,\u201d resumed St. John presently: \u201ca step\nwhich will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession.\nYour fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the\nnecessary documents.\u201d\n \nHere was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a\nmoment from indigence to wealth\u2014a very fine thing; but not a matter one can\ncomprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then there are other\nchances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this is solid, an\naffair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its associations are\nsolid and sober, and its manifestations are the same. One does not jump, and\nspring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to\nconsider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady\nsatisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over\nour bliss with a solemn brow.\n \nBesides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death,\nFuneral. My uncle I had heard was dead\u2014my only relative; ever since being made\naware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now, I\nnever should. And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing\nfamily, but to my isolated self. It was a grand boon doubtless; and\nindependence would be glorious\u2014yes, I felt that\u2014that thought swelled my\nheart.\n \n\u201cYou unbend your forehead at last,\u201d said Mr. Rivers. \u201cI thought Medusa had\nlooked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how\nmuch you are worth?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow much am I worth?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of\u2014twenty thousand pounds, I think\nthey say\u2014but what is that?\u201d\n \n\u201cTwenty thousand pounds?\u201d\n \nHere was a new stunner\u2014I had been calculating on four or five thousand. This\nnews actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard\nlaugh before, laughed now.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cif you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime\nwas discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is a large sum\u2014don\u2019t you think there is a mistake?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo mistake at all.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps you have read the figures wrong\u2014it may be two thousand!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is written in letters, not figures,\u2014twenty thousand.\u201d\n \nI again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers\nsitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred.\nMr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.\n \n\u201cIf it were not such a very wild night,\u201d he said, \u201cI would send Hannah down to\nkeep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone. But\nHannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I: her legs are not\nquite so long: so I must e\u2019en leave you to your sorrows. Good-night.\u201d\n \nHe was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.\n \n\u201cStop one minute!\u201d I cried.\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he knew\nyou, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the\npower to aid in my discovery.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! I am a clergyman,\u201d he said; \u201cand the clergy are often appealed to about\nodd matters.\u201d Again the latch rattled.\n \n\u201cNo; that does not satisfy me!\u201d I exclaimed: and indeed there was something in\nthe hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my\ncuriosity more than ever.\n \n\u201cIt is a very strange piece of business,\u201d I added; \u201cI must know more about it.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnother time.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; to-night!\u2014to-night!\u201d and as he turned from the door, I placed myself\nbetween it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.\n \n\u201cYou certainly shall not go till you have told me all,\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cI would rather not just now.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou shall!\u2014you must!\u201d\n \n\u201cI would rather Diana or Mary informed you.\u201d\n \nOf course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must\nbe, and that without delay; and I told him so.\n \n\u201cBut I apprised you that I was a hard man,\u201d said he, \u201cdifficult to persuade.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I am a hard woman,\u2014impossible to put off.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd then,\u201d he pursued, \u201cI am cold: no fervour infects me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed all the\nsnow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and\nmade it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers,\nthe high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I\nwish to know.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, \u201cI yield; if not to your earnestness, to your\nperseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must know\nsome day,\u2014as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course: that was all settled before.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?\u2014that I was christened St.\nJohn Eyre Rivers?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials\nwritten in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for\nwhat name it stood. But what then? Surely\u2014\u201d\n \nI stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the\nthought that rushed upon me\u2014that embodied itself,\u2014that, in a second, stood out\na strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves,\nshot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of\nlinks was drawn out straight,\u2014every ring was perfect, the connection complete.\nI knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another\nword; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so\nI must repeat his explanation.\n \n\u201cMy mother\u2019s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married\nMiss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of\nFunchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre\u2019s solicitor, wrote to us last\nAugust to inform us of our uncle\u2019s death, and to say that he had left his\nproperty to his brother the clergyman\u2019s orphan daughter, overlooking us, in\nconsequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote\nagain a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if\nwe knew anything of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled\nme to find her out. You know the rest.\u201d Again he was going, but I set my back\nagainst the door.\n \n\u201cDo let me speak,\u201d I said; \u201clet me have one moment to draw breath and reflect.\u201d\nI paused\u2014he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed\u2014\n \n\u201cYour mother was my father\u2019s sister?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy aunt, consequently?\u201d\n \nHe bowed.\n \n\u201cMy uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his sister\u2019s\nchildren, as I am his brother\u2019s child?\u201d\n \n\u201cUndeniably.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the\nsame source?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are cousins; yes.\u201d\n \nI surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud of,\u2014one I\ncould love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them\nbut as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and\nadmiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and\nlooking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed\nwith so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and\nthe young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold\nwas my blood relation. Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth\nindeed!\u2014wealth to the heart!\u2014a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a\nblessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;\u2014not like the ponderous gift of gold:\nrich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now clapped\nmy hands in sudden joy\u2014my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.\n \n\u201cOh, I am glad!\u2014I am glad!\u201d I exclaimed.\n \nSt. John smiled. \u201cDid I not say you neglected essential points to pursue\ntrifles?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou were serious when I told you you had got a fortune;\nand now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat can you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and\ndon\u2019t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,\u2014or two, if\nyou don\u2019t choose to be counted,\u2014are born into my world full-grown. I say again,\nI am glad!\u201d\n \nI walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts\nthat rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them:\u2014thoughts of\nwhat might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long. I looked at the\nblank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,\u2014every one lit me to a\npurpose or delight. Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had\nloved barrenly, I could now benefit. They were under a yoke,\u2014I could free them:\nthey were scattered,\u2014I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence\nwhich was mine, might be theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds\nshared equally would be five thousand each, justice\u2014enough and to spare:\njustice would be done,\u2014mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh\non me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,\u2014it was a legacy of life, hope,\nenjoyment.\n \nHow I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell;\nbut I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was\ngently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also advised me to be composed;\nI scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off his hand,\nand began to walk about again.\n \n\u201cWrite to Diana and Mary to-morrow,\u201d I said, \u201cand tell them to come home\ndirectly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand\npounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell me where I can get you a glass of water,\u201d said St. John; \u201cyou must really\nmake an effort to tranquillise your feelings.\u201d\n \n\u201cNonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you? Will it\nkeep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an\nordinary mortal?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in\ncommunicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you\nwho misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend\nbetter.\u201d\n \n\u201cExplain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand\npounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three\nnieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each? What I want is, that you\nshould write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to\nthem.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo you, you mean.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other. I am\nnot brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am\nresolved I will have a home and connections. I like Moor House, and I will live\nat Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to\nDiana and Mary. It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it\nwould torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could\nnever be mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what\nis absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no discussion\nabout it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a\nmatter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the\ncase?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom. Besides,\nthe entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; he was\nfree to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you. After all, justice\npermits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it\nabsolutely your own.\u201d\n \n\u201cWith me,\u201d said I, \u201cit is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I\nmust indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so. Were\nyou to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious\npleasure of which I have caught a glimpse\u2014that of repaying, in part, a mighty\nobligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou think so now,\u201d rejoined St. John, \u201cbecause you do not know what it is to\npossess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the\nimportance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable\nyou to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you,\u201d I interrupted, \u201ccannot at all imagine the craving I have for\nfraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers or\nsisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and\nown me, are you?\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, I will be your brother\u2014my sisters will be your sisters\u2014without\nstipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.\u201d\n \n\u201cBrother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes; slaving\namongst strangers! I, wealthy\u2014gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit!\nYou, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate\nattachment!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be\nrealised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry.\u201d\n \n\u201cNonsense, again! Marry! I don\u2019t want to marry, and never shall marry.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the\nexcitement under which you labour.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my\ninclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for love;\nand I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation. And I do\nnot want a stranger\u2014unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my\nkindred: those with whom I have full fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my\nbrother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you\ncan, repeat them sincerely.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what\nmy affection for them is grounded,\u2014respect for their worth and admiration of\ntheir talents. You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble\nDiana\u2019s and Mary\u2019s; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your\nconversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace. I feel I can\neasily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest\nsister.\u201d\n \n\u201cThank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for if you\nstay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.\u201d\n \nHe smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.\n \nI need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used,\nto get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My task was a very\nhard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved\u2014as my cousins saw at length that my\nmind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the\nproperty\u2014as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the\nintention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place\nthey would have done precisely what I wished to do\u2014they yielded at length so\nfar as to consent to put the affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr.\nOliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.\nThe instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each\nbecame possessed of a competency.\n",
        "\nIt was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general\nholiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting\nshould not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens the hand as well as the\nheart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but\nto afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt\nwith pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted,\nthat consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and\nstrongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their\nunsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future\nthat I did not visit them, and give them an hour\u2019s teaching in their school.\n \nMr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file\nout before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging\na few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as\ndecent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in\nthe ranks of the British peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after\nall, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most\nself-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and\nB\u00e4uerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and\nbesotted, compared with my Morton girls.\n \n\u201cDo you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?\u201d asked Mr.\nRivers, when they were gone. \u201cDoes not the consciousness of having done some\nreal good in your day and generation give pleasure?\u201d\n \n\u201cDoubtless.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the task of\nregenerating your race be well spent?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d I said; \u201cbut I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own\nfaculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must enjoy them now;\ndon\u2019t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed\nfor full holiday.\u201d\n \nHe looked grave. \u201cWhat now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are\nyou going to do?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set Hannah at\nliberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you want her?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a week,\nand I want to have everything in order against their arrival.\u201d\n \n\u201cI understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It is\nbetter so: Hannah shall go with you.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will\ngive you the key of my cottage in the morning.\u201d\n \nHe took it. \u201cYou give it up very gleefully,\u201d said he; \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\nyour light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to\nyourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing. What aim, what\npurpose, what ambition in life have you now?\u201d\n \n\u201cMy first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full force of\nthe expression?)\u2014to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar; my\nnext to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till\nit glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with\nmathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and\npeat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding\nthat on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to\nsuch a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of\nChristmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of\nother culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the\nuninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an\nabsolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday;\nand my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.\u201d\n \nSt. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.\n \n\u201cIt is all very well for the present,\u201d said he; \u201cbut seriously, I trust that\nwhen the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than\ndomestic endearments and household joys.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe best things the world has!\u201d I interrupted.\n \n\u201cNo, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make\nit so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.\u201d\n \n\u201cI mean, on the contrary, to be busy.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, I excuse you for the present: two months\u2019 grace I allow you for the full\nenjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found\ncharm of relationship; but then, I hope you will begin to look beyond\nMoor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual\ncomfort of civilised affluence. I hope your energies will then once more\ntrouble you with their strength.\u201d\n \nI looked at him with surprise. \u201cSt. John,\u201d I said, \u201cI think you are almost\nwicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to\nstir me up to restlessness! To what end?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your\nkeeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account. Jane, I\nshall watch you closely and anxiously\u2014I warn you of that. And try to restrain\nthe disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace\nhome pleasures. Don\u2019t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your\nconstancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite\ntransient objects. Do you hear, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause to be\nhappy, and I will be happy. Goodbye!\u201d\n \nHappy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was\ncharmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned\ntopsy-turvy\u2014how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after\na day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to\ninvoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a\njourney to S\u2014\u2014 to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me\ncarte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having\nbeen set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left\nmuch as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from\nseeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\nspectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was necessary, to\ngive to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested. Dark\nhandsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected\nantique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and\ndressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh\nwithout being glaring. A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with\nold mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets\non the stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\nof bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of\nwintry waste and desert dreariness without.\n \nThe eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark, and ere\ndusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah\nand I were dressed, and all was in readiness.\n \nSt. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house\ntill everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at\nonce sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to\nestrangement. He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain\ncakes for tea, then baking. Approaching the hearth, he asked, \u201cIf I was at last\nsatisfied with housemaid\u2019s work?\u201d I answered by inviting him to accompany me on\na general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I got\nhim to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I opened; and\nwhen he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through\na great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes\nin so short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the\nimproved aspect of his abode.\n \nThis silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some\nold associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a\nsomewhat crest-fallen tone.\n \n\u201cNot at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\nrespected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more\nthought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for instance, had I\ndevoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?\u2014By-the-bye, could I tell\nhim where such a book was?\u201d\n \nI showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to his\naccustomed window recess, he began to read it.\n \nNow, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began to feel\nhe had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold. The\nhumanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him\u2014its peaceful\nenjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to aspire\u2014after what was good and\ngreat, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor approve of others resting\nround him. As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white\nstone\u2014at his fine lineaments fixed in study\u2014I comprehended all at once that he\nwould hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his\nwife. I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;\nI agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended how he\nshould despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he\nshould wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever\nconducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I saw he was of the material\nfrom which nature hews her heroes\u2014Christian and Pagan\u2014her lawgivers, her\nstatesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest\nupon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of\nplace.\n \n\u201cThis parlour is not his sphere,\u201d I reflected: \u201cthe Himalayan ridge or Caffre\nbush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better. Well may\nhe eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties\nstagnate\u2014they cannot develop or appear to advantage. It is in scenes of strife\nand danger\u2014where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude\ntasked\u2014that he will speak and move, the leader and superior. A merry child\nwould have the advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a\nmissionary\u2019s career\u2014I see it now.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are coming! they are coming!\u201d cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour\ndoor. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark;\nbut a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The\nvehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one\nwell-known form, then another, stepped out. In a minute I had my face under\ntheir bonnets, in contact first with Mary\u2019s soft cheek, then with Diana\u2019s\nflowing curls. They laughed\u2014kissed me\u2014then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half\nwild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the\naffirmative, hastened into the house.\n \nThey were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled\nwith the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the\ncheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they\ndemanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from the parlour. They both threw\ntheir arms round his neck at once. He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low\ntone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then,\nintimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew\nthere as to a place of refuge.\n \nI had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable\norders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me. They were delighted\nwith the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and\nfresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification\nungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their\nwishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous\nreturn home.\n \nSweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in\nnarrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John\u2019s taciturnity: he\nwas sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of\njoy he could not sympathise. The event of the day\u2014that is, the return of Diana\nand Mary\u2014pleased him; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult,\nthe garrulous glee of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow\nwas come. In the very meridian of the night\u2019s enjoyment, about an hour after\ntea, a rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that \u201ca\npoor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his\nmother, who was drawing away.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere does she live, Hannah?\u201d\n \n\u201cClear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the\nway.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell him I will go.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure, sir, you had better not. It\u2019s the worst road to travel after dark\nthat can be: there\u2019s no track at all over the bog. And then it is such a bitter\nnight\u2014the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send word, sir, that you\nwill be there in the morning.\u201d\n \nBut he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one\nobjection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o\u2019clock: he did not return\ntill midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when\nhe set out. He had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his own\nstrength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.\n \nI am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was Christmas\nweek: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry\ndomestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of\nprosperity, acted on Diana and Mary\u2019s spirits like some life-giving elixir:\nthey were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. They could\nalways talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for\nme, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.\nSt. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in\nthe house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily\nbusiness in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\n \nOne morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some\nminutes, asked him, \u201cIf his plans were yet unchanged.\u201d\n \n\u201cUnchanged and unchangeable,\u201d was the reply. And he proceeded to inform us that\nhis departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.\n \n\u201cAnd Rosamond Oliver?\u201d suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips\ninvoluntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a gesture as\nif wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his hand\u2014it was his unsocial\ncustom to read at meals\u2014he closed it, and looked up.\n \n\u201cRosamond Oliver,\u201d said he, \u201cis about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the\nbest connected and most estimable residents in S\u2014\u2014, grandson and heir to Sir\nFrederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.\u201d\n \nHis sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him: he was\nserene as glass.\n \n\u201cThe match must have been got up hastily,\u201d said Diana: \u201cthey cannot have known\neach other long.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut two months: they met in October at the county ball at S\u2014\u2014. But where there\nare no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in\nevery point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as\nS\u2014\u2014 Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can be refitted for their\nreception.\u201d\n \nThe first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted\nto inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little to need\nsympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I experienced some\nshame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded. Besides, I was out of\npractice in talking to him: his reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness\nwas congealed beneath it. He had not kept his promise of treating me like his\nsisters; he continually made little chilling differences between us, which did\nnot at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was\nacknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the\ndistance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the\nvillage schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to\nhis confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present frigidity.\n \nSuch being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his head\nsuddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said\u2014\n \n\u201cYou see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.\u201d\n \nStartled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment\u2019s\nhesitation I answered\u2014\n \n\u201cBut are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose\ntriumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?\u201d\n \n\u201cI think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called\nupon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is decisive: my way\nis now clear; I thank God for it!\u201d So saying, he returned to his papers and his\nsilence.\n \nAs our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana\u2019s, Mary\u2019s, and mine) settled into a\nquieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St.\nJohn stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours\ntogether. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclop\u00e6dic reading\nshe had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he\npondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition\nof which he thought necessary to his plans.\n \nThus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed\nenough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking\ngrammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students,\nwith a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly\nwithdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table. I wondered\nwhat it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to\nexhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly\nvisit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was\nunfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged\nme not to go, he would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage\nme to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.\n \n\u201cJane is not such a weakling as you would make her,\u201d he would say: \u201cshe can\nbear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of\nus. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;\u2014better calculated to endure\nvariations of climate than many more robust.\u201d\n \nAnd when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little\nweather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be\nto vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse was a special\nannoyance.\n \nOne afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a\ncold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he,\ndeciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged a translation for an\nexercise, I happened to look his way: there I found myself under the influence\nof the ever-watchful blue eye. How long it had been searching me through and\nthrough, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I\nfelt for the moment superstitious\u2014as if I were sitting in the room with\nsomething uncanny.\n \n\u201cJane, what are you doing?\u201d\n \n\u201cLearning German.\u201d\n \n\u201cI want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are not in earnest?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.\u201d\n \nHe then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was himself at\npresent studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget the commencement;\nthat it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with whom he might again and\nagain go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his mind; that his\nchoice had hovered for some time between me and his sisters; but that he had\nfixed on me because he saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three.\nWould I do him this favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice\nlong, as it wanted now barely three months to his departure.\n \nSt. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression\nmade on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent. I\nconsented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her scholar\ntransferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both she and Mary agreed\nthat St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step. He answered\nquietly\u2014\n \n\u201cI know it.\u201d\n \nI found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he\nexpected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations, he, in\nhis own way, fully testified his approbation. By degrees, he acquired a certain\ninfluence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his praise and notice were\nmore restraining than his indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely\nwhen he was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that\nvivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that\nonly serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every\neffort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing\nspell. When he said \u201cgo,\u201d I went; \u201ccome,\u201d I came; \u201cdo this,\u201d I did it. But I\ndid not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect\nme.\n \nOne evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding him\ngood-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was equally his\ncustom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour\n(she was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way,\nwas as strong), exclaimed\u2014\n \n\u201cSt. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don\u2019t treat her as\nsuch: you should kiss her too.\u201d\n \nShe pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt\nuncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John\nbent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes\nquestioned my eyes piercingly\u2014he kissed me. There are no such things as marble\nkisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin\u2019s salute\nbelonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his\nwas an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was\nnot striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little\npale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never\nomitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I\nunderwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\n \nAs for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more\nand more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my\ntastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for\nwhich I had no natural vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could\nnever reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The\nthing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and\nclassic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and\nsolemn lustre of his own.\n \nNot his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of late it had\nbeen easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and\ndrained my happiness at its source\u2014the evil of suspense.\n \nPerhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes\nof place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with me, because it\nwas not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could\nwash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the\nmarble it inscribed. The craving to know what had become of him followed me\neverywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to\nthink of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood\nover it.\n \nIn the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I\nhad inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester\u2019s present residence and state\nof health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was quite ignorant of all\nconcerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the\nsubject. I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt\nsure it would elicit an early answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed\nwithout reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post\narrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\n \nI wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed. Renewed\nhope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then,\nlike it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me. When half a\nyear wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.\n \nA fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer approached; Diana\ntried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the\nsea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted\nemployment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I\nsuppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my\nlessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment:\nand I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him\u2014I could not resist him.\n \nOne day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was\noccasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me in the\nmorning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost\ncertain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found\nonly an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business. The bitter check had\nwrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters\nand flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.\n \nSt. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice\nfailed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only occupants of the\nparlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was\ngardening\u2014it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy. My companion\nexpressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me as to its cause;\nhe only said\u2014\n \n\u201cWe will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.\u201d And while I\nsmothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient, leaning on his\ndesk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected\nand fully understood crisis in a patient\u2019s malady. Having stifled my sobs,\nwiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I\nresumed my task, and succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and\nhis, locked his desk, and said\u2014\n \n\u201cNow, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will call Diana and Mary.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put on your\nthings; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh\nGlen: I will join you in a moment.\u201d\n \nI know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with\npositive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission\nand determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the\nvery moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and\nas neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to\nmutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John\u2019s directions; and in ten\nminutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.\n \nThe breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of\nheath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the\nravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear,\ncatching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament. As\nwe advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald\ngreen, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a\nstar-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen,\ntowards its head, wound to their very core.\n \n\u201cLet us rest here,\u201d said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a\nbattalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down\na waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and\nflower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem\u2014where it exaggerated the\nwild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning\u2014where it guarded\nthe forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.\n \nI took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down the\nhollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the\nunclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his\nhair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt:\nwith his eye he bade farewell to something.\n \n\u201cAnd I shall see it again,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cin dreams when I sleep by the\nGanges: and again in a more remote hour\u2014when another slumber overcomes me\u2014on\nthe shore of a darker stream!\u201d\n \nStrange words of a strange love! An austere patriot\u2019s passion for his\nfatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor\nI to him: that interval past, he recommenced\u2014\n \n\u201cJane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails\non the 20th of June.\u201d\n \n\u201cGod will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,\u201d I answered.\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cthere is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an infallible\nMaster. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws\nand erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain,\nis the All-perfect. It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to\nenlist under the same banner,\u2014to join in the same enterprise.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to\nmarch with the strong.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are\nworthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThose are few in number, and difficult to discover.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up\u2014to urge and exhort\nthem to the effort\u2014to show them what their gifts are, and why they were\ngiven\u2014to speak Heaven\u2019s message in their ear,\u2014to offer them, direct from God, a\nplace in the ranks of His chosen.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the\nfirst to inform them of it?\u201d\n \nI felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled\nto hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.\n \n\u201cAnd what does your heart say?\u201d demanded St. John.\n \n\u201cMy heart is mute,\u2014my heart is mute,\u201d I answered, struck and thrilled.\n \n\u201cThen I must speak for it,\u201d continued the deep, relentless voice. \u201cJane, come\nwith me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.\u201d\n \nThe glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard a\nsummons from Heaven\u2014as if a visionary messenger, like him of Macedonia, had\nenounced, \u201cCome over and help us!\u201d But I was no apostle,\u2014I could not behold the\nherald,\u2014I could not receive his call.\n \n\u201cOh, St. John!\u201d I cried, \u201chave some mercy!\u201d\n \nI appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty, knew\nneither mercy nor remorse. He continued\u2014\n \n\u201cGod and nature intended you for a missionary\u2019s wife. It is not personal, but\nmental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.\nA missionary\u2019s wife you must\u2014shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you\u2014not for\nmy pleasure, but for my Sovereign\u2019s service.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am not fit for it: I have no vocation,\u201d I said.\n \nHe had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by them.\nIndeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his arms on his\nchest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying\nopposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him to its\nclose\u2014resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him.\n \n\u201cHumility, Jane,\u201d said he, \u201cis the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say\nright that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever\nwas truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am\nbut dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of\nsinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me. I\nknow my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a\nfeeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores\nof His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like\nme, Jane\u2014trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not\ndoubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary\nlabours.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your\ntask from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.\nThis I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as\nstrong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut my powers\u2014where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them. Nothing\nspeaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light kindling\u2014no\nlife quickening\u2014no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I wish I could make you\nsee how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one\nshrinking fear fettered in its depths\u2014the fear of being persuaded by you to\nattempt what I cannot accomplish!\u201d\n \n\u201cI have an answer for you\u2014hear it. I have watched you ever since we first met:\nI have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you in that time by\nsundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the village school I found\nyou could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your\nhabits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you\ncould win while you controlled. In the calm with which you learnt you had\nbecome suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:\u2014lucre had no\nundue power over you. In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth\ninto four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three\nothers to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in\nthe flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which, at my\nwish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another\nbecause it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since\npersevered in it\u2014in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you\nhave met its difficulties\u2014I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.\nJane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and\ncourageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself\u2014I can\ntrust you unreservedly. As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper\namongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.\u201d\n \nMy iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step.\nShut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way,\nwhich had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My work, which had appeared\nso vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he proceeded, and assumed\na definite form under his shaping hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a\nquarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.\n \n\u201cVery willingly,\u201d he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up the\npass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.\n \n\u201cI can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge\nthat,\u201d I meditated,\u2014\u201cthat is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is not the\nexistence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then? He does not\ncare for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity\nand sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is very plain before me. In\nleaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land\u2014Mr. Rochester is not\nthere; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me? My business is to\nlive without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day,\nas if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might\nreunite me to him. Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another\ninterest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers\nme truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble\ncares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by\nuptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say, Yes\u2014and yet I\nshudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I\ngo to premature death. And how will the interval between leaving England for\nIndia, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well! That, too, is very\nclear to my vision. By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I\nshall satisfy him\u2014to the finest central point and farthest outward\ncircle of his expectations. If I do go with him\u2014if I do make the\nsacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the\naltar\u2014heart, vitals, the entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall\napprove me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has\nnever suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little\ngrudging.\n \n\u201cConsent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item\u2014one dreadful item.\nIt is\u2014that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband\u2019s heart for\nme than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in\nyonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.\nUnmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his\ncalculations\u2014coolly put into practice his plans\u2014go through the wedding\nceremony? Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love\n(which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was\nquite absent? Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is\na sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I will\nnever undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him\u2014not as his wife: I will\ntell him so.\u201d\n \nI looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column; his face\nturned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to his feet and\napproached me.\n \n\u201cI am ready to go to India, if I may go free.\u201d\n \n\u201cYour answer requires a commentary,\u201d he said; \u201cit is not clear.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have hitherto been my adopted brother\u2014I, your adopted sister: let us\ncontinue as such: you and I had better not marry.\u201d\n \nHe shook his head. \u201cAdopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you were my\nreal sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife. But as\nit is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it\ncannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan. Do you\nnot see it, Jane? Consider a moment\u2014your strong sense will guide you.\u201d\n \nI did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the\nfact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it\ninferred we ought not to marry. I said so. \u201cSt. John,\u201d I returned, \u201cI regard\nyou as a brother\u2014you, me as a sister: so let us continue.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe cannot\u2014we cannot,\u201d he answered, with short, sharp determination: \u201cit would\nnot do. You have said you will go with me to India: remember\u2014you have said\nthat.\u201d\n \n\u201cConditionally.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell\u2014well. To the main point\u2014the departure with me from England, the\nco-operation with me in my future labours\u2014you do not object. You have already\nas good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it.\nYou have but one end to keep in view\u2014how the work you have undertaken can best\nbe done. Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims;\nmerge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect\u2014with\npower\u2014the mission of your great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor:\nnot a brother\u2014that is a loose tie\u2014but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister:\na sister might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can\ninfluence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.\u201d\n \nI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow\u2014his hold on my\nlimbs.\n \n\u201cSeek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.\u201d\n \n\u201cOne fitted to my purpose, you mean\u2014fitted to my vocation. Again I tell you it\nis not the insignificant private individual\u2014the mere man, with the man\u2019s\nselfish senses\u2014I wish to mate: it is the missionary.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I will give the missionary my energies\u2014it is all he wants\u2014but not myself:\nthat would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For them he has no\nuse: I retain them.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou cannot\u2014you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half an\noblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I\nadvocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept on His behalf\na divided allegiance: it must be entire.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! I will give my heart to God,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not want it.\u201d\n \nI will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm\nboth in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that\naccompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not\nunderstood him. He had held me in awe, because he had held me in doubt. How\nmuch of him was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but\nrevelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of his nature was\nproceeding before my eyes. I saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I\nunderstood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that\nhandsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell\nfrom his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these\nqualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal\u2014one\nwith whom I might argue\u2014one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\n \nHe was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an\nupward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern\nsurprise and keen inquiry. \u201cIs she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!\u201d it\nseemed to say. \u201cWhat does this signify?\u201d\n \n\u201cDo not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,\u201d he said ere long; \u201cone of\nwhich we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I trust, Jane, you are\nin earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want.\nOnce wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of\nthat Maker\u2019s spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and\nendeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end. You will\nsee what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and\nmental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent\nconformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all\nminor caprices\u2014all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling\u2014all scruple\nabout the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination\u2014you\nwill hasten to enter into that union at once.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall I?\u201d I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in their\nharmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his brow,\ncommanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never\nsoft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his wife.\nOh! it would never do! As his curate, his comrade, all would be right: I would\ncross oceans with him in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian\ndeserts with him in that office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion\nand vigour; accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his\nineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly\nesteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should suffer often, no doubt,\nattached to him only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a\nstringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free. I should still have my\nunblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to\ncommunicate in moments of loneliness. There would be recesses in my mind which\nwould be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh\nand sheltered which his austerity could never blight, nor his measured\nwarrior-march trample down: but as his wife\u2014at his side always, and always\nrestrained, and always checked\u2014forced to keep the fire of my nature continually\nlow, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned\nflame consumed vital after vital\u2014this would be unendurable.\n \n\u201cSt. John!\u201d I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d he answered icily.\n \n\u201cI repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as\nyour wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.\u201d\n \n\u201cA part of me you must become,\u201d he answered steadily; \u201cotherwise the whole\nbargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a\ngirl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we be for ever\ntogether\u2014sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes\u2014and unwed?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said shortly; \u201cunder the circumstances, quite as well as if I\nwere either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to\nattempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both. And for the\nrest, though you have a man\u2019s vigorous brain, you have a woman\u2019s heart and\u2014it\nwould not do.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would do,\u201d I affirmed with some disdain, \u201cperfectly well. I have a woman\u2019s\nheart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade\u2019s\nconstancy; a fellow-soldier\u2019s frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a\nneophyte\u2019s respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more\u2014don\u2019t fear.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is what I want,\u201d he said, speaking to himself; \u201cit is just what I want. And\nthere are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane, you would not\nrepent marrying me\u2014be certain of that; we must be married. I repeat it:\nthere is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon\nmarriage to render the union right even in your eyes.\u201d\n \n\u201cI scorn your idea of love,\u201d I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood\nbefore him, leaning my back against the rock. \u201cI scorn the counterfeit\nsentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.\u201d\n \nHe looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so. Whether\nhe was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he could\ncommand his countenance thoroughly.\n \n\u201cI scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,\u201d he said: \u201cI think I\nhave done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.\u201d\n \nI was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.\n \n\u201cForgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been\nroused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on which our\nnatures are at variance\u2014a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love\nis an apple of discord between us. If the reality were required, what should we\ndo? How should we feel? My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage\u2014forget\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d said he; \u201cit is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can\nsecure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present. To-morrow, I\nleave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to\nsay farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight\u2014take that space of time to consider\nmy offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but\nGod. Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you\nenter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track\nof selfish ease and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be\nnumbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!\u201d\n \nHe had done. Turning from me, he once more\n \n\u201cLooked to river, looked to hill.\u201d\n \nBut this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy to hear\nthem uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in his iron silence\nall he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature,\nwhich has met resistance where it expected submission\u2014the disapprobation of a\ncool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in\nwhich it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished\nto coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so\npatiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and\nrepentance.\n \nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget even\nto shake hands with me, but left the room in silence. I\u2014who, though I had no\nlove, had much friendship for him\u2014was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt\nthat tears started to my eyes.\n \n\u201cI see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,\u201d said Diana, \u201cduring your\nwalk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage\nexpecting you\u2014he will make it up.\u201d\n \nI have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy\nthan dignified; and I ran after him\u2014he stood at the foot of the stairs.\n \n\u201cGood-night, St. John,\u201d said I.\n \n\u201cGood-night, Jane,\u201d he replied calmly.\n \n\u201cThen shake hands,\u201d I added.\n \nWhat a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply displeased\nby what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him.\nNo happy reconciliation was to be had with him\u2014no cheering smile or generous\nword: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked him if\nhe forgave me, he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the\nremembrance of vexation; that he had nothing to forgive, not having been\noffended.\n \nAnd with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me down.\n",
        "\nHe did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would. He\ndeferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel what\nsevere punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can\ninflict on one who has offended him. Without one overt act of hostility, one\nupbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I\nwas put beyond the pale of his favour.\n \nNot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness\u2014not that he\nwould have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his power to do\nso. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the mean gratification of\nvengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned him and his love, but he had\nnot forgotten the words; and as long as he and I lived he never would forget\nthem. I saw by his look, when he turned to me, that they were always written on\nthe air between me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his\near, and their echo toned every answer he gave me.\n \nHe did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual each\nmorning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him had a\npleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with\nwhat skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual,\nextract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval\nwhich had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his language and\nmanner. To me, he was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye\nwas a cold, bright, blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument\u2014nothing more.\n \nAll this was torture to me\u2014refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire\nof indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me\naltogether. I felt how\u2014if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep\nsunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop\nof blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of\ncrime. Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No\nruth met my ruth. He experienced no suffering from estrangement\u2014no\nyearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling\ntears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect\non him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal. To his\nsisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere\ncoldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and\nbanned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he did not by\nmalice, but on principle.\n \nThe night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden about\nsunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man, alienated as he now\nwas, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to\nmake a last attempt to regain his friendship. I went out and approached him as\nhe stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.\n \n\u201cSt. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be\nfriends.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope we are friends,\u201d was the unmoved reply; while he still watched the\nrising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.\n \n\u201cNo, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all good.\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one\nill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection\nthan that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cYour wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you\nas a stranger.\u201d\n \nThis, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough. Had\nI attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left\nhim; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could. I\ndeeply venerated my cousin\u2019s talent and principle. His friendship was of value\nto me: to lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt\nto reconquer it.\n \n\u201cMust we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you leave\nme so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?\u201d\n \nHe now turned quite from the moon and faced me.\n \n\u201cWhen I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to India?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou said I could not unless I married you.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?\u201d\n \nReader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the\nice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their\nanger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?\n \n\u201cNo. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution.\u201d\n \nThe avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash\ndown.\n \n\u201cOnce more, why this refusal?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cFormerly,\u201d I answered, \u201cbecause you did not love me; now, I reply, because you\nalmost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me\nnow.\u201d\n \nHis lips and cheeks turned white\u2014quite white.\n \n\u201cI should kill you\u2014I am killing you? Your words are such as ought\nnot to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an unfortunate\nstate of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that\nit is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven\ntimes.\u201d\n \nI had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from his mind\nthe trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another\nand far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.\n \n\u201cNow you will indeed hate me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is useless to attempt to conciliate\nyou: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.\u201d\n \nA fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the\ntruth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire\nI had whetted. I was heart-wrung.\n \n\u201cYou utterly misinterpret my words,\u201d I said, at once seizing his hand: \u201cI have\nno intention to grieve or pain you\u2014indeed, I have not.\u201d\n \nMost bitterly he smiled\u2014most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine. \u201cAnd now\nyou recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?\u201d said he,\nafter a considerable pause.\n \n\u201cYes, I will, as your assistant,\u201d I answered.\n \nA very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between Nature\nand Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in\nhis eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He spoke at last.\n \n\u201cI before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing\nto accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you in such terms as,\nI should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the\nplan. That you have done so, I regret\u2014for your sake.\u201d\n \nI interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once.\n\u201cKeep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You pretend to be\nshocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked: for, with your\nsuperior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand\nmy meaning. I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your\nwife.\u201d\n \nAgain he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion perfectly.\nHe answered emphatically but calmly\u2014\n \n\u201cA female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me, then, it\nseems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in\ntown, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor. Your own\nfortune will make you independent of the Society\u2019s aid; and thus you may still\nbe spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you\nengaged to join.\u201d\n \nNow I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or\nentered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much\ntoo despotic for the occasion. I replied\u2014\n \n\u201cThere is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case. I am\nnot under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.\nWith you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a\nsister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I\nshould not live long in that climate.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! you are afraid of yourself,\u201d he said, curling his lip.\n \n\u201cI am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me\nwould, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover,\nbefore I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain\nwhether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I\nhave long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that\ndoubt is removed.\u201d\n \n\u201cI know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you cherish\nis lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you\nshould blush to allude to it. You think of Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \nIt was true. I confessed it by silence.\n \n\u201cAre you going to seek Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \n\u201cI must find out what is become of him.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt remains for me, then,\u201d he said, \u201cto remember you in my prayers, and to\nentreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a\ncastaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen. But God sees not\nas man sees: His will be done\u2014\u201d\n \nHe opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen. He was\nsoon out of sight.\n \nOn re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very\nthoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand on my\nshoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.\n \n\u201cJane,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are always agitated and pale now. I am sure there is\nsomething the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands. I\nhave watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such\na spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what. St. John is a\nstrange being\u2014\u201d\n \nShe paused\u2014I did not speak: soon she resumed\u2014\n \n\u201cThat brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I\nam sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed\nto any one else\u2014to what end? I wish he loved you\u2014does he, Jane?\u201d\n \nI put her cool hand to my hot forehead; \u201cNo, Die, not one whit.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone\nwith him, and keep you so continually at his side? Mary and I had both\nconcluded he wished you to marry him.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe does\u2014he has asked me to be his wife.\u201d\n \nDiana clapped her hands. \u201cThat is just what we hoped and thought! And you will\nmarry him, Jane, won\u2019t you? And then he will stay in England.\u201d\n \n\u201cFar from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting\nfellow-labourer in his Indian toils.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! He wishes you to go to India?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cMadness!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou would not live three months there, I am certain.\nYou never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have refused to marry him\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd have consequently displeased him?\u201d she suggested.\n \n\u201cDeeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as\nhis sister.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook\u2014one of\nincessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak. St.\nJohn\u2014you know him\u2014would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no\npermission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed,\nwhatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found\ncourage to refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot as a husband.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet he is a handsome fellow.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.\u201d\n \n\u201cPlain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be\ngrilled alive in Calcutta.\u201d And again she earnestly conjured me to give up all\nthoughts of going out with her brother.\n \n\u201cI must indeed,\u201d I said; \u201cfor when just now I repeated the offer of serving him\nfor a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency. He seemed to\nthink I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried:\nas if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually\nregarded him as such.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat makes you say he does not love you, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again explained that\nit is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He has told me I am formed\nfor labour\u2014not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am\nnot formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage. Would it not\nbe strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a\nuseful tool?\u201d\n \n\u201cInsupportable\u2014unnatural\u2014out of the question!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd then,\u201d I continued, \u201cthough I have only sisterly affection for him now,\nyet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an\ninevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented;\nand there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and\nconversation. In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. He would\nnot want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible\nthat it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he\nwould.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd yet St. John is a good man,\u201d said Diana.\n \n\u201cHe is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and\nclaims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better,\ntherefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress,\nhe should trample them down. Here he comes! I will leave you, Diana.\u201d And I\nhastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.\n \nBut I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he appeared just\nas composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak to me, and I was\ncertain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial scheme: the sequel\nshowed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed me precisely in his ordinary\nmanner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary manner\u2014one scrupulously polite.\nNo doubt he had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had\nroused in him, and now believed he had forgiven me once more.\n \nFor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first chapter of\nRevelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his lips fell the\nwords of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at once so sweet and\nfull\u2014never did his manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when\nhe delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn\ntone\u2014that manner a more thrilling meaning\u2014as he sat in the midst of his\nhousehold circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and\nrendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat\nthere, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision\nof the new heaven and the new earth\u2014told how God would come to dwell with men,\nhow He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there\nshould be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because\nthe former things were passed away.\n \nThe succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially as I\nfelt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them,\nhis eye had turned on me.\n \n\u201cHe that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he\nshall be my son. But,\u201d was slowly, distinctly read, \u201cthe fearful, the\nunbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire\nand brimstone, which is the second death.\u201d\n \nHenceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\n \nA calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his\nenunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader believed\nhis name was already written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life, and he yearned after\nthe hour which should admit him to the city to which the kings of the earth\nbring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it,\nbecause the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.\n \nIn the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered\u2014all his stern zeal\nwoke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest.\nHe supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the\nfold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of\nthe world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged,\nhe claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever\ndeeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then,\nwhen it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the\ngreatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead\nfor it, could not but feel it too.\n \nThe prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour in the\nmorning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room\u2014in compliance, I\nthink, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand, and wished him a\npleasant journey.\n \n\u201cThank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that\nspace, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I listened to human pride, I\nshould say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and\nkeep steadily in view my first aim\u2014to do all things to the glory of God. My\nMaster was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a\nvessel of wrath: repent\u2014resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid\nto work while it is day\u2014warned that \u2018the night cometh when no man shall work.\u2019\nRemember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God give you\nstrength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!\u201d\n \nHe laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken\nearnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his\nmistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep\u2014or better,\nof a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is responsible. All men of\ntalent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or\naspirants, or despots\u2014provided only they be sincere\u2014have their sublime moments,\nwhen they subdue and rule. I felt veneration for St. John\u2014veneration so strong\nthat its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was\ntempted to cease struggling with him\u2014to rush down the torrent of his will into\nthe gulf of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by\nhim now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I was a fool\nboth times. To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have\nyielded now would have been an error of judgment. So I think at this hour, when\nI look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious\nof folly at the instant.\n \nI stood motionless under my hierophant\u2019s touch. My refusals were forgotten\u2014my\nfears overcome\u2014my wrestlings paralysed. The Impossible\u2014i.e., my marriage\nwith St. John\u2014was fast becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly with a\nsudden sweep. Religion called\u2014Angels beckoned\u2014God commanded\u2014life rolled\ntogether like a scroll\u2014death\u2019s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it\nseemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a\nsecond. The dim room was full of visions.\n \n\u201cCould you decide now?\u201d asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle\ntones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is\nit than force! I could resist St. John\u2019s wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under\nhis kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less\nbe made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion. His nature was not changed\nby one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated.\n \n\u201cI could decide if I were but certain,\u201d I answered: \u201cwere I but convinced that\nit is God\u2019s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now\u2014come\nafterwards what would!\u201d\n \n\u201cMy prayers are heard!\u201d ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer on my\nhead, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if\nhe loved me (I say almost\u2014I knew the difference\u2014for I had felt what it\nwas to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the question, and\nthought only of duty). I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before\nwhich clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was\nright; and only that. \u201cShow me, show me the path!\u201d I entreated of Heaven. I was\nexcited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of\nexcitement the reader shall judge.\n \nAll the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were\nnow retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was full of\nmoonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb. Suddenly it stood\nstill to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once\nto my head and extremities. The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it\nwas quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their\nutmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned\nand forced to wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh\nquivered on my bones.\n \n\u201cWhat have you heard? What do you see?\u201d asked St. John. I saw nothing, but I\nheard a voice somewhere cry\u2014\n \n\u201cJane! Jane! Jane!\u201d\u2014nothing more.\n \n\u201cO God! what is it?\u201d I gasped.\n \nI might have said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d for it did not seem in the room\u2014nor in the\nhouse\u2014nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air\u2014nor from under the\nearth\u2014nor from overhead. I had heard it\u2014where, or whence, for ever impossible\nto know! And it was the voice of a human being\u2014a known, loved, well-remembered\nvoice\u2014that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly,\neerily, urgently.\n \n\u201cI am coming!\u201d I cried. \u201cWait for me! Oh, I will come!\u201d I flew to the door and\nlooked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the garden: it was void.\n \n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I exclaimed.\n \nThe hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back\u2014\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I\nlistened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and\nmidnight hush.\n \n\u201cDown superstition!\u201d I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black\nyew at the gate. \u201cThis is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work\nof nature. She was roused, and did\u2014no miracle\u2014but her best.\u201d\n \nI broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It was\nmy time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and in\nforce. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I\nmust and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy to command\nwell enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in;\nfell on my knees; and prayed in my way\u2014a different way to St. John\u2019s, but\neffective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit;\nand my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the\nthanksgiving\u2014took a resolve\u2014and lay down, unscared, enlightened\u2014eager but for\nthe daylight.\n",
        "\nThe daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two with\narranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein\nI should wish to leave them during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John\nquit his room. He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock\u2014no, but a slip of\npaper was passed under the door. I took it up. It bore these words\u2014\n \n\u201cYou left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little longer, you\nwould have laid your hand on the Christian\u2019s cross and the angel\u2019s crown. I\nshall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight. Meantime,\nwatch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is\nwilling, but the flesh, I see, is weak. I shall pray for you hourly.\u2014Yours,\nST. JOHN.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy spirit,\u201d I answered mentally, \u201cis willing to do what is right; and my\nflesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once\nthat will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be strong enough to\nsearch\u2014inquire\u2014to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open\nday of certainty.\u201d\n \nIt was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat\nfast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass out.\nLooking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He took the way over\nthe misty moors in the direction of Whitcross\u2014there he would meet the coach.\n \n\u201cIn a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,\u201d thought I: \u201cI\ntoo have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to see and ask after in\nEngland, before I depart for ever.\u201d\n \nIt wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking\nsoftly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans\ntheir present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I\ncould recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I\nhad heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in\nme\u2014not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression\u2014a\ndelusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The\nwondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\nfoundations of Paul and Silas\u2019s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul\u2019s\ncell and loosed its bands\u2014it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang\ntrembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear,\nand in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook,\nbut exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged\nto make, independent of the cumbrous body.\n \n\u201cEre many days,\u201d I said, as I terminated my musings, \u201cI will know something of\nhim whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no\navail\u2014personal inquiry shall replace them.\u201d\n \nAt breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and\nshould be absent at least four days.\n \n\u201cAlone, Jane?\u201d they asked.\n \n\u201cYes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time\nbeen uneasy.\u201d\n \nThey might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had believed\nme to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so; but,\nwith their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment, except that\nDiana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale,\nshe observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I\nhoped soon to alleviate.\n \nIt was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no\ninquiries\u2014no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not now be\nexplicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with\nwhich I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free action I should\nunder similar circumstances have accorded them.\n \nI left Moor House at three o\u2019clock P.M., and soon after four I\nstood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the\ncoach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of those\nsolitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. It\nwas the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on\nthis very spot\u2014how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I\nbeckoned. I entered\u2014not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price\nof its accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the\nmessenger-pigeon flying home.\n \nIt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a\nTuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach\nstopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery\nwhose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature\nand verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met\nmy eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character\nof this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.\n \n\u201cHow far is Thornfield Hall from here?\u201d I asked of the ostler.\n \n\u201cJust two miles, ma\u2019am, across the fields.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy journey is closed,\u201d I thought to myself. I got out of the coach, gave a box\nI had into the ostler\u2019s charge, to be kept till I called for it; paid my fare;\nsatisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign\nof the inn, and I read in gilt letters, \u201cThe Rochester Arms.\u201d My heart leapt\nup: I was already on my master\u2019s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck\nit:\u2014\n \n\u201cYour master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and\nthen, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is\nthere? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not\nspeak to him or seek his presence. You have lost your labour\u2014you had better go\nno farther,\u201d urged the monitor. \u201cAsk information of the people at the inn; they\ncan give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that\nman, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.\u201d\n \nThe suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on it. I\nso dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong doubt was to\nprolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her star.\nThere was the stile before me\u2014the very fields through which I had hurried,\nblind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on\nthe morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved\nto take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes!\nHow I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what\nfeelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and\nhill between them!\n \nAt last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the\nmorning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. Another field\ncrossed\u2014a lane threaded\u2014and there were the courtyard walls\u2014the back offices:\nthe house itself, the rookery still hid. \u201cMy first view of it shall be in\nfront,\u201d I determined, \u201cwhere its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at\nonce, and where I can single out my master\u2019s very window: perhaps he will be\nstanding at it\u2014he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on\nthe pavement in front. Could I but see him!\u2014but a moment! Surely, in that case,\nI should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell\u2014I am not certain. And if\nI did\u2014what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more\ntasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps at this moment he is\nwatching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.\u201d\n \nI had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard\u2014turned its angle: there was a\ngate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by\nstone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full\nfront of the mansion. I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain\nif any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long\nfront\u2014all from this sheltered station were at my command.\n \nThe crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey. I\nwonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very careful and\ntimid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and\nthen a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into\nthe meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a\nprotracted, hardy gaze towards it. \u201cWhat affectation of diffidence was this at\nfirst?\u201d they might have demanded; \u201cwhat stupid regardlessness now?\u201d\n \nHear an illustration, reader.\n \nA lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse\nof her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the grass, careful\nto make no sound; he pauses\u2014fancying she has stirred: he withdraws: not for\nworlds would he be seen. All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a\nlight veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes\nanticipate the vision of beauty\u2014warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How\nhurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he\nsuddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment\nsince, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,\nand gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no\nlonger fears to waken by any sound he can utter\u2014by any movement he can make. He\nthought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.\n \nI looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.\n \nNo need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!\u2014to peep up at chamber lattices,\nfearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for doors opening\u2014to\nfancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The lawn, the grounds were\ntrodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front was, as I had once seen it\nin a dream, but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking,\nperforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys\u2014all had\ncrashed in.\n \nAnd there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome wild.\nNo wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer:\nas well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of\nthe stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen\u2014by conflagration: but how\nkindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and\nmarble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as\nproperty? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer\nit\u2014not even dumb sign, mute token.\n \nIn wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I\ngathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence. Winter snows, I\nthought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those\nhollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had\ncherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and\nfallen rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In\nwhat land? Under what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey\nchurch tower near the gates, and I asked, \u201cIs he with Damer de Rochester,\nsharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?\u201d\n \nSome answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but at the\ninn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought my breakfast\ninto the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit down: I had some\nquestions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such\nhorror had I of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had\njust left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host was a\nrespectable-looking, middle-aged man.\n \n\u201cYou know Thornfield Hall, of course?\u201d I managed to say at last.\n \n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am; I lived there once.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you?\u201d Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.\n \n\u201cI was the late Mr. Rochester\u2019s butler,\u201d he added.\n \nThe late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been trying\nto evade.\n \n\u201cThe late!\u201d I gasped. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d\n \n\u201cI mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward\u2019s father,\u201d he explained. I breathed\nagain: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words that Mr.\nEdward\u2014my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)\u2014was at least\nalive: was, in short, \u201cthe present gentleman.\u201d Gladdening words! It seemed I\ncould hear all that was to come\u2014whatever the disclosures might be\u2014with\ncomparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I\nthought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes.\n \n\u201cIs Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?\u201d I asked, knowing, of course,\nwhat the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as\nto where he really was.\n \n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am\u2014oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in\nthese parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,\u2014Thornfield Hall\nis quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful\ncalamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any\nof the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and\nbefore the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.\nIt was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt dead of night!\u201d I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at\nThornfield. \u201cWas it known how it originated?\u201d I demanded.\n \n\u201cThey guessed, ma\u2019am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained\nbeyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,\u201d he continued, edging his chair a\nlittle nearer the table, and speaking low, \u201cthat there was a lady\u2014a\u2014a lunatic,\nkept in the house?\u201d\n \n\u201cI have heard something of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cShe was kept in very close confinement, ma\u2019am; people even for some years was\nnot absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they only knew by\nrumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was\ndifficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and\nsome believed she had been his mistress. But a queer thing happened a year\nsince\u2014a very queer thing.\u201d\n \nI feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the main\nfact.\n \n\u201cAnd this lady?\u201d\n \n\u201cThis lady, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered, \u201cturned out to be Mr. Rochester\u2019s wife! The\ndiscovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a\ngoverness at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cBut the fire,\u201d I suggested.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m coming to that, ma\u2019am\u2014that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say\nthey never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually.\nThey used to watch him\u2014servants will, you know, ma\u2019am\u2014and he set store on her\npast everything: for all, nobody but him thought her so very handsome. She was\na little small thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her myself;\nbut I\u2019ve heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough.\nMr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when\ngentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they\nwere bewitched. Well, he would marry her.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou shall tell me this part of the story another time,\u201d I said; \u201cbut now I\nhave a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire. Was it\nsuspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ve hit it, ma\u2019am: it\u2019s quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her,\nthat set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole\u2014an\nable woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault\u2014a fault common\nto a deal of them nurses and matrons\u2014she kept a private bottle of gin by\nher, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for she had a\nhard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast\nasleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch,\nwould take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go\nroaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They\nsay she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don\u2019t know about\nthat. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room\nnext her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the\nchamber that had been the governess\u2019s\u2014(she was like as if she knew somehow how\nmatters had gone on, and had a spite at her)\u2014and she kindled the bed there; but\nthere was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately. The governess had run away two\nmonths before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most\nprecious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he\ngrew savage\u2014quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he\ngot dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent Mrs. Fairfax,\nthe housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely,\nfor he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it\u2014she was a very\ngood woman. Miss Ad\u00e8le, a ward he had, was put to school. He broke off\nacquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the\nHall.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! did he not leave England?\u201d\n \n\u201cLeave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of the house,\nexcept at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the\norchard as if he had lost his senses\u2014which it is my opinion he had; for a more\nspirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess\ncrossed him, you never saw, ma\u2019am. He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or\nracing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and\na will of his own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my\npart, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she\ncame to Thornfield Hall.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above\nand below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself,\nand went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And then they called out to\nhim that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above\nthe battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw\nher and heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black\nhair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed,\nand several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to\nthe roof; we heard him call \u2018Bertha!\u2019 We saw him approach her; and then, ma\u2019am,\nshe yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the\npavement.\u201d\n \n\u201cDead?\u201d\n \n\u201cDead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were scattered.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood God!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may well say so, ma\u2019am: it was frightful!\u201d\n \nHe shuddered.\n \n\u201cAnd afterwards?\u201d I urged.\n \n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some\nbits of walls standing now.\u201d\n \n\u201cWere any other lives lost?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo\u2014perhaps it would have been better if there had.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cPoor Mr. Edward!\u201d he ejaculated, \u201cI little thought ever to have seen it! Some\nsay it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and\nwanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my\npart.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou said he was alive?\u201d I exclaimed.\n \n\u201cYes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy? How?\u201d My blood was again running cold. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIs he\nin England?\u201d\n \n\u201cAy\u2014ay\u2014he\u2019s in England; he can\u2019t get out of England, I fancy\u2014he\u2019s a fixture\nnow.\u201d\n \nWhat agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.\n \n\u201cHe is stone-blind,\u201d he said at last. \u201cYes, he is stone-blind, is Mr. Edward.\u201d\n \nI had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to ask what\nhad caused this calamity.\n \n\u201cIt was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way, ma\u2019am:\nhe wouldn\u2019t leave the house till every one else was out before him. As he came\ndown the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from\nthe battlements, there was a great crash\u2014all fell. He was taken out from under\nthe ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect\nhim partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr.\nCarter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he\nlost the sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed\u2014blind and a cripple.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere is he? Where does he now live?\u201d\n \n\u201cAt Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off: quite a\ndesolate spot.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho is with him?\u201d\n \n\u201cOld John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken down, they\nsay.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you any sort of conveyance?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe have a chaise, ma\u2019am, a very handsome chaise.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to Ferndean\nbefore dark this day, I\u2019ll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually\ndemand.\u201d\n",
        "\nThe manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate\nsize, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood. I had heard of\nit before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His\nfather had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers. He would have\nlet the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and\ninsalubrious site. Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the\nexception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the\nsquire when he went there in the season to shoot.\n \nTo this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics\nof sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain. The last mile I\nperformed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double\nremuneration I had promised. Even when within a very short distance of the\nmanor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of\nthe gloomy wood about it. Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to\nenter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of\nclose-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle\nbetween hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it,\nexpecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far\nand farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.\n \nI thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of\nnatural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round in search of\nanother road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense\nsummer foliage\u2014no opening anywhere.\n \nI proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I\nbeheld a railing, then the house\u2014scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable\nfrom the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal,\nfastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which\nthe wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds;\nonly a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame\nof the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows\nwere latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.\nThe whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, \u201cquite a desolate\nspot.\u201d It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the\nforest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.\n \n\u201cCan there be life here?\u201d I asked.\n \nYes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement\u2014that narrow front-door\nwas unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.\n \nIt opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a\nman without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.\nDusk as it was, I had recognised him\u2014it was my master, Edward Fairfax\nRochester, and no other.\n \nI stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him\u2014to examine him,\nmyself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in\nwhich rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in\nrestraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.\n \nHis form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port was\nstill erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or\nsunk: not in one year\u2019s space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be\nquelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his countenance I saw a change:\nthat looked desperate and brooding\u2014that reminded me of some wronged and\nfettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe. The caged\neagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked\nthat sightless Samson.\n \nAnd, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?\u2014if you do, you\nlittle know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I should dare to\ndrop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath\nit: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.\n \nHe descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the\ngrass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if he knew not\nwhich way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and\nwith a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one\nsaw that all to him was void darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left\narm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by\ntouch to gain an idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the\ntrees were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour, folded\nhis arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his\nuncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some quarter.\n \n\u201cWill you take my arm, sir?\u201d he said; \u201cthere is a heavy shower coming on: had\nyou not better go in?\u201d\n \n\u201cLet me alone,\u201d was the answer.\n \nJohn withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk\nabout: vainly,\u2014all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to the house, and,\nre-entering it, closed the door.\n \nI now drew near and knocked: John\u2019s wife opened for me. \u201cMary,\u201d I said, \u201chow\nare you?\u201d\n \nShe started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried \u201cIs it\nreally you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?\u201d I answered by\ntaking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat\nby a good fire. I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which\nhad happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester.\nI asked John to go down to the turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the\nchaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed\nmy bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at\nthe Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect,\nthough difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay. Just\nat this moment the parlour-bell rang.\n \n\u201cWhen you go in,\u201d said I, \u201ctell your master that a person wishes to speak to\nhim, but do not give my name.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think he will see you,\u201d she answered; \u201che refuses everybody.\u201d\n \nWhen she returned, I inquired what he had said.\n \n\u201cYou are to send in your name and your business,\u201d she replied. She then\nproceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together with\ncandles.\n \n\u201cIs that what he rang for?\u201d I asked.\n \n\u201cYes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.\u201d\n \n\u201cGive the tray to me; I will carry it in.\u201d\n \nI took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray shook as\nI held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my ribs loud and\nfast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.\n \nThis parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate;\nand, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned\nmantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room. His old dog, Pilot, lay on\none side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being\ninadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he\njumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked\nthe tray from my hands. I set it on the table; then patted him, and said\nsoftly, \u201cLie down!\u201d Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what the\ncommotion was: but as he saw nothing, he returned and sighed.\n \n\u201cGive me the water, Mary,\u201d he said.\n \nI approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still\nexcited.\n \n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d he inquired.\n \n\u201cDown, Pilot!\u201d I again said. He checked the water on its way to his lips, and\nseemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. \u201cThis is you, Mary, is it\nnot?\u201d\n \n\u201cMary is in the kitchen,\u201d I answered.\n \nHe put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he did\nnot touch me. \u201cWho is this? Who is this?\u201d he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to\nsee with those sightless eyes\u2014unavailing and distressing attempt!\n\u201cAnswer me\u2014speak again!\u201d he ordered, imperiously and aloud.\n \n\u201cWill you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the\nglass,\u201d I said.\n \n\u201cWho is it? What is it? Who speaks?\u201d\n \n\u201cPilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening,\u201d I\nanswered.\n \n\u201cGreat God!\u2014what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo delusion\u2014no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your\nhealth too sound for frenzy.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I\nmust feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever\u2014whoever you\nare\u2014be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!\u201d\n \nHe groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\n \n\u201cHer very fingers!\u201d he cried; \u201cher small, slight fingers! If so there must be\nmore of her.\u201d\n \nThe muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my\nshoulder\u2014neck\u2014waist\u2014I was entwined and gathered to him.\n \n\u201cIs it Jane? What is it? This is her shape\u2014this is her size\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd this her voice,\u201d I added. \u201cShe is all here: her heart, too. God bless you,\nsir! I am glad to be so near you again.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane Eyre!\u2014Jane Eyre,\u201d was all he said.\n \n\u201cMy dear master,\u201d I answered, \u201cI am Jane Eyre: I have found you out\u2014I am come\nback to you.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn truth?\u2014in the flesh? My living Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou touch me, sir,\u2014you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse,\nnor vacant like air, am I?\u201d\n \n\u201cMy living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her features; but\nI cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream; such dreams as I have\nhad at night when I have clasped her once more to my heart, as I do now; and\nkissed her, as thus\u2014and felt that she loved me, and trusted that she would not\nleave me.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich I never will, sir, from this day.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty mockery;\nand I was desolate and abandoned\u2014my life dark, lonely, hopeless\u2014my soul athirst\nand forbidden to drink\u2014my heart famished and never to be fed. Gentle, soft\ndream, nestling in my arms now, you will fly, too, as your sisters have all\nfled before you: but kiss me before you go\u2014embrace me, Jane.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere, sir\u2014and there!\u201d\u2019\n \nI pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes\u2014I swept his hair\nfrom his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to arouse himself: the\nconviction of the reality of all this seized him.\n \n\u201cIt is you\u2014is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are not a\npining outcast amongst strangers?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, sir! I am an independent woman now.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndependent! What do you mean, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cMy uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! this is practical\u2014this is real!\u201d he cried: \u201cI should never dream that.\nBesides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as\nwell as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.\u2014What, Janet!\nAre you an independent woman? A rich woman?\u201d\n \n\u201cQuite rich, sir. If you won\u2019t let me live with you, I can build a house of my\nown close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want\ncompany of an evening.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after\nyou, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?\u201d\n \n\u201cI told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you will stay with me?\u201d\n \n\u201cCertainly\u2014unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your\nhousekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion\u2014to read to you, to\nwalk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you.\nCease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so\nlong as I live.\u201d\n \nHe replied not: he seemed serious\u2014abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened his\nlips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps\nI had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and he, like St. John, saw\nimpropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had indeed made my proposal from the\nidea that he wished and would ask me to be his wife: an expectation, not the\nless certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at\nonce as his own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance\nbecoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong,\nand was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw\nmyself from his arms\u2014but he eagerly snatched me closer.\n \n\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014Jane; you must not go. No\u2014I have touched you, heard you, felt the\ncomfort of your presence\u2014the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot give up\nthese joys. I have little left in myself\u2014I must have you. The world may\nlaugh\u2014may call me absurd, selfish\u2014but it does not signify. My very soul demands\nyou: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes\u2014but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another.\nYou, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair\u2014to wait on\nme as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous\nspirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought\nto suffice for me no doubt. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly\nfeelings for you: do you think so? Come\u2014tell me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you\nthink it better.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young\u2014you must marry one\nday.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t care about being married.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you\ncare\u2014but\u2014a sightless block!\u201d\n \nHe relapsed again into gloom. I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and\ntook fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the\ndifficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from\nmy previous embarrassment. I resumed a livelier vein of conversation.\n \n\u201cIt is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,\u201d said I, parting his thick\nand long uncut locks; \u201cfor I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or\nsomething of that sort. You have a \u2018faux air\u2019 of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields\nabout you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles\u2019 feathers; whether\nyour nails are grown like birds\u2019 claws or not, I have not yet noticed.\u201d\n \n\u201cOn this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,\u201d he said, drawing the mutilated\nlimb from his breast, and showing it to me. \u201cIt is a mere stump\u2014a ghastly\nsight! Don\u2019t you think so, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes\u2014and the scar of fire on\nyour forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well\nfor all this; and making too much of you.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my cicatrised\nvisage.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you? Don\u2019t tell me so\u2014lest I should say something disparaging to your\njudgment. Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the\nhearth swept up. Can you tell when there is a good fire?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; with the right eye I see a glow\u2014a ruddy haze.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you see the candles?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery dimly\u2014each is a luminous cloud.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan you see me?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen do you take supper?\u201d\n \n\u201cI never take supper.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you shall have some to-night. I am hungry: so are you, I daresay, only you\nforget.\u201d\n \nSummoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him,\nlikewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and\nease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time after. There was no\nharassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for with him\nI was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him; all I said or did seemed\neither to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life\nand light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in\nmine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead:\nhis lineaments softened and warmed.\n \nAfter supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been, what I\nhad been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very partial\nreplies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night. Besides, I\nwished to touch no deep-thrilling chord\u2014to open no fresh well of emotion in his\nheart: my sole present aim was to cheer him. Cheered, as I have said, he was:\nand yet but by fits. If a moment\u2019s silence broke the conversation, he would\nturn restless, touch me, then say, \u201cJane.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?\u201d\n \n\u201cI conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my\nlone hearth? I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and\nit was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John\u2019s wife to answer me,\nand your voice spoke at my ear.\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I had come in, in Mary\u2019s stead, with the tray.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can\ntell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?\nDoing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the\nsensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat:\nand then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold\nmy Jane again. Yes: for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of my\nlost sight. How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me? Will she\nnot depart as suddenly as she came? To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no\nmore.\u201d\n \nA commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed ideas,\nwas, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this frame of mind. I\npassed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and\nthat I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as\never.\n \n\u201cWhere is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some\nfatal moment, you will again desert me\u2014passing like a shadow, whither and how\nto me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you a pocket-comb about you, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat for, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cJust to comb out this shaggy black mane. I find you rather alarming, when I\nexamine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are\nmore like a brownie.\u201d\n \n\u201cAm I hideous, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery, sir: you always were, you know.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have\nsojourned.\u201d\n \n\u201cYet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better\npeople; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite\nmore refined and exalted.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho the deuce have you been with?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and\nthen I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho have you been with, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till to-morrow; to\nleave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall\nappear at your breakfast table to finish it. By the bye, I must mind not to\nrise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the\nleast, to say nothing of fried ham.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou mocking changeling\u2014fairy-born and human-bred! You make me feel as I have\nnot felt these twelve months. If Saul could have had you for his David, the\nevil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I\u2019ll leave you: I have been\ntravelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired. Good night.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?\u201d\n \nI laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs. \u201cA good idea!\u201d\nI thought with glee. \u201cI see I have the means of fretting him out of his\nmelancholy for some time to come.\u201d\n \nVery early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one room\nto another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: \u201cIs Miss Eyre\nhere?\u201d Then: \u201cWhich room did you put her into? Was it dry? Is she up? Go and\nask if she wants anything; and when she will come down.\u201d\n \nI came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast. Entering\nthe room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered my presence. It\nwas mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a\ncorporeal infirmity. He sat in his chair\u2014still, but not at rest: expectant\nevidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking his strong features. His\ncountenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit\u2014and alas! it\nwas not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was\ndependent on another for that office! I had meant to be gay and careless, but\nthe powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I\naccosted him with what vivacity I could.\n \n\u201cIt is a bright, sunny morning, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cThe rain is over and gone, and\nthere is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon.\u201d\n \nI had wakened the glow: his features beamed.\n \n\u201cOh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone: not\nvanished? I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but\nits song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays. All the\nmelody on earth is concentrated in my Jane\u2019s tongue to my ear (I am glad it is\nnot naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.\u201d\n \nThe water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as if a\nroyal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a sparrow to\nbecome its purveyor. But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt\ndrops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.\n \nMost of the morning was spent in the open air. I led him out of the wet and\nwild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how brilliantly green\nthey were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue\nwas the sky. I sought a seat for him in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump\nof a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when seated, place me on his knee. Why\nshould I, when both he and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us:\nall was quiet. He broke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms\u2014\n \n\u201cCruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had\nfled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining\nyour apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which\ncould serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in\nits little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been\nprepared for the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute\nand penniless? And what did she do? Let me hear now.\u201d\n \nThus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I\nsoftened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and\nstarvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary\npain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I wished.\n \nI should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my way: I\nshould have told him my intention. I should have confided in him: he would\nnever have forced me to be his mistress. Violent as he had seemed in his\ndespair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute\nhimself my tyrant: he would have given me half his fortune, without demanding\nso much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless\non the wide world. I had endured, he was certain, more than I had confessed to\nhim.\n \n\u201cWell, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,\u201d I answered: and\nthen I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at Moor House; how I had\nobtained the office of schoolmistress, &c. The accession of fortune, the\ndiscovery of my relations, followed in due order. Of course, St. John Rivers\u2019\nname came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name\nwas immediately taken up.\n \n\u201cThis St. John, then, is your cousin?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou have spoken of him often: do you like him?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.\u201d\n \n\u201cA good man. Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what\ndoes it mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cSt John was only twenty-nine, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2018Jeune encore,\u2019 as the French say. Is he a person of low stature,\nphlegmatic, and plain? A person whose goodness consists rather in his\nguiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is untiringly active. Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to\nperform.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut his brain? That is probably rather soft? He means well: but you shrug your\nshoulders to hear him talk?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point. His brain is\nfirst-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs he an able man, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cTruly able.\u201d\n \n\u201cA thoroughly educated man?\u201d\n \n\u201cSt. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?\u2014priggish and parsonic?\u201d\n \n\u201cI never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they must\nsuit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.\u201d\n \n\u201cHis appearance,\u2014I forget what description you gave of his appearance;\u2014a sort\nof raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted up on his\nthick-soled high-lows, eh?\u201d\n \n\u201cSt. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a\nGrecian profile.\u201d\n \n(Aside.) \u201cDamn him!\u201d\u2014(To me.) \u201cDid you like him, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.\u201d\n \nI perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor. Jealousy had got hold of\nhim: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him respite from the\ngnawing fang of melancholy. I would not, therefore, immediately charm the\nsnake.\n \n\u201cPerhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?\u201d was the\nnext somewhat unexpected observation.\n \n\u201cWhy not, Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming\ncontrast. Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: he is\npresent to your imagination,\u2014tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile.\nYour eyes dwell on a Vulcan,\u2014a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and\nblind and lame into the bargain.\u201d\n \n\u201cI never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you can leave me, ma\u2019am: but before you go\u201d (and he retained me by a\nfirmer grasp than ever), \u201cyou will be pleased just to answer me a question or\ntwo.\u201d He paused.\n \n\u201cWhat questions, Mr. Rochester?\u201d\n \nThen followed this cross-examination.\n \n\u201cSt. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his\ncousin?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou would often see him? He would visit the school sometimes?\u201d\n \n\u201cDaily.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe would approve of your plans, Jane? I know they would be clever, for you are\na talented creature!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe approved of them\u2014yes.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find? Some\nof your accomplishments are not ordinary.\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to\nsee you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNow and then.\u201d\n \n\u201cOf an evening?\u201d\n \n\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d\n \nA pause.\n \n\u201cHow long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was\ndiscovered?\u201d\n \n\u201cFive months.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and\nwe by the table.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid he study much?\u201d\n \n\u201cA good deal.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n \n\u201cHindostanee.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what did you do meantime?\u201d\n \n\u201cI learnt German, at first.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid he teach you?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe did not understand German.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid he teach you nothing?\u201d\n \n\u201cA little Hindostanee.\u201d\n \n\u201cRivers taught you Hindostanee?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd his sisters also?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly you?\u201d\n \n\u201cOnly me.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you ask to learn?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe wished to teach you?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes.\u201d\n \nA second pause.\n \n\u201cWhy did he wish it? Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe intended me to go with him to India.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! here I reach the root of the matter. He wanted you to marry him?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe asked me to marry him.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is a fiction\u2014an impudent invention to vex me.\u201d\n \n\u201cI beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and\nwas as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.\u201d\n \n\u201cMiss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me. How often am I to say the same\nthing? Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given\nyou notice to quit?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause I am comfortable there.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it\nis with this cousin\u2014this St. John. Oh, till this moment, I thought my little\nJane was all mine! I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was\nan atom of sweet in much bitter. Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I\nhave wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her,\nshe was loving another! But it is useless grieving. Jane, leave me: go and\nmarry Rivers.\u201d\n \n\u201cShake me off, then, sir,\u2014push me away, for I\u2019ll not leave you of my own\naccord.\u201d\n \n\u201cJane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so\ntruthful. When I hear it, it carries me back a year. I forget that you have\nformed a new tie. But I am not a fool\u2014go\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere must I go, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cYour own way\u2014with the husband you have chosen.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho is that?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou know\u2014this St. John Rivers.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe is not my husband, nor ever will be. He does not love me: I do not love\nhim. He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you love) a beautiful\nyoung lady called Rosamond. He wanted to marry me only because he thought I\nshould make a suitable missionary\u2019s wife, which she would not have done. He is\ngood and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg. He is not like\nyou, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him. He has no\nindulgence for me\u2014no fondness. He sees nothing attractive in me; not even\nyouth\u2014only a few useful mental points.\u2014Then I must leave you, sir, to go to\nhim?\u201d\n \nI shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but\nbeloved master. He smiled.\n \n\u201cWhat, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and\nRivers?\u201d\n \n\u201cAbsolutely, sir! Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a little\nto make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you\nwish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would\nbe proud and content. All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with\nyou it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for\never.\u201d\n \nAgain, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.\n \n\u201cMy seared vision! My crippled strength!\u201d he murmured regretfully.\n \nI caressed, in order to soothe him. I knew of what he was thinking, and wanted\nto speak for him, but dared not. As he turned aside his face a minute, I saw a\ntear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek. My\nheart swelled.\n \n\u201cI am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield\norchard,\u201d he remarked ere long. \u201cAnd what right would that ruin have to bid a\nbudding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are no ruin, sir\u2014no lightning-struck tree: you are green and vigorous.\nPlants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they\ntake delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow they will lean towards\nyou, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop.\u201d\n \nAgain he smiled: I gave him comfort.\n \n\u201cYou speak of friends, Jane?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cYes, of friends,\u201d I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant more than\nfriends, but could not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.\n \n\u201cAh! Jane. But I want a wife.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes: is it news to you?\u201d\n \n\u201cOf course: you said nothing about it before.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it unwelcome news?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat depends on circumstances, sir\u2014on your choice.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich you shall make for me, Jane. I will abide by your decision.\u201d\n \n\u201cChoose then, sir\u2014her who loves you best.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will at least choose\u2014her I love best. Jane, will you marry me?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cA poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cA crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cTruly, Jane?\u201d\n \n\u201cMost truly, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! my darling! God bless you and reward you!\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life\u2014if ever I thought a good\nthought\u2014if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer\u2014if ever I wished a\nrighteous wish,\u2014I am rewarded now. To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy\nas I can be on earth.\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause you delight in sacrifice.\u201d\n \n\u201cSacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. To\nbe privileged to put my arms round what I value\u2014to press my lips to what I\nlove\u2014to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice? If so, then\ncertainly I delight in sacrifice.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich are none, sir, to me. I love you better now, when I can really be useful\nto you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained\nevery part but that of the giver and protector.\u201d\n \n\u201cHitherto I have hated to be helped\u2014to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate\nit no more. I did not like to put my hand into a hireling\u2019s, but it is pleasant\nto feel it circled by Jane\u2019s little fingers. I preferred utter loneliness to\nthe constant attendance of servants; but Jane\u2019s soft ministry will be a\nperpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her?\u201d\n \n\u201cTo the finest fibre of my nature, sir.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be\nmarried instantly.\u201d\n \nHe looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.\n \n\u201cWe must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the licence to\nget\u2014then we marry.\u201d\n \n\u201cMr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its\nmeridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. Let me look at your\nwatch.\u201d\n \n\u201cFasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no use for\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is nearly four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, sir. Don\u2019t you feel hungry?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane. Never mind fine clothes\nand jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir. The breeze is still: it is quite\nhot.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened\nround my bronze scrag under my cravat? I have worn it since the day I lost my\nonly treasure, as a memento of her.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.\u201d\n \nHe pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.\n \n\u201cJane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with\ngratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees not as man\nsees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did\nwrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower\u2014breathed guilt on its purity:\nthe Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost\ncursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine\njustice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass\nthrough the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty;\nand one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my\nstrength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as\na child does its weakness? Of late, Jane\u2014only\u2014only of late\u2014I began to see and\nacknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse,\nrepentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray:\nvery brief prayers they were, but very sincere.\n \n\u201cSome days since: nay, I can number them\u2014four; it was last Monday night, a\nsingular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy\u2014sorrow,\nsullenness. I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you,\nyou must be dead. Late that night\u2014perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve\no\u2019clock\u2014ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed\ngood to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world\nto come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.\n \n\u201cI was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me\nto feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague,\nluminous haze, knew the presence of a moon. I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I\nlonged for thee both with soul and flesh! I asked of God, at once in anguish\nand humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and\nmight not soon taste bliss and peace once more. That I merited all I endured, I\nacknowledged\u2014that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and\nomega of my heart\u2019s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words\u2014\u2018Jane!\nJane! Jane!\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cDid you speak these words aloud?\u201d\n \n\u201cI did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I\npronounced them with such frantic energy.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point.\nYou will think me superstitious,\u2014some superstition I have in my blood, and\nalways had: nevertheless, this is true\u2014true at least it is that I heard what I\nnow relate.\n \n\u201cAs I exclaimed \u2018Jane! Jane! Jane!\u2019 a voice\u2014I cannot tell whence the voice\ncame, but I know whose voice it was\u2014replied, \u2018I am coming: wait for me;\u2019 and a\nmoment after, went whispering on the wind the words\u2014\u2018Where are you?\u2019\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind:\nyet it is difficult to express what I want to express. Ferndean is buried, as\nyou see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.\n\u2018Where are you?\u2019 seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo\nrepeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my\nbrow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were\nmeeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met. You no doubt were, at that\nhour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to\ncomfort mine; for those were your accents\u2014as certain as I live\u2014they were\nyours!\u201d\n \nReader, it was on Monday night\u2014near midnight\u2014that I too had received the\nmysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it. I\nlistened to Mr. Rochester\u2019s narrative, but made no disclosure in return. The\ncoincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or\ndiscussed. If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a\nprofound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its\nsufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.\nI kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.\n \n\u201cYou cannot now wonder,\u201d continued my master, \u201cthat when you rose upon me so\nunexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a\nmere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation,\nas the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before. Now, I thank God!\nI know it to be otherwise. Yes, I thank God!\u201d\n \nHe put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his brow, and\nbending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute devotion. Only the\nlast words of the worship were audible.\n \n\u201cI thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy. I\nhumbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life\nthan I have done hitherto!\u201d\n \nThen he stretched his hand out to be led. I took that dear hand, held it a\nmoment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of\nstature than he, I served both for his prop and guide. We entered the wood, and\nwended homeward.\n",
        "\nReader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk,\nwere alone present. When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of\nthe manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the\nknives, and I said\u2014\n \n\u201cMary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.\u201d The housekeeper and\nher husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one\nmay at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring\nthe danger of having one\u2019s ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and\nsubsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and\nshe did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens\nroasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for\nthe same space of time John\u2019s knives also had rest from the polishing process:\nbut Mary, bending again over the roast, said only\u2014\n \n\u201cHave you, Miss? Well, for sure!\u201d\n \nA short time after she pursued\u2014\u201cI seed you go out with the master, but I didn\u2019t\nknow you were gone to church to be wed;\u201d and she basted away. John, when I\nturned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.\n \n\u201cI telled Mary how it would be,\u201d he said: \u201cI knew what Mr. Edward\u201d (John was an\nold servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the house,\ntherefore, he often gave him his Christian name)\u2014\u201cI knew what Mr. Edward would\ndo; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he\u2019s done right, for\naught I know. I wish you joy, Miss!\u201d and he politely pulled his forelock.\n \n\u201cThank you, John. Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.\u201d I put into\nhis hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen.\nIn passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words\u2014\n \n\u201cShe\u2019ll happen do better for him nor ony o\u2019 t\u2019 grand ladies.\u201d And again, \u201cIf\nshe ben\u2019t one o\u2019 th\u2019 handsomest, she\u2019s noan fa\u00e2l and varry good-natured; and i\u2019\nhis een she\u2019s fair beautiful, onybody may see that.\u201d\n \nI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done:\nfully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and Mary approved the step\nunreservedly. Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the\nhoneymoon, and then she would come and see me.\n \n\u201cShe had better not wait till then, Jane,\u201d said Mr. Rochester, when I read her\nletter to him; \u201cif she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine\nour life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.\u201d\n \nHow St. John received the news, I don\u2019t know: he never answered the letter in\nwhich I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however,\nmentioning Mr. Rochester\u2019s name or alluding to my marriage. His letter was then\ncalm, and, though very serious, kind. He has maintained a regular, though not\nfrequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not\nof those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.\n \nYou have not quite forgotten little Ad\u00e8le, have you, reader? I had not; I soon\nasked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at the school\nwhere he had placed her. Her frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.\nShe looked pale and thin: she said she was not happy. I found the rules of the\nestablishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of\nher age: I took her home with me. I meant to become her governess once more,\nbut I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by\nanother\u2014my husband needed them all. So I sought out a school conducted on a\nmore indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and\nbringing her home sometimes. I took care she should never want for anything\nthat could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode, became\nvery happy there, and made fair progress in her studies. As she grew up, a\nsound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects; and\nwhen she left school, I found in her a pleasing and obliging companion: docile,\ngood-tempered, and well-principled. By her grateful attention to me and mine,\nshe has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to\noffer her.\n \nMy tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life,\nand one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently\nrecurred in this narrative, and I have done.\n \nI have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and\nwith what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest\u2014blest beyond what\nlanguage can express; because I am my husband\u2019s life as fully as he is mine. No\nwoman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his\nbone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward\u2019s society: he\nknows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that\nbeats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together. To be\ntogether is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.\nWe talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated\nand an audible thinking. All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his\nconfidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character\u2014perfect\nconcord is the result.\n \nMr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was\nthat circumstance that drew us so very near\u2014that knit us so very close: for I\nwas then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what he\noften called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature\u2014he saw books through me;\nand never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the\neffect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam\u2014of the landscape before us;\nof the weather round us\u2014and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no\nlonger stamp on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary\nof conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to be\ndone. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even\nthough sad\u2014because he claimed these services without painful shame or damping\nhumiliation. He loved me so truly, that he knew no reluctance in profiting by\nmy attendance: he felt I loved him so fondly, that to yield that attendance was\nto indulge my sweetest wishes.\n \nOne morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his\ndictation, he came and bent over me, and said\u2014\u201cJane, have you a glittering\nornament round your neck?\u201d\n \nI had a gold watch-chain: I answered \u201cYes.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd have you a pale blue dress on?\u201d\n \nI had. He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity\nclouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.\n \nHe and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he\neventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now see very\ndistinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way without being\nled by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him\u2014the earth no longer a\nvoid. When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had\ninherited his own eyes, as they once were\u2014large, brilliant, and black. On that\noccasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered\njudgment with mercy.\n \nMy Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love\nare happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once\nevery year, they come to see us, and we go to see them. Diana\u2019s husband is a\ncaptain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary\u2019s is a clergyman, a\ncollege friend of her brother\u2019s, and, from his attainments and principles,\nworthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their\nwives, and are loved by them.\n \nAs to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India. He entered on the\npath he had marked for himself; he pursues it still. A more resolute,\nindefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers. Firm, faithful,\nand devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his race; he\nclears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the\nprejudices of creed and caste that encumber it. He may be stern; he may be\nexacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior\nGreatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon. His\nis the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he\nsays\u2014\u201cWhosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross\nand follow me.\u201d His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to\nfill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth\u2014who\nstand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty\nvictories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\n \nSt. John is unmarried: he never will marry now. Himself has hitherto sufficed\nto the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its\nsetting. The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and\nyet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his\nincorruptible crown. I know that a stranger\u2019s hand will write to me next, to\nsay that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy\nof his Lord. And why weep for this? No fear of death will darken St. John\u2019s\nlast hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope\nwill be sure, his faith steadfast. His own words are a pledge of this\u2014\n \n\u201cMy Master,\u201d he says, \u201chas forewarned me. Daily He announces more\ndistinctly,\u2014\u2018Surely I come quickly!\u2019 and hourly I more eagerly respond,\u2014\u2018Amen;\neven so come, Lord Jesus!\u2019\u201d\n"

He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\nmachine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\na false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\nsneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing\nthe veil from men\u2019s motives and actions.

His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and\nhis usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly,\nand the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver\ncaught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs,\nbeing his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat\nupon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought\nruns gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in\nthis way\u2014marking the points with a lean forefinger\u2014as we sat\nand lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\nand his fecundity.",
        "\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made.\nThere was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now\nI must be explicit, for this that follows\u2014unless his explanation is\nto be accepted\u2014is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of\nthe small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it\nin front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he\nplaced the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other\nobject on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell\nupon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass\ncandlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was\nbrilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I\ndrew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the\nfireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man\nand the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\nPsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the\nPsychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that\nany kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done,\ncould have been played upon us under these conditions.",
        "\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine.\nThe fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to\nbe believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always\nsuspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid\nfrankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time\nTraveller\u2019s words, we should have shown him far less\nscepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could\nunderstand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim\namong his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the\nfame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to\ndo things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their\nreputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with\neggshell china. So I don\u2019t think any of us said very much about time\ntravelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its\nodd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility,\nthat is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of\nanachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was\nparticularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember\ndiscussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linn\u00e6an.

I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the\nputting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was\nexactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing\nwas not complete until this morning. It was at ten o\u2019clock today\nthat the first of all Time Machines began its career.

I\ntook the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second.

For a\nlong time past he had been applying himself to the study of the Arab language\nand the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to his talents as a polyglot, he\nhad made rapid progress.",
        "\n\nA Servant\u2014match him!\u2014He can see the Satellites of\nJupiter.\u2014Dick and Joe hard at it.\u2014Doubt and Faith.\u2014The\nWeighing Ceremony.\u2014Joe and Wellington.\u2014He gets a Half-crown.\n \nDr. Ferguson had a servant who answered with alacrity to the name of Joe. He\nwas an excellent fellow, who testified the most absolute confidence in his\nmaster, and the most unlimited devotion to his interests, even anticipating his\nwishes and orders, which were always intelligently executed. In fine, he was a\nCaleb without the growling, and a perfect pattern of constant good-humor. Had\nhe been made on purpose for the place, it could not have been better done.\nFerguson put himself entirely in his hands, so far as the ordinary details of\nexistence were concerned, and he did well. Incomparable, whole-souled Joe! a\nservant who orders your dinner; who likes what you like; who packs your trunk,\nwithout forgetting your socks or your linen; who has charge of your keys and\nyour secrets, and takes no advantage of all this!\n \nBut then, what a man the doctor was in the eyes of this worthy Joe! With what\nrespect and what confidence the latter received all his decisions! When\nFerguson had spoken, he would be a fool who should attempt to question the\nmatter. Every thing he thought was exactly right; every thing he said, the\nperfection of wisdom; every thing he ordered to be done, quite feasible; all\nthat he undertook, practicable; all that he accomplished, admirable. You might\nhave cut Joe to pieces\u2014not an agreeable operation, to be sure\u2014and\nyet he would not have altered his opinion of his master.\n \nSo, when the doctor conceived the project of crossing Africa through the air,\nfor Joe the thing was already done; obstacles no longer existed; from the\nmoment when the doctor had made up his mind to start, he had\narrived\u2014along with his faithful attendant, too, for the noble fellow\nknew, without a word uttered about it, that he would be one of the party.\n \nMoreover, he was just the man to render the greatest service by his\nintelligence and his wonderful agility. Had the occasion arisen to name a\nprofessor of gymnastics for the monkeys in the Zoological Garden (who are smart\nenough, by-the-way!), Joe would certainly have received the appointment.\nLeaping, climbing, almost flying\u2014these were all sport to him.\n \nIf Ferguson was the head and Kennedy the arm, Joe was to be the right hand of\nthe expedition. He had, already, accompanied his master on several journeys,\nand had a smattering of science appropriate to his condition and style of mind,\nbut he was especially remarkable for a sort of mild philosophy, a charming turn\nof optimism. In his sight every thing was easy, logical, natural, and,\nconsequently, he could see no use in complaining or grumbling.\n \nAmong other gifts, he possessed a strength and range of vision that were\nperfectly surprising. He enjoyed, in common with Moestlin, Kepler\u2019s\nprofessor, the rare faculty of distinguishing the satellites of Jupiter with\nthe naked eye, and of counting fourteen of the stars in the group of Pleiades,\nthe remotest of them being only of the ninth magnitude. He presumed none the\nmore for that; on the contrary, he made his bow to you, at a distance, and when\noccasion arose he bravely knew how to use his eyes.\n \nWith such profound faith as Joe felt in the doctor, it is not to be wondered at\nthat incessant discussions sprang up between him and Kennedy, without any lack\nof respect to the latter, however.\n \nOne doubted, the other believed; one had a prudent foresight, the other blind\nconfidence. The doctor, however, vibrated between doubt and confidence; that is\nto say, he troubled his head with neither one nor the other.\n \n\u201cWell, Mr. Kennedy,\u201d Joe would say.\n \n\u201cWell, my boy?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe moment\u2019s at hand. It seems that we are to sail for the\nmoon.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou mean the Mountains of the Moon, which are not quite so far off. But,\nnever mind, one trip is just as dangerous as the other!\u201d\n \n\u201cDangerous! What! with a man like Dr. Ferguson?\u201d\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to spoil your illusions, my good Joe; but this\nundertaking of his is nothing more nor less than the act of a madman. He\nwon\u2019t go, though!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe won\u2019t go, eh? Then you haven\u2019t seen his balloon at\nMitchell\u2019s factory in the Borough?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll take precious good care to keep away from it!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll lose a fine sight, sir. What a splendid thing it is!\nWhat a pretty shape! What a nice car! How snug we\u2019ll feel in it!\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you really think of going with your master?\u201d\n \n\u201cI?\u201d answered Joe, with an accent of profound conviction.\n\u201cWhy, I\u2019d go with him wherever he pleases! Who ever heard of such a\nthing? Leave him to go off alone, after we\u2019ve been all over the world\ntogether! Who would help him, when he was tired? Who would give him a hand in\nclimbing over the rocks? Who would attend him when he was sick? No, Mr.\nKennedy, Joe will always stick to the doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re a fine fellow, Joe!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, then, you\u2019re coming with us!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cthat is to say, I will go\nwith you up to the last moment, to prevent Samuel even then from being guilty\nof such an act of folly! I will follow him as far as Zanzibar, so as to stop\nhim there, if possible.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll stop nothing at all, Mr. Kennedy, with all respect to you,\nsir. My master is no hare-brained person; he takes a long time to think over\nwhat he means to do, and then, when he once gets started, the Evil One himself\ncouldn\u2019t make him give it up.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see about that.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, sir\u2014but then, the main thing is, to\nhave you with us. For a hunter like you, sir, Africa\u2019s a great country.\nSo, either way, you won\u2019t be sorry for the trip.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, that\u2019s a fact, I shan\u2019t be sorry for it, if I can get\nthis crazy man to give up his scheme.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy-the-way,\u201d said Joe, \u201cyou know that the weighing comes off\nto-day.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe weighing\u2014what weighing?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, my master, and you, and I, are all to be weighed to-day!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! like horse-jockeys?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, like jockeys. Only, never fear, you won\u2019t be expected to make\nyourself lean, if you\u2019re found to be heavy. You\u2019ll go as you\nare.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I can tell you, I am not going to let myself be weighed,\u201d\nsaid Kennedy, firmly.\n \n\u201cBut, sir, it seems that the doctor\u2019s machine requires it.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, his machine will have to do without it.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! and suppose that it couldn\u2019t go up, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cEgad! that\u2019s all I want!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome! come, Mr. Kennedy! My master will be sending for us\ndirectly.\u201d\n \n\u201cI shan\u2019t go.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! now, you won\u2019t vex the doctor in that way!\u201d\n \n\u201cAye! that I will.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell!\u201d said Joe with a laugh, \u201cyou say that because\nhe\u2019s not here; but when he says to your face, \u2018Dick!\u2019 (with\nall respect to you, sir,) \u2018Dick, I want to know exactly how much you\nweigh,\u2019 you\u2019ll go, I warrant it.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I will not go!\u201d\n \nAt this moment the doctor entered his study, where this discussion had been\ntaking place; and, as he came in, cast a glance at Kennedy, who did not feel\naltogether at his ease.\n \n\u201cDick,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccome with Joe; I want to know how\nmuch you both weigh.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may keep your hat on. Come!\u201d And Kennedy went.\n \nThey repaired in company to the workshop of the Messrs. Mitchell, where one of\nthose so-called \u201cRoman\u201d scales was in readiness. It was necessary,\nby the way, for the doctor to know the weight of his companions, so as to fix\nthe equilibrium of his balloon; so he made Dick get up on the platform of the\nscales. The latter, without making any resistance, said, in an undertone:\n \n\u201cOh! well, that doesn\u2019t bind me to any thing.\u201d\n \n\u201cOne hundred and fifty-three pounds,\u201d said the doctor, noting it\ndown on his tablets.\n \n\u201cAm I too heavy?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, no, Mr. Kennedy!\u201d said Joe; \u201cand then, you know, I am\nlight to make up for it.\u201d\n \nSo saying, Joe, with enthusiasm, took his place on the scales, and very nearly\nupset them in his ready haste. He struck the attitude of Wellington where he is\nmade to ape Achilles, at Hyde-Park entrance, and was superb in it, without the\nshield.\n \n\u201cOne hundred and twenty pounds,\u201d wrote the doctor.\n \n\u201cAh! ha!\u201d said Joe, with a smile of satisfaction And why did he\nsmile? He never could tell himself.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s my turn now,\u201d said Ferguson\u2014and he put down one\nhundred and thirty-five pounds to his own account.\n \n\u201cAll three of us,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not weigh much more than four\nhundred pounds.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Joe, \u201cif it was necessary for your\nexpedition, I could make myself thinner by twenty pounds, by not eating so\nmuch.\u201d\n \n\u201cUseless, my boy!\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cYou may eat as much\nas you like, and here\u2019s half-a-crown to buy you the ballast.\u201d\n",
        "\n\nGeometrical Details.\u2014Calculation of the Capacity of the\nBalloon.\u2014The Double Receptacle.\u2014The Covering.\u2014The\nCar.\u2014The Mysterious Apparatus.\u2014The Provisions and Stores.\u2014The\nFinal Summing up.\n \nDr. Ferguson had long been engaged upon the details of his expedition. It is\neasy to comprehend that the balloon\u2014that marvellous vehicle which was to\nconvey him through the air\u2014was the constant object of his solicitude.\n \nAt the outset, in order not to give the balloon too ponderous dimensions, he\nhad decided to fill it with hydrogen gas, which is fourteen and a half times\nlighter than common air. The production of this gas is easy, and it has given\nthe greatest satisfaction hitherto in aerostatic experiments.\n \nThe doctor, according to very accurate calculations, found that, including the\narticles indispensable to his journey and his apparatus, he should have to\ncarry a weight of 4,000 pounds; therefore he had to find out what would be the\nascensional force of a balloon capable of raising such a weight, and,\nconsequently, what would be its capacity.\n \nA weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the air\namounting to forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet; or,\nin other words, forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of\nair weigh about four thousand pounds.\n \nBy giving the balloon these cubic dimensions, and filling it with hydrogen gas,\ninstead of common air\u2014the former being fourteen and a half times lighter\nand weighing therefore only two hundred and seventy-six pounds\u2014a\ndifference of three thousand seven hundred and twenty-four pounds in\nequilibrium is produced; and it is this difference between the weight of the\ngas contained in the balloon and the weight of the surrounding atmosphere that\nconstitutes the ascensional force of the former.\n \nHowever, were the forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet\nof gas of which we speak, all introduced into the balloon, it would be entirely\nfilled; but that would not do, because, as the balloon continued to mount into\nthe more rarefied layers of the atmosphere, the gas within would dilate, and\nsoon burst the cover containing it. Balloons, then, are usually only two-thirds\nfilled.\n \nBut the doctor, in carrying out a project known only to himself, resolved to\nfill his balloon only one-half; and, since he had to carry forty-four thousand\neight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of gas, to give his balloon nearly\ndouble capacity he arranged it in that elongated, oval shape which has come to\nbe preferred. The horizontal diameter was fifty feet, and the vertical diameter\nseventy-five feet. He thus obtained a spheroid, the capacity of which amounted,\nin round numbers, to ninety thousand cubic feet.\n \nCould Dr. Ferguson have used two balloons, his chances of success would have\nbeen increased; for, should one burst in the air, he could, by throwing out\nballast, keep himself up with the other. But the management of two balloons\nwould, necessarily, be very difficult, in view of the problem how to keep them\nboth at an equal ascensional force.\n \nAfter having pondered the matter carefully, Dr. Ferguson, by an ingenious\narrangement, combined the advantages of two balloons, without incurring their\ninconveniences. He constructed two of different sizes, and inclosed the smaller\nin the larger one. His external balloon, which had the dimensions given above,\ncontained a less one of the same shape, which was only forty-five feet in\nhorizontal, and sixty-eight feet in vertical diameter. The capacity of this\ninterior balloon was only sixty-seven thousand cubic feet: it was to float in\nthe fluid surrounding it. A valve opened from one balloon into the other, and\nthus enabled the a\u00ebronaut to communicate with both.\n \nThis arrangement offered the advantage, that if gas had to be let off, so as to\ndescend, that which was in the outer balloon would go first; and, were it\ncompletely emptied, the smaller one would still remain intact. The outer\nenvelope might then be cast off as a useless encumbrance; and the second\nballoon, left free to itself, would not offer the same hold to the currents of\nair as a half-inflated one must needs present.\n \nMoreover, in case of an accident happening to the outside balloon, such as\ngetting torn, for instance, the other would remain intact.\n \nThe balloons were made of a strong but light Lyons silk, coated with gutta\npercha. This gummy, resinous substance is absolutely water-proof, and also\nresists acids and gas perfectly. The silk was doubled, at the upper extremity\nof the oval, where most of the strain would come.\n \nSuch an envelope as this could retain the inflating fluid for any length of\ntime. It weighed half a pound per nine square feet. Hence the surface of the\noutside balloon being about eleven thousand six hundred square feet, its\nenvelope weighed six hundred and fifty pounds. The envelope of the second or\ninner balloon, having nine thousand two hundred square feet of surface, weighed\nonly about five hundred and ten pounds, or say eleven hundred and sixty pounds\nfor both.\n \nThe network that supported the car was made of very strong hempen cord, and the\ntwo valves were the object of the most minute and careful attention, as the\nrudder of a ship would be.\n \nThe car, which was of a circular form and fifteen feet in diameter, was made of\nwicker-work, strengthened with a slight covering of iron, and protected below\nby a system of elastic springs, to deaden the shock of collision. Its weight,\nalong with that of the network, did not exceed two hundred and fifty pounds.\n \nIn addition to the above, the doctor caused to be constructed two sheet-iron\nchests two lines in thickness. These were connected by means of pipes furnished\nwith stopcocks. He joined to these a spiral, two inches in diameter, which\nterminated in two branch pieces of unequal length, the longer of which,\nhowever, was twenty-five feet in height and the shorter only fifteen feet.\n \nThese sheet-iron chests were embedded in the car in such a way as to take up\nthe least possible amount of space. The spiral, which was not to be adjusted\nuntil some future moment, was packed up, separately, along with a very strong\nBuntzen electric battery. This apparatus had been so ingeniously combined that\nit did not weigh more than seven hundred pounds, even including twenty-five\ngallons of water in another receptacle.\n \nThe instruments provided for the journey consisted of two barometers, two\nthermometers, two compasses, a sextant, two chronometers, an artificial\nhorizon, and an altazimuth, to throw out the height of distant and inaccessible\nobjects.\n \nThe Greenwich Observatory had placed itself at the doctor\u2019s disposal. The\nlatter, however, did not intend to make experiments in physics; he merely\nwanted to be able to know in what direction he was passing, and to determine\nthe position of the principal rivers, mountains, and towns.\n \nHe also provided himself with three thoroughly tested iron anchors, and a light\nbut strong silk ladder fifty feet in length.\n \nHe at the same time carefully weighed his stores of provision, which consisted\nof tea, coffee, biscuit, salted meat, and pemmican, a preparation which\ncomprises many nutritive elements in a small space. Besides a sufficient stock\nof pure brandy, he arranged two water-tanks, each of which contained twenty-two\ngallons.\n \nThe consumption of these articles would necessarily, little by little, diminish\nthe weight to be sustained, for it must be remembered that the equilibrium of a\nballoon floating in the atmosphere is extremely sensitive. The loss of an\nalmost insignificant weight suffices to produce a very noticeable displacement.\n \nNor did the doctor forget an awning to shelter the car, nor the coverings and\nblankets that were to be the bedding of the journey, nor some fowling pieces\nand rifles, with their requisite supply of powder and ball.\n \nHere is the summing up of his various items, and their weight, as he computed\nit:\n \nSuch were the items of the four thousand pounds that Dr. Ferguson proposed to\ncarry up with him. He took only two hundred pounds of ballast for\n\u201cunforeseen emergencies,\u201d as he remarked, since otherwise he did\nnot expect to use any, thanks to the peculiarity of his apparatus.\n",
        "\n\nJoe\u2019s Importance.\u2014The Commander of the\nResolute.\u2014Kennedy\u2019s Arsenal.\u2014Mutual Amenities.\u2014The\nFarewell Dinner.\u2014Departure on the 21st of February.\u2014The\nDoctor\u2019s Scientific\nSessions.\u2014Duveyrier.\u2014Livingstone.\u2014Details of the Aerial\nVoyage.\u2014Kennedy silenced.\n \nAbout the 10th of February, the preparations were pretty well completed; and\nthe balloons, firmly secured, one within the other, were altogether finished.\nThey had been subjected to a powerful pneumatic pressure in all parts, and the\ntest gave excellent evidence of their solidity and of the care applied in their\nconstruction.\n \nJoe hardly knew what he was about, with delight. He trotted incessantly to and\nfro between his home in Greek Street, and the Mitchell establishment, always\nfull of business, but always in the highest spirits, giving details of the\naffair to people who did not even ask him, so proud was he, above all things,\nof being permitted to accompany his master. I have even a shrewd suspicion that\nwhat with showing the balloon, explaining the plans and views of the doctor,\ngiving folks a glimpse of the latter, through a half-opened window, or pointing\nhim out as he passed along the streets, the clever scamp earned a few\nhalf-crowns, but we must not find fault with him for that. He had as much right\nas anybody else to speculate upon the admiration and curiosity of his\ncontemporaries.\n \nOn the 16th of February, the Resolute cast anchor near Greenwich. She\nwas a screw propeller of eight hundred tons, a fast sailer, and the very vessel\nthat had been sent out to the polar regions, to revictual the last expedition\nof Sir James Ross. Her commander, Captain Bennet, had the name of being a very\namiable person, and he took a particular interest in the doctor\u2019s\nexpedition, having been one of that gentleman\u2019s admirers for a long time.\nBennet was rather a man of science than a man of war, which did not, however,\nprevent his vessel from carrying four carronades, that had never hurt any body,\nto be sure, but had performed the most pacific duty in the world.\n \nThe hold of the Resolute was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for\nthe balloon. The latter was shipped with the greatest precaution on the 18th of\nFebruary, and was then carefully deposited at the bottom of the vessel in such\na way as to prevent accident. The car and its accessories, the anchors, the\ncords, the supplies, the water-tanks, which were to be filled on arriving, all\nwere embarked and put away under Ferguson\u2019s own eyes.\n \nTen tons of sulphuric acid and ten tons of iron filings, were put on board for\nthe future production of the hydrogen gas. The quantity was more than enough,\nbut it was well to be provided against accident. The apparatus to be employed\nin manufacturing the gas, including some thirty empty casks, was also stowed\naway in the hold.\n \nThese various preparations were terminated on the 18th of February, in the\nevening. Two state-rooms, comfortably fitted up, were ready for the reception\nof Dr. Ferguson and his friend Kennedy. The latter, all the while swearing that\nhe would not go, went on board with a regular arsenal of hunting weapons, among\nwhich were two double-barrelled breech-loading fowling-pieces, and a rifle that\nhad withstood every test, of the make of Purdey, Moore & Dickson, at\nEdinburgh. With such a weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a\nbullet in the eye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces. Along\nwith these implements, he had two of Colt\u2019s six-shooters, for unforeseen\nemergencies. His powder-case, his cartridge-pouch, his lead, and his bullets,\ndid not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor.\n \nThe three travellers got themselves to rights on board during the working-hours\nof February 19th. They were received with much distinction by the captain and\nhis officers, the doctor continuing as reserved as ever, and thinking of\nnothing but his expedition. Dick seemed a good deal moved, but was unwilling to\nbetray it; while Joe was fairly dancing and breaking out in laughable remarks.\nThe worthy fellow soon became the jester and merry-andrew of the\nboatswain\u2019s mess, where a berth had been kept for him.\n \nOn the 20th, a grand farewell dinner was given to Dr. Ferguson and Kennedy by\nthe Royal Geographical Society. Commander Bennet and his officers were present\nat the entertainment, which was signalized by copious libations and numerous\ntoasts. Healths were drunk, in sufficient abundance to guarantee all the guests\na lifetime of centuries. Sir Francis M\u2014\u2014presided, with restrained\nbut dignified feeling.\n \nTo his own supreme confusion, Dick Kennedy came in for a large share in the\njovial felicitations of the night. After having drunk to the \u201cintrepid\nFerguson, the glory of England,\u201d they had to drink to \u201cthe no less\ncourageous Kennedy, his daring companion.\u201d\n \nDick blushed a good deal, and that passed for modesty; whereupon the applause\nredoubled, and Dick blushed again.\n \nA message from the Queen arrived while they were at dessert. Her Majesty\noffered her compliments to the two travellers, and expressed her wishes for\ntheir safe and successful journey. This, of course, rendered imperative fresh\ntoasts to \u201cHer most gracious Majesty.\u201d\n \nAt midnight, after touching farewells and warm shaking of hands, the guests\nseparated.\n \nThe boats of the Resolute were in waiting at the stairs of Westminster\nBridge. The captain leaped in, accompanied by his officers and passengers, and\nthe rapid current of the Thames, aiding the strong arms of the rowers, bore\nthem swiftly to Greenwich. In an hour\u2019s time all were asleep on board.\n \nThe next morning, February 21st, at three o\u2019clock, the furnaces began to\nroar; at five, the anchors were weighed, and the Resolute, powerfully\ndriven by her screw, began to plough the water toward the mouth of the Thames.\n \nIt is needless to say that the topic of conversation with every one on board\nwas Dr. Ferguson\u2019s enterprise. Seeing and hearing the doctor soon\ninspired everybody with such confidence that, in a very short time, there was\nno one, excepting the incredulous Scotchman, on the steamer who had the least\ndoubt of the perfect feasibility and success of the expedition.\n \nDuring the long, unoccupied hours of the voyage, the doctor held regular\nsittings, with lectures on geographical science, in the officers\u2019\nmess-room. These young men felt an intense interest in the discoveries made\nduring the last forty years in Africa; and the doctor related to them the\nexplorations of Barth, Burton, Speke, and Grant, and depicted the wonders of\nthis vast, mysterious country, now thrown open on all sides to the\ninvestigations of science. On the north, the young Duveyrier was exploring\nSahara, and bringing the chiefs of the Touaregs to Paris. Under the inspiration\nof the French Government, two expeditions were preparing, which, descending\nfrom the north, and coming from the west, would cross each other at Timbuctoo.\nIn the south, the indefatigable Livingstone was still advancing toward the\nequator; and, since March, 1862, he had, in company with Mackenzie, ascended\nthe river Rovoonia. The nineteenth century would, assuredly, not pass,\ncontended the doctor, without Africa having been compelled to surrender the\nsecrets she has kept locked up in her bosom for six thousand years.\n \nBut the interest of Dr. Ferguson\u2019s hearers was excited to the highest\npitch when he made known to them, in detail, the preparations for his own\njourney. They took pleasure in verifying his calculations; they discussed them;\nand the doctor frankly took part in the discussion.\n \nAs a general thing, they were surprised at the limited quantity of provision\nthat he took with him; and one day one of the officers questioned him on that\nsubject.\n \n\u201cThat peculiar point astonishes you, does it?\u201d said Ferguson.\n \n\u201cIt does, indeed.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut how long do you think my trip is going to last? Whole months? If so,\nyou are greatly mistaken. Were it to be a long one, we should be lost; we\nshould never get back. But you must know that the distance from Zanzibar to the\ncoast of Senegal is only thirty-five hundred\u2014say four thousand miles.\nWell, at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every twelve hours, which does\nnot come near the rapidity of our railroad trains, by travelling day and night,\nit would take only seven days to cross Africa!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut then you could see nothing, make no geographical observations, or\nreconnoitre the face of the country.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif I am master of my\nballoon\u2014if I can ascend and descend at will, I shall stop when I please,\nespecially when too violent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way\nwith them.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you will encounter such,\u201d said Captain Bennet. \u201cThere\nare tornadoes that sweep at the rate of more than two hundred and forty miles\nper hour.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou see, then, that with such speed as that, we could cross Africa in\ntwelve hours. One would rise at Zanzibar, and go to bed at St. Louis!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut,\u201d rejoined the officer, \u201ccould any balloon withstand the\nwear and tear of such velocity?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt has happened before,\u201d replied Ferguson.\n \n\u201cAnd the balloon withstood it?\u201d\n \n\u201cPerfectly well. It was at the time of the coronation of Napoleon, in\n1804. The a\u00ebronaut, Gernerin, sent up a balloon at Paris, about eleven\no\u2019clock in the evening. It bore the following inscription, in letters of\ngold: \u2018Paris, 25 Frimaire; year XIII; Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon\nby his Holiness, Pius VII.\u2019 On the next morning, the inhabitants of Rome\nsaw the same balloon soaring above the Vatican, whence it crossed the Campagna,\nand finally fluttered down into the lake of Bracciano. So you see, gentlemen,\nthat a balloon can resist such velocities.\u201d\n \n\u201cA balloon\u2014that might be; but a man?\u201d insinuated Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes, a man, too!\u2014for the balloon is always motionless with\nreference to the air that surrounds it. What moves is the mass of the\natmosphere itself: for instance, one may light a taper in the car, and the\nflame will not even waver. An a\u00ebronaut in Garnerin\u2019s balloon would not\nhave suffered in the least from the speed. But then I have no occasion to\nattempt such velocity; and if I can anchor to some tree, or some favorable\ninequality of the ground, at night, I shall not fail to do so. Besides, we take\nprovision for two months with us, after all; and there is nothing to prevent\nour skilful huntsman here from furnishing game in abundance when we come to\nalight.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! Mr. Kennedy,\u201d said a young midshipman, with envious eyes,\n\u201cwhat splendid shots you\u2019ll have!\u201d\n \n\u201cWithout counting,\u201d said another, \u201cthat you\u2019ll have the\nglory as well as the sport!\u201d\n \n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d replied the hunter, stammering with confusion,\n\u201cI greatly\u2014appreciate\u2014your compliments\u2014but\nthey\u2014don\u2019t\u2014belong to me.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou!\u201d exclaimed every body, \u201cdon\u2019t you intend to\ngo?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am not going!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou won\u2019t accompany Dr. Ferguson?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot only shall I not accompany him, but I am here so as to be present at\nthe last moment to prevent his going.\u201d\n \nEvery eye was now turned to the doctor.\n \n\u201cNever mind him!\u201d said the latter, calmly. \u201cThis is a matter\nthat we can\u2019t argue with him. At heart he knows perfectly well that he\nis going.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy Saint Andrew!\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cI swear\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cSwear to nothing, friend Dick; you have been ganged and\nweighed\u2014you and your powder, your guns, and your bullets; so don\u2019t\nlet us say anything more about it.\u201d\n \nAnd, in fact, from that day until the arrival at Zanzibar, Dick never opened\nhis mouth. He talked neither about that nor about anything else. He kept\nabsolutely silent.\n",

Cape City lying at the foot of an\namphitheatre of hills, could be distinguished through the ship\u2019s glasses,\nand soon the Resolute cast anchor in the port. But the captain touched\nthere only to replenish his coal bunkers, and that was but a day\u2019s job.\nOn the morrow, he steered away to the south\u2019ard, so as to double the\nsouthernmost point of Africa, and enter the Mozambique Channel.\n \nThis was not Joe\u2019s first sea-voyage, and so, for his part, he soon found\nhimself at home on board; every body liked him for his frankness and\ngood-humor. A considerable share of his master\u2019s renown was reflected\nupon him. He was listened to as an oracle, and he made no more mistakes than\nthe next one.\n \nSo, while the doctor was pursuing his descriptive course of lecturing in the\nofficers\u2019 mess, Joe reigned supreme on the forecastle, holding forth in\nhis own peculiar manner, and making history to suit himself\u2014a style of\nprocedure pursued, by the way, by the greatest historians of all ages and\nnations.\n \nThe topic of discourse was, naturally, the a\u00ebrial voyage. Joe had experienced\nsome trouble in getting the rebellious spirits to believe in it; but, once\naccepted by them, nothing connected with it was any longer an impossibility to\nthe imaginations of the seamen stimulated by Joe\u2019s harangues.\n \nOur dazzling narrator persuaded his hearers that, after this trip, many others\nstill more wonderful would be undertaken. In fact, it was to be but the first\nof a long series of superhuman expeditions.\n \n\u201cYou see, my friends, when a man has had a taste of that kind of\ntravelling, he can\u2019t get along afterward with any other; so, on our next\nexpedition, instead of going off to one side, we\u2019ll go right ahead, going\nup, too, all the time.\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! then you\u2019ll go to the moon!\u201d said one of the crowd,\nwith a stare of amazement.\n \n\u201cTo the moon!\u201d exclaimed Joe, \u201cTo the moon! pooh!\nthat\u2019s too common. Every body might go to the moon, that way. Besides,\nthere\u2019s no water there, and you have to carry such a lot of it along with\nyou. Then you have to take air along in bottles, so as to breathe.\u201d\n \n\u201cAy! ay! that\u2019s all right! But can a man get a drop of the real\nstuff there?\u201d said a sailor who liked his toddy.\n \n\u201cNot a drop!\u201d was Joe\u2019s answer. \u201cNo! old fellow, not in\nthe moon. But we\u2019re going to skip round among those little twinklers up\nthere\u2014the stars\u2014and the splendid planets that my old man so often\ntalks about. For instance, we\u2019ll commence with Saturn\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThat one with the ring?\u201d asked the boatswain.\n \n\u201cYes! the wedding-ring\u2014only no one knows what\u2019s become of his\nwife!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat? will you go so high up as that?\u201d said one of the ship-boys,\ngaping with wonder. \u201cWhy, your master must be Old Nick himself.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! no, he\u2019s too good for that.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, after Saturn\u2014what then?\u201d was the next inquiry of his\nimpatient audience.\n \n\u201cAfter Saturn? Well, we\u2019ll visit Jupiter. A funny place that is,\ntoo, where the days are only nine hours and a half long\u2014a good thing for\nthe lazy fellows\u2014and the years, would you believe it\u2014last twelve of\nours, which is fine for folks who have only six months to live. They get off a\nlittle longer by that.\u201d\n \n\u201cTwelve years!\u201d ejaculated the boy.\n \n\u201cYes, my youngster; so that in that country you\u2019d be toddling after\nyour mammy yet, and that old chap yonder, who looks about fifty, would only be\na little shaver of four and a half.\u201d\n \n\u201cBlazes! that\u2019s a good \u2018un!\u201d shouted the whole\nforecastle together.\n \n\u201cSolemn truth!\u201d said Joe, stoutly.\n \n\u201cBut what can you expect? When people will stay in this world, they learn\nnothing and keep as ignorant as bears. But just come along to Jupiter and\nyou\u2019ll see. But they have to look out up there, for he\u2019s got\nsatellites that are not just the easiest things to pass.\u201d\n \nAll the men laughed, but they more than half believed him. Then he went on to\ntalk about Neptune, where seafaring men get a jovial reception, and Mars, where\nthe military get the best of the sidewalk to such an extent that folks can\nhardly stand it. Finally, he drew them a heavenly picture of the delights of\nVenus.\n \n\u201cAnd when we get back from that expedition,\u201d said the indefatigable\nnarrator, \u201cthey\u2019ll decorate us with the Southern Cross that shines\nup there in the Creator\u2019s button-hole.\u201d\n \n\u201cAy, and you\u2019d have well earned it!\u201d said the sailors.\n \nThus passed the long evenings on the forecastle in merry chat, and during the\nsame time the doctor went on with his instructive discourses.\n \nOne day the conversation turned upon the means of directing balloons, and the\ndoctor was asked his opinion about it.\n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d said he, \u201cthat we shall succeed in\nfinding out a system of directing them. I am familiar with all the plans\nattempted and proposed, and not one has succeeded, not one is practicable. You\nmay readily understand that I have occupied my mind with this subject, which\nwas, necessarily, so interesting to me, but I have not been able to solve the\nproblem with the appliances now known to mechanical science. We would have to\ndiscover a motive power of extraordinary force, and almost impossible lightness\nof machinery. And, even then, we could not resist atmospheric currents of any\nconsiderable strength. Until now, the effort has been rather to direct the car\nthan the balloon, and that has been one great error.\u201d\n \n\u201cStill there are many points of resemblance between a balloon and a ship\nwhich is directed at will.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cthere is little or no\nsimilarity between the two cases. Air is infinitely less dense than water, in\nwhich the ship is only half submerged, while the whole bulk of a balloon is\nplunged in the atmosphere, and remains motionless with reference to the element\nthat surrounds it.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou think, then, that aerostatic science has said its last word?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot at all! not at all! But we must look for another point in the case,\nand if we cannot manage to guide our balloon, we must, at least, try to keep it\nin favorable a\u00ebrial currents. In proportion as we ascend, the latter become\nmuch more uniform and flow more constantly in one direction. They are no longer\ndisturbed by the mountains and valleys that traverse the surface of the globe,\nand these, you know, are the chief cause of the variations of the wind and the\ninequality of their force. Therefore, these zones having been once determined,\nthe balloon will merely have to be placed in the currents best adapted to its\ndestination.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut then,\u201d continued Captain Bennet, \u201cin order to reach\nthem, you must keep constantly ascending or descending. That is the real\ndifficulty, doctor.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd why, my dear captain?\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us understand one another. It would be a difficulty and an obstacle\nonly for long journeys, and not for short a\u00ebrial excursions.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd why so, if you please?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause you can ascend only by throwing out ballast; you can descend\nonly after letting off gas, and by these processes your ballast and your gas\nare soon exhausted.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy dear sir, that\u2019s the whole question. There is the only\ndifficulty that science need now seek to overcome. The problem is not how to\nguide the balloon, but how to take it up and down without expending the gas\nwhich is its strength, its life-blood, its soul, if I may use the\nexpression.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are right, my dear doctor; but this problem is not yet solved; this\nmeans has not yet been discovered.\u201d\n \n\u201cI beg your pardon, it has been discovered.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy whom?\u201d\n \n\u201cBy me!\u201d\n \n\u201cBy you?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may readily believe that otherwise I should not have risked this\nexpedition across Africa in a balloon. In twenty-four hours I should have been\nwithout gas!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut you said nothing about that in England?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! I did not want to have myself overhauled in public. I saw no use in\nthat. I made my preparatory experiments in secret and was satisfied. I have no\noccasion, then, to learn any thing more from them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell! doctor, would it be proper to ask what is your secret?\u201d\n \n\u201cHere it is, gentlemen\u2014the simplest thing in the world!\u201d\n \nThe attention of his auditory was now directed to the doctor in the utmost\ndegree as he quietly proceeded with his explanation.\n",
        "\n\nFormer Experiments.\u2014The Doctor\u2019s Five Receptacles.\u2014The Gas\nCylinder.\u2014The Calorifere.\u2014The System of Man\u0153uvring.\u2014Success\ncertain.\n \n\u201cThe attempt has often been made, gentlemen,\u201d said the doctor,\n\u201cto rise and descend at will, without losing ballast or gas from the\nballoon. A French a\u00ebronaut, M. Meunier, tried to accomplish this by compressing\nair in an inner receptacle. A Belgian, Dr. Van Hecke, by means of wings and\npaddles, obtained a vertical power that would have sufficed in most cases, but\nthe practical results secured from these experiments have been insignificant.\n \n\u201cI therefore resolved to go about the thing more directly; so, at the\nstart, I dispensed with ballast altogether, excepting as a provision for cases\nof special emergency, such as the breakage of my apparatus, or the necessity of\nascending very suddenly, so as to avoid unforeseen obstacles.\n \n\u201cMy means of ascent and descent consist simply in dilating or contracting\nthe gas that is in the balloon by the application of different temperatures,\nand here is the method of obtaining that result.\n \n\u201cYou saw me bring on board with the car several cases or receptacles, the\nuse of which you may not have understood. They are five in number.\n \n\u201cThe first contains about twenty-five gallons of water, to which I add a\nfew drops of sulphuric acid, so as to augment its capacity as a conductor of\nelectricity, and then I decompose it by means of a powerful Buntzen battery.\nWater, as you know, consists of two parts of hydrogen to one of oxygen gas.\n \n\u201cThe latter, through the action of the battery, passes at its positive\npole into the second receptacle. A third receptacle, placed above the second\none, and of double its capacity, receives the hydrogen passing into it by the\nnegative pole.\n \n\u201cStopcocks, of which one has an orifice twice the size of the other,\ncommunicate between these receptacles and a fourth one, which is called the\nmixture reservoir, since in it the two gases obtained by the\ndecomposition of the water do really commingle. The capacity of this fourth\ntank is about forty-one cubic feet.\n \n\u201cOn the upper part of this tank is a platinum tube provided with a\nstopcock.\n \n\u201cYou will now readily understand, gentlemen, the apparatus that I have\ndescribed to you is really a gas cylinder and blow-pipe for oxygen and\nhydrogen, the heat of which exceeds that of a forge fire.\n \n\u201cThis much established, I proceed to the second part of my apparatus.\nFrom the lowest part of my balloon, which is hermetically closed, issue two\ntubes a little distance apart. The one starts among the upper layers of the\nhydrogen gas, the other amid the lower layers.\n \n\u201cThese two pipes are provided at intervals with strong jointings of\nindia-rubber, which enable them to move in harmony with the oscillations of the\nballoon.\n \n\u201cBoth of them run down as far as the car, and lose themselves in an iron\nreceptacle of cylindrical form, which is called the heat-tank. The\nlatter is closed at its two ends by two strong plates of the same metal.\n \n\u201cThe pipe running from the lower part of the balloon runs into this\ncylindrical receptacle through the lower plate; it penetrates the latter and\nthen takes the form of a helicoidal or screw-shaped spiral, the rings of which,\nrising one over the other, occupy nearly the whole of the height of the tank.\nBefore again issuing from it, this spiral runs into a small cone with a concave\nbase, that is turned downward in the shape of a spherical cap.\n \n\u201cIt is from the top of this cone that the second pipe issues, and it\nruns, as I have said, into the upper beds of the balloon.\n \n\u201cThe spherical cap of the small cone is of platinum, so as not to melt by\nthe action of the cylinder and blow-pipe, for the latter are placed upon the\nbottom of the iron tank in the midst of the helicoidal spiral, and the\nextremity of their flame will slightly touch the cap in question.\n \n\u201cYou all know, gentlemen, what a calorifere, to heat apartments, is. You\nknow how it acts. The air of the apartments is forced to pass through its\npipes, and is then released with a heightened temperature. Well, what I have\njust described to you is nothing more nor less than a calorifere.\n \n\u201cIn fact, what is it that takes place? The cylinder once lighted, the\nhydrogen in the spiral and in the concave cone becomes heated, and rapidly\nascends through the pipe that leads to the upper part of the balloon. A vacuum\nis created below, and it attracts the gas in the lower parts; this becomes\nheated in its turn, and is continually replaced; thus, an extremely rapid\ncurrent of gas is established in the pipes and in the spiral, which issues from\nthe balloon and then returns to it, and is heated over again, incessantly.\n \n\u201cNow, the cases increase 1/480 of their volume for each degree of heat\napplied. If, then, I force the temperature 18 degrees, the hydrogen of the\nballoon will dilate 18/480 or 1614 cubic feet, and will, therefore, displace\n1614 more cubic feet of air, which will increase its ascensional power by 160\npounds. This is equivalent to throwing out that weight of ballast. If I augment\nthe temperature by 180 degrees, the gas will dilate 180/480 and will displace\n16,740 cubic feet more, and its ascensional force will be augmented by 1,600\npounds.\n \n\u201cThus, you see, gentlemen, that I can easily effect very considerable\nchanges of equilibrium. The volume of the balloon has been calculated in such\nmanner that, when half inflated, it displaces a weight of air exactly equal to\nthat of the envelope containing the hydrogen gas, and of the car occupied by\nthe passengers, and all its apparatus and accessories. At this point of\ninflation, it is in exact equilibrium with the air, and neither mounts nor\ndescends.\n \n\u201cIn order, then, to effect an ascent, I give the gas a temperature\nsuperior to the temperature of the surrounding air by means of my cylinder. By\nthis excess of heat it obtains a larger distention, and inflates the balloon\nmore. The latter, then, ascends in proportion as I heat the hydrogen.\n \n\u201cThe descent, of course, is effected by lowering the heat of the\ncylinder, and letting the temperature abate. The ascent would be, usually, more\nrapid than the descent; but that is a fortunate circumstance, since it is of no\nimportance to me to descend rapidly, while, on the other hand, it is by a very\nrapid ascent that I avoid obstacles. The real danger lurks below, and not\nabove.\n \n\u201cBesides, as I have said, I have a certain quantity of ballast, which\nwill enable me to ascend more rapidly still, when necessary. My valve, at the\ntop of the balloon, is nothing more nor less than a safety-valve. The balloon\nalways retains the same quantity of hydrogen, and the variations of temperature\nthat I produce in the midst of this shut-up gas are, of themselves, sufficient\nto provide for all these ascending and descending movements.\n \n\u201cNow, gentlemen, as a practical detail, let me add this:\n \n\u201cThe combustion of the hydrogen and of the oxygen at the point of the\ncylinder produces solely the vapor or steam of water. I have, therefore,\nprovided the lower part of the cylindrical iron box with a scape-pipe, with a\nvalve operating by means of a pressure of two atmospheres; consequently, so\nsoon as this amount of pressure is attained, the steam escapes of itself.\n \n\u201cHere are the exact figures: 25 gallons of water, separated into its\nconstituent elements, yield 200 pounds of oxygen and 25 pounds of hydrogen.\nThis represents, at atmospheric tension, 1,800 cubic feet of the former and\n3,780 cubic feet of the latter, or 5,670 cubic feet, in all, of the mixture.\nHence, the stopcock of my cylinder, when fully open, expends 27 cubic feet per\nhour, with a flame at least six times as strong as that of the large lamps used\nfor lighting streets. On an average, then, and in order to keep myself at a\nvery moderate elevation, I should not burn more than nine cubic feet per hour,\nso that my twenty-five gallons of water represent six hundred and thirty-six\nhours of a\u00ebrial navigation, or a little more than twenty-six days.\n \n\u201cWell, as I can descend when I please, to replenish my stock of water on\nthe way, my trip might be indefinitely prolonged.\n \n\u201cSuch, gentlemen, is my secret. It is simple, and, like most simple\nthings, it cannot fail to succeed. The dilation and contraction of the gas in\nthe balloon is my means of locomotion, which calls for neither cumbersome\nwings, nor any other mechanical motor. A calorifere to produce the changes of\ntemperature, and a cylinder to generate the heat, are neither inconvenient nor\nheavy. I think, therefore, that I have combined all the elements of\nsuccess.\u201d\n \nDr. Ferguson here terminated his discourse, and was most heartily applauded.\nThere was not an objection to make to it; all had been foreseen and decided.\n \n\u201cHowever,\u201d said the captain, \u201cthe thing may prove\ndangerous.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat matters that,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cprovided that it be\npracticable?\u201d\n",

The navigation of the\nMozambique Channel was especially calm and pleasant. The agreeable character of\nthe trip by sea was regarded as a good omen of the probable issue of the trip\nthrough the air. Every one looked forward to the hour of arrival, and sought to\ngive the last touch to the doctor\u2019s preparations.\n \nAt length the vessel hove in sight of the town of Zanzibar, upon the island of\nthe same name, and, on the 15th of April, at 11 o\u2019clock in the morning,\nshe anchored in the port.\n \nThe island of Zanzibar belongs to the Imaum of Muscat, an ally of France and\nEngland, and is, undoubtedly, his finest settlement. The port is frequented by\na great many vessels from the neighboring countries.\n \nThe island is separated from the African coast only by a channel, the greatest\nwidth of which is but thirty miles.\n \nIt has a large trade in gums, ivory, and, above all, in \u201cebony,\u201d\nfor Zanzibar is the great slave-market. Thither converges all the booty\ncaptured in the battles which the chiefs of the interior are continually\nfighting. This traffic extends along the whole eastern coast, and as far as the\nNile latitudes. Mr. G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it carried on,\nopenly, under the French flag.\n \nUpon the arrival of the Resolute, the English consul at Zanzibar came on\nboard to offer his services to the doctor, of whose projects the European\nnewspapers had made him aware for a month past. But, up to that moment, he had\nremained with the numerous phalanx of the incredulous.\n \n\u201cI doubted,\u201d said he, holding out his hand to Dr. Ferguson,\n\u201cbut now I doubt no longer.\u201d\n \nHe invited the doctor, Kennedy, and the faithful Joe, of course, to his own\ndwelling. Through his courtesy, the doctor was enabled to have knowledge of the\nvarious letters that he had received from Captain Speke. The captain and his\ncompanions had suffered dreadfully from hunger and bad weather before reaching\nthe Ugogo country. They could advance only with extreme difficulty, and did not\nexpect to be able to communicate again for a long time.\n \n\u201cThose are perils and privations which we shall manage to avoid,\u201d\nsaid the doctor.\n \nThe baggage of the three travellers was conveyed to the consul\u2019s\nresidence. Arrangements were made for disembarking the balloon upon the beach\nat Zanzibar. There was a convenient spot, near the signal-mast, close by an\nimmense building, that would serve to shelter it from the east winds. This huge\ntower, resembling a tun standing on one end, beside which the famous Heidelberg\ntun would have seemed but a very ordinary barrel, served as a fortification,\nand on its platform were stationed Belootchees, armed with lances. These\nBelootchees are a kind of brawling, good-for-nothing Janizaries.\n \nBut, when about to land the balloon, the consul was informed that the\npopulation of the island would oppose their doing so by force. Nothing is so\nblind as fanatical passion. The news of the arrival of a Christian, who was to\nascend into the air, was received with rage. The negroes, more exasperated than\nthe Arabs, saw in this project an attack upon their religion. They took it into\ntheir heads that some mischief was meant to the sun and the moon. Now, these\ntwo luminaries are objects of veneration to the African tribes, and they\ndetermined to oppose so sacrilegious an enterprise.\n \nThe consul, informed of their intentions, conferred with Dr. Ferguson and\nCaptain Bennet on the subject. The latter was unwilling to yield to threats,\nbut his friend dissuaded him from any idea of violent retaliation.\n \n\u201cWe shall certainly come out winners,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the\nimaum\u2019s soldiers will lend us a hand, if we need it. But, my dear\ncaptain, an accident may happen in a moment, and it would require but one\nunlucky blow to do the balloon an irreparable injury, so that the trip would be\ntotally defeated; therefore we must act with the greatest caution.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what are we to do? If we land on the coast of Africa, we shall\nencounter the same difficulties. What are we to do?\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing is more simple,\u201d replied the consul. \u201cYou observe\nthose small islands outside of the port; land your balloon on one of them;\nsurround it with a guard of sailors, and you will have no risk to run.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust the thing!\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand we shall be entirely\nat our ease in completing our preparations.\u201d\n \nThe captain yielded to these suggestions, and the Resolute was headed\nfor the island of Koumbeni. During the morning of the 16th April, the balloon\nwas placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great woods, with which\nthe soil is studded.\n \nTwo masts, eighty feet in height, were raised at the same distance from each\nother. Blocks and tackle, placed at their extremities, afforded the means of\nelevating the balloon, by the aid of a transverse rope. It was then entirely\nuninflated. The interior balloon was fastened to the exterior one, in such\nmanner as to be lifted up in the same way. To the lower end of each balloon\nwere fixed the pipes that served to introduce the hydrogen gas.\n \nThe whole day, on the 17th, was spent in arranging the apparatus destined to\nproduce the gas; it consisted of some thirty casks, in which the decomposition\nof water was effected by means of iron-filings and sulphuric acid placed\ntogether in a large quantity of the first-named fluid. The hydrogen passed into\na huge central cask, after having been washed on the way, and thence into each\nballoon by the conduit-pipes. In this manner each of them received a certain\naccurately-ascertained quantity of gas. For this purpose, there had to be\nemployed eighteen hundred and sixty-six pounds of sulphuric acid, sixteen\nthousand and fifty pounds of iron, and nine thousand one hundred and sixty-six\ngallons of water. This operation commenced on the following night, about three\nA.M., and lasted nearly eight hours. The next day, the balloon, covered with\nits network, undulated gracefully above its car, which was held to the ground\nby numerous sacks of earth. The inflating apparatus was put together with\nextreme care, and the pipes issuing from the balloon were securely fitted to\nthe cylindrical case.\n \nThe anchors, the cordage, the instruments, the travelling-wraps, the awning,\nthe provisions, and the arms, were put in the place assigned to them in the\ncar. The supply of water was procured at Zanzibar. The two hundred pounds of\nballast were distributed in fifty bags placed at the bottom of the car, but\nwithin arm\u2019s-reach.\n \nThese preparations were concluded about five o\u2019clock in the evening,\nwhile sentinels kept close watch around the island, and the boats of the\nResolute patrolled the channel.\n \nThe blacks continued to show their displeasure by grimaces and contortions.\nTheir obi-men, or wizards, went up and down among the angry throngs,\npouring fuel on the flame of their fanaticism; and some of the excited\nwretches, more furious and daring than the rest, attempted to get to the island\nby swimming, but they were easily driven off.\n \nThereupon the sorceries and incantations commenced; the\n\u201crain-makers,\u201d who pretend to have control over the clouds, invoked\nthe storms and the \u201cstone-showers,\u201d as the blacks call hail, to\ntheir aid. To compel them to do so, they plucked leaves of all the different\ntrees that grow in that country, and boiled them over a slow fire, while, at\nthe same time, a sheep was killed by thrusting a long needle into its heart.\nBut, in spite of all their ceremonies, the sky remained clear and beautiful,\nand they profited nothing by their slaughtered sheep and their ugly grimaces.\n \nThe blacks then abandoned themselves to the most furious orgies, and got\nfearfully drunk on \u201ctembo,\u201d a kind of ardent spirits drawn from the\ncocoa-nut tree, and an extremely heady sort of beer called \u201ctogwa.\u201d\nTheir chants, which were destitute of all melody, but were sung in excellent\ntime, continued until far into the night.\n \nAbout six o\u2019clock in the evening, the captain assembled the travellers\nand the officers of the ship at a farewell repast in his cabin. Kennedy, whom\nnobody ventured to question now, sat with his eyes riveted on Dr. Ferguson,\nmurmuring indistinguishable words. In other respects, the dinner was a gloomy\none. The approach of the final moment filled everybody with the most serious\nreflections. What had fate in store for these daring adventurers? Should they\never again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the\ndomestic hearth? Were their travelling apparatus to fail, what would become of\nthem, among those ferocious savage tribes, in regions that had never been\nexplored, and in the midst of boundless deserts?\n \nSuch thoughts as these, which had been dim and vague until then, or but\nslightly regarded when they came up, returned upon their excited fancies with\nintense force at this parting moment. Dr. Ferguson, still cold and impassible,\ntalked of this, that, and the other; but he strove in vain to overcome this\ninfectious gloominess. He utterly failed.\n \nAs some demonstration against the personal safety of the doctor and his\ncompanions was feared, all three slept that night on board the Resolute.\nAt six o\u2019clock in the morning they left their cabin, and landed on the\nisland of Koumbeni.\n \nThe balloon was swaying gently to and fro in the morning breeze; the sand-bags\nthat had held it down were now replaced by some twenty strong-armed sailors,\nand Captain Bennet and his officers were present to witness the solemn\ndeparture of their friends.\n \nAt this moment Kennedy went right up to the doctor, grasped his hand, and said:\n \n\u201cSamuel, have you absolutely determined to go?\u201d\n \n\u201cSolemnly determined, my dear Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cI have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I\nnot?\u201d\n \n\u201cEvery thing!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, my conscience is clear on that score, and I will go with\nyou.\u201d\n \n\u201cI was sure you would!\u201d said the doctor, betraying in his features\nswift traces of emotion.\n \nAt last the moment of final leave-taking arrived. The captain and his officers\nembraced their dauntless friends with great feeling, not excepting even Joe,\nwho, worthy fellow, was as proud and happy as a prince. Every one in the party\ninsisted upon having a final shake of the doctor\u2019s hand.\n \nAt nine o\u2019clock the three travellers got into their car. The doctor lit\nthe combustible in his cylinder and turned the flame so as to produce a rapid\nheat, and the balloon, which had rested on the ground in perfect equipoise,\nbegan to rise in a few minutes, so that the seamen had to slacken the ropes\nthey held it by. The car then rose about twenty feet above their heads.\n \n\u201cMy friends!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, standing up between his two\ncompanions, and taking off his hat, \u201clet us give our a\u00ebrial ship a name\nthat will bring her good luck! let us christen her Victoria!\u201d\n \nThis speech was answered with stentorian cheers of \u201cHuzza for the Queen!\nHuzza for Old England!\u201d\n \nAt this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased prodigiously, and\nFerguson, Kennedy, and Joe, waved a last good-by to their friends.\n \n\u201cLet go all!\u201d shouted the doctor, and at the word the\nVictoria shot rapidly up into the sky, while the four carronades on\nboard the Resolute thundered forth a parting salute in her honor.\n",

The island of Zanzibar could be seen in its entire extent, marked\nout by its deeper color upon a vast planisphere; the fields had the appearance\nof patterns of different colors, and thick clumps of green indicated the groves\nand thickets.\n \nThe inhabitants of the island looked no larger than insects. The huzzaing and\nshouting were little by little lost in the distance, and only the discharge of\nthe ship\u2019s guns could be heard in the concavity beneath the balloon, as\nthe latter sped on its flight.\n \n\u201cHow fine that is!\u201d said Joe, breaking silence for the first time.\n \nHe got no reply. The doctor was busy observing the variations of the barometer\nand noting down the details of his ascent.\n \nKennedy looked on, and had not eyes enough to take in all that he saw.\n \nThe rays of the sun coming to the aid of the heating cylinder, the tension of\nthe gas increased, and the Victoria attained the height of twenty-five\nhundred feet.\n \nThe Resolute looked like a mere cockle-shell, and the African coast\ncould be distinctly seen in the west marked out by a fringe of foam.\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t talk?\u201d said Joe, again.\n \n\u201cWe are looking!\u201d said the doctor, directing his spy-glass toward\nthe mainland.\n \n\u201cFor my part, I must talk!\u201d\n \n\u201cAs much as you please, Joe; talk as much as you like!\u201d\n \nAnd Joe went on alone with a tremendous volley of exclamations. The\n\u201cohs!\u201d and the \u201cahs!\u201d exploded one after the other,\nincessantly, from his lips.\n \nDuring his passage over the sea the doctor deemed it best to keep at his\npresent elevation. He could thus reconnoitre a greater stretch of the coast.\nThe thermometer and the barometer, hanging up inside of the half-opened awning,\nwere always within sight, and a second barometer suspended outside was to serve\nduring the night watches.\n \nAt the end of about two hours the Victoria, driven along at a speed of a\nlittle more than eight miles, very visibly neared the coast of the mainland.\nThe doctor, thereupon, determined to descend a little nearer to the ground. So\nhe moderated the flame of his cylinder, and the balloon, in a few moments, had\ndescended to an altitude only three hundred feet above the soil.\n \nIt was then found to be passing just over the Mrima country, the name of this\npart of the eastern coast of Africa. Dense borders of mango-trees protected its\nmargin, and the ebb-tide disclosed to view their thick roots, chafed and gnawed\nby the teeth of the Indian Ocean. The sands which, at an earlier period, formed\nthe coast-line, rounded away along the distant horizon, and Mount Nguru reared\naloft its sharp summit in the northwest.\n \nThe Victoria passed near to a village which the doctor found marked upon\nhis chart as Kaole. Its entire population had assembled in crowds, and were\nyelling with anger and fear, at the same time vainly directing their arrows\nagainst this monster of the air that swept along so majestically away above all\ntheir powerless fury.\n \nThe wind was setting to the southward, but the doctor felt no concern on that\nscore, since it enabled him the better to follow the route traced by Captains\nBurton and Speke.\n \nKennedy had, at length, become as talkative as Joe, and the two kept up a\ncontinual interchange of admiring interjections and exclamations.\n \n\u201cOut upon stage-coaches!\u201d said one.\n \n\u201cSteamers indeed!\u201d said the other.\n \n\u201cRailroads! eh? rubbish!\u201d put in Kennedy, \u201cthat you travel\non, without seeing the country!\u201d\n \n\u201cBalloons! they\u2019re the sort for me!\u201d Joe would add.\n\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t feel yourself going, and Nature takes the trouble\nto spread herself out before one\u2019s eyes!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat a splendid sight! What a spectacle! What a delight! a dream in a\nhammock!\u201d\n \n\u201cSuppose we take our breakfast?\u201d was Joe\u2019s unpoetical change\nof tune, at last, for the keen, open air had mightily sharpened his appetite.\n \n\u201cGood idea, my boy!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! it won\u2019t take us long to do the cooking\u2014biscuit and\npotted meat?\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd as much coffee as you like,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cI give\nyou leave to borrow a little heat from my cylinder. There\u2019s enough and to\nspare, for that matter, and so we shall avoid the risk of a\nconflagration.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat would be a dreadful misfortune!\u201d ejaculated Kennedy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as a powder-magazine suspended over our\nheads.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot precisely,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201cbut still if the gas were to\ntake fire it would burn up gradually, and we should settle down on the ground,\nwhich would be disagreeable; but never fear\u2014our balloon is hermetically\nsealed.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us eat a bite, then,\u201d replied Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNow, gentlemen,\u201d put in Joe, \u201cwhile doing the same as you,\nI\u2019m going to get you up a cup of coffee that I think you\u2019ll have\nsomething to say about.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cthat Joe, along with a\nthousand other virtues, has a remarkable talent for the preparation of that\ndelicious beverage: he compounds it of a mixture of various origin, but he\nnever would reveal to me the ingredients.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, master, since we are so far above-ground, I can tell you the\nsecret. It is just to mix equal quantities of Mocha, of Bourbon coffee, and of\nRio Nunez.\u201d\n \nA few moments later, three steaming cups of coffee were served, and topped off\na substantial breakfast, which was additionally seasoned by the jokes and\nrepartees of the guests. Each one then resumed his post of observation.\n \nThe country over which they were passing was remarkable for its fertility.\nNarrow, winding paths plunged in beneath the overarching verdure. They swept\nalong above cultivated fields of tobacco, maize, and barley, at full maturity,\nand here and there immense rice-fields, full of straight stalks and purple\nblossoms. They could distinguish sheep and goats too, confined in large cages,\nset up on piles to keep them out of reach of the leopards\u2019 fangs.\nLuxuriant vegetation spread in wild profuseness over this prodigal soil.\n \nVillage after village rang with yells of terror and astonishment at the sight\nof the Victoria, and Dr. Ferguson prudently kept her above the reach of\nthe barbarian arrows. The savages below, thus baffled, ran together from their\nhuddle of huts and followed the travellers with their vain imprecations while\nthey remained in sight.\n \nAt noon, the doctor, upon consulting his map, calculated that they were passing\nover the Uzaramo[2]\ncountry. The soil was thickly studded with cocoa-nut, papaw, and cotton-wood\ntrees, above which the balloon seemed to disport itself like a bird. Joe found\nthis splendid vegetation a matter of course, seeing that they were in Africa.\nKennedy descried some hares and quails that asked nothing better than to get a\ngood shot from his fowling-piece, but it would have been powder wasted, since\nthere was no time to pick up the game.\n \n [2]\nU and Ou signify country in the language of that region.\n \nThe a\u00ebronauts swept on with the speed of twelve miles per hour, and soon were\npassing in thirty-eight degrees twenty minutes east longitude, over the village\nof Tounda.\n \n\u201cIt was there,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthat Burton and Speke were\nseized with violent fevers, and for a moment thought their expedition ruined.\nAnd yet they were only a short distance from the coast, but fatigue and\nprivation were beginning to tell upon them severely.\u201d\n \nIn fact, there is a perpetual malaria reigning throughout the country in\nquestion. Even the doctor could hope to escape its effects only by rising above\nthe range of the miasma that exhales from this damp region whence the blazing\nrays of the sun pump up its poisonous vapors. Once in a while they could descry\na caravan resting in a \u201ckraal,\u201d awaiting the freshness and\ncool of the evening to resume its route. These kraals are wide patches of\ncleared land, surrounded by hedges and jungles, where traders take shelter\nagainst not only the wild beasts, but also the robber tribes of the country.\nThey could see the natives running and scattering in all directions at the\nsight of the Victoria. Kennedy was keen to get a closer look at them,\nbut the doctor invariably held out against the idea.\n \n\u201cThe chiefs are armed with muskets,\u201d he said, \u201cand our\nballoon would be too conspicuous a mark for their bullets.\u201d\n \n\u201cWould a bullet-hole bring us down?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cNot immediately; but such a hole would soon become a large torn orifice\nthrough which our gas would escape.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, let us keep at a respectful distance from yon miscreants. What\nmust they think as they see us sailing in the air? I\u2019m sure they must\nfeel like worshipping us!\u201d\n \n\u201cLet them worship away, then,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cbut at a\ndistance. There is no harm done in getting as far away from them as possible.\nSee! the country is already changing its aspect: the villages are fewer and\nfarther between; the mango-trees have disappeared, for their growth ceases at\nthis latitude. The soil is becoming hilly and portends mountains not far\noff.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cit seems to me that I can see some high\nland on this side.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the west\u2014those are the nearest ranges of the\nOurizara\u2014Mount Duthumi, no doubt, behind which I hope to find shelter for\nthe night. I\u2019ll stir up the heat in the cylinder a little, for we must\nkeep at an elevation of five or six hundred feet.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat was a grand idea of yours, sir,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt\u2019s\nmighty easy to manage it; you turn a cock, and the thing\u2019s done.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! here we are more at our ease,\u201d said the sportsman, as the\nballoon ascended; \u201cthe reflection of the sun on those red sands was\ngetting to be insupportable.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat splendid trees!\u201d cried Joe. \u201cThey\u2019re quite\nnatural, but they are very fine! Why a dozen of them would make a\nforest!\u201d\n \n\u201cThose are baobabs,\u201d replied Dr. Ferguson. \u201cSee,\nthere\u2019s one with a trunk fully one hundred feet in circumference. It was,\nperhaps, at the foot of that very tree that Maizan, the French traveller,\nexpired in 1845, for we are over the village of Deje-la-Mhora, to which he\npushed on alone. He was seized by the chief of this region, fastened to the\nfoot of a baobab, and the ferocious black then severed all his joints while the\nwar-song of his tribe was chanted; he then made a gash in the prisoner\u2019s\nneck, stopped to sharpen his knife, and fairly tore away the poor\nwretch\u2019s head before it had been cut from the body. The unfortunate\nFrenchman was but twenty-six years of age.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd France has never avenged so hideous a crime?\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cFrance did demand satisfaction, and the Said of Zanzibar did all in his\npower to capture the murderer, but in vain.\u201d\n \n\u201cI move that we don\u2019t stop here!\u201d urged Joe; \u201clet us go\nup, master, let us go up higher by all means.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll the more willingly, Joe, that there is Mount Duthumi right ahead of\nus. If my calculations be right we shall have passed it before seven\no\u2019clock in the evening.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we not travel at night?\u201d asked the Scotchman.\n \n\u201cNo, as little as possible. With care and vigilance we might do so\nsafely, but it is not enough to sweep across Africa. We want to see it.\u201d\n \n\u201cUp to this time we have nothing to complain of, master. The best\ncultivated and most fertile country in the world instead of a desert! Believe\nthe geographers after that!\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us wait, Joe! we shall see by-and-by.\u201d\n \nAbout half-past six in the evening the Victoria was directly opposite\nMount Duthumi; in order to pass, it had to ascend to a height of more than\nthree thousand feet, and to accomplish that the doctor had only to raise the\ntemperature of his gas eighteen degrees. It might have been correctly said that\nhe held his balloon in his hand. Kennedy had only to indicate to him the\nobstacles to be surmounted, and the Victoria sped through the air,\nskimming the summits of the range.\n \nAt eight o\u2019clock it descended the farther slope, the acclivity of which\nwas much less abrupt. The anchors were thrown out from the car and one of them,\ncoming in contact with the branches of an enormous nopal, caught on it firmly.\nJoe at once let himself slide down the rope and secured it. The silk ladder was\nthen lowered to him and he remounted to the car with agility. The balloon now\nremained perfectly at rest sheltered from the eastern winds.\n \nThe evening meal was got ready, and the a\u00ebronauts, excited by their day\u2019s\njourney, made a heavy onslaught upon the provisions.\n \n\u201cWhat distance have we traversed to-day?\u201d asked Kennedy, disposing\nof some alarming mouthfuls.\n \nThe doctor took his bearings, by means of lunar observations, and consulted the\nexcellent map that he had with him for his guidance. It belonged to the Atlas\nof \u201cDer Neuester Endeckungen in Afrika\u201d (\u201cThe Latest\nDiscoveries in Africa\u201d), published at Gotha by his learned friend Dr.\nPetermann, and by that savant sent to him. This Atlas was to serve the\ndoctor on his whole journey; for it contained the itinerary of Burton and Speke\nto the great lakes; the Soudan, according to Dr. Barth; the Lower Senegal,\naccording to Guillaume Lejean; and the Delta of the Niger, by Dr. Blaikie.\n \nFerguson had also provided himself with a work which combined in one\ncompilation all the notions already acquired concerning the Nile. It was\nentitled \u201cThe Sources of the Nile; being a General Survey of the Basin of\nthat River and of its Head-Stream, with the History of the Nilotic Discovery,\nby Charles Beke, D.D.\u201d\n \nHe also had the excellent charts published in the \u201cBulletins of the\nGeographical Society of London;\u201d and not a single point of the countries\nalready discovered could, therefore, escape his notice.\n \nUpon tracing on his maps, he found that his latitudinal route had been two\ndegrees, or one hundred and twenty miles, to the westward.\n \nKennedy remarked that the route tended toward the south; but this direction was\nsatisfactory to the doctor, who desired to reconnoitre the tracks of his\npredecessors as much as possible. It was agreed that the night should be\ndivided into three watches, so that each of the party should take his turn in\nwatching over the safety of the rest. The doctor took the watch commencing at\nnine o\u2019clock; Kennedy, the one commencing at midnight; and Joe, the three\no\u2019clock morning watch.\n \nSo Kennedy and Joe, well wrapped in their blankets, stretched themselves at\nfull length under the awning, and slept quietly; while Dr. Ferguson kept on the\nlookout.\n",
        "\n\nChange of Weather.\u2014Kennedy has the Fever.\u2014The Doctor\u2019s\nMedicine.\u2014Travels on Land.\u2014The Basin of Imenge.\u2014Mount\nRubeho.\u2014Six Thousand Feet Elevation.\u2014A Halt in the Daytime.\n \nThe night was calm. However, on Saturday morning, Kennedy, as he awoke,\ncomplained of lassitude and feverish chills. The weather was changing. The sky,\ncovered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a fresh deluge. A\ngloomy region is that Zungomoro country, where it rains continually, excepting,\nperhaps, for a couple of weeks in the month of January.\n \nA violent shower was not long in drenching our travellers. Below them, the\nroads, intersected by \u201cnullahs,\u201d a sort of instantaneous torrent,\nwere soon rendered impracticable, entangled as they were, besides, with thorny\nthickets and gigantic lianas, or creeping vines. The sulphuretted hydrogen\nemanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly smelt.\n \n\u201cAccording to his statement, and I think he\u2019s right,\u201d said\nthe doctor, \u201cone could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden\nbehind every thicket.\u201d\n \n\u201cAn ugly country this!\u201d sighed Joe; \u201cand it seems to me that\nMr. Kennedy is none the better for having passed the night in it.\u201d\n \n\u201cTo tell the truth, I have quite a high fever,\u201d said the sportsman.\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in\none of the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here long;\nso let\u2019s be off.\u201d\n \nThanks to a skilful man\u0153uvre achieved by Joe, the anchor was disengaged, and\nJoe reascended to the car by means of the ladder. The doctor vigorously dilated\nthe gas, and the Victoria resumed her flight, driven along by a spanking\nbreeze.\n \nOnly a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists; but the\nappearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in Africa that\nsome of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others that are perfectly\nsalubrious.\n \nKennedy was visibly suffering, and the fever was mastering his vigorous\nconstitution.\n \n\u201cIt won\u2019t do to fall ill, though,\u201d he grumbled; and so\nsaying, he wrapped himself in a blanket, and lay down under the awning.\n \n\u201cA little patience, Dick, and you\u2019ll soon get over this,\u201d\nsaid the doctor.\n \n\u201cGet over it! Egad, Samuel, if you\u2019ve any drug in your\ntravelling-chest that will set me on my feet again, bring it without delay.\nI\u2019ll swallow it with my eyes shut!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, I can do better than that, friend Dick; for I can give you a\nfebrifuge that won\u2019t cost any thing.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd how will you do that?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery easily. I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that\nare now deluging us, and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere. I ask\nfor only ten minutes, in order to dilate the hydrogen.\u201d\n \nThe ten minutes had scarcely elapsed ere the travellers were beyond the rainy\nbelt of country.\n \n\u201cWait a little, now, Dick, and you\u2019ll begin to feel the effect of\npure air and sunshine.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a cure for you!\u201d said Joe; \u201cwhy, it\u2019s\nwonderful!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s merely natural.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! natural; yes, no doubt of that!\u201d\n \n\u201cI bring Dick into good air, as the doctors do, every day, in Europe, or,\nas I would send a patient at Martinique to the Pitons, a lofty mountain on that\nisland, to get clear of the yellow fever.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! by Jove, this balloon is a paradise!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy,\nfeeling much better already.\n \n\u201cIt leads to it, anyhow!\u201d replied Joe, quite gravely.\n \nIt was a curious spectacle\u2014that mass of clouds piled up, at the moment,\naway below them! The vapors rolled over each other, and mingled together in\nconfused masses of superb brilliance, as they reflected the rays of the sun.\nThe Victoria had attained an altitude of four thousand feet, and the\nthermometer indicated a certain diminution of temperature. The land below could\nno longer be seen. Fifty miles away to the westward, Mount Rubeho raised its\nsparkling crest, marking the limit of the Ugogo country in east longitude\nthirty-six degrees twenty minutes. The wind was blowing at the rate of twenty\nmiles an hour, but the a\u00ebronauts felt nothing of this increased speed. They\nobserved no jar, and had scarcely any sense of motion at all.\n \nThree hours later, the doctor\u2019s prediction was fully verified. Kennedy no\nlonger felt a single shiver of the fever, but partook of some breakfast with an\nexcellent appetite.\n \n\u201cThat beats sulphate of quinine!\u201d said the energetic Scot, with\nhearty emphasis and much satisfaction.\n \n\u201cPositively,\u201d said Joe, \u201cthis is where I\u2019ll have to\nretire to when I get old!\u201d\n \nAbout ten o\u2019clock in the morning the atmosphere cleared up, the clouds\nparted, and the country beneath could again be seen, the Victoria\nmeanwhile rapidly descending. Dr. Ferguson was in search of a current that\nwould carry him more to the northeast, and he found it about six hundred feet\nfrom the ground. The country was becoming more broken, and even mountainous.\nThe Zungomoro district was fading out of sight in the east with the last\ncocoa-nut-trees of that latitude.\n \nEre long, the crests of a mountain-range assumed a more decided prominence. A\nfew peaks rose here and there, and it became necessary to keep a sharp lookout\nfor the pointed cones that seemed to spring up every moment.\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re right among the breakers!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cKeep cool, Dick. We shan\u2019t touch them,\u201d was the\ndoctor\u2019s quiet answer.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a jolly way to travel, anyhow!\u201d said Joe, with his\nusual flow of spirits.\n \nIn fact, the doctor managed his balloon with wondrous dexterity.\n \n\u201cNow, if we had been compelled to go afoot over that drenched\nsoil,\u201d said he, \u201cwe should still be dragging along in a\npestilential mire. Since our departure from Zanzibar, half our beasts of burden\nwould have died with fatigue. We should be looking like ghosts ourselves, and\ndespair would be seizing on our hearts. We should be in continual squabbles\nwith our guides and porters, and completely exposed to their unbridled\nbrutality. During the daytime, a damp, penetrating, unendurable humidity! At\nnight, a cold frequently intolerable, and the stings of a kind of fly whose\nbite pierces the thickest cloth, and drives the victim crazy! All this, too,\nwithout saying any thing about wild beasts and ferocious native tribes!\u201d\n \n\u201cI move that we don\u2019t try it!\u201d said Joe, in his droll way.\n \n\u201cI exaggerate nothing,\u201d continued Ferguson, \u201cfor, upon\nreading the narratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture\ninto these regions, your eyes would fill with tears.\u201d\n \nAbout eleven o\u2019clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the\ntribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the\nVictoria with their weapons. Finally, she sped along as far as the last\nundulations of the country which precede Rubeho. These form the last and\nloftiest chain of the mountains of Usagara.\n \nThe a\u00ebronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic conformation of\nthe country. The three ramifications mentioned, of which the Duthumi forms the\nfirst link, are separated by immense longitudinal plains. These elevated\nsummits consist of rounded cones, between which the soil is bestrewn with\nerratic blocks of stone and gravelly bowlders. The most abrupt declivity of\nthese mountains confronts the Zanzibar coast, but the western slopes are merely\ninclined planes. The depressions in the soil are covered with a black, rich\nloam, on which there is a vigorous vegetation. Various water-courses filter\nthrough, toward the east, and work their way onward to flow into the Kingani,\nin the midst of gigantic clumps of sycamore, tamarind, calabash, and palmyra\ntrees.\n \n\u201cAttention!\u201d said Dr. Ferguson. \u201cWe are approaching Rubeho,\nthe name of which signifies, in the language of the country, the \u2018Passage\nof the Winds,\u2019 and we would do well to double its jagged pinnacles at a\ncertain height. If my chart be exact, we are going to ascend to an elevation of\nfive thousand feet.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the\natmosphere?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery seldom: the height of the African mountains appears to be quite\nmoderate compared with that of the European and Asiatic ranges; but, in any\ncase, our good Victoria will find no difficulty in passing over\nthem.\u201d\n \nIn a very little while, the gas expanded under the action of the heat, and the\nballoon took a very decided ascensional movement. Besides, the dilation of the\nhydrogen involved no danger, and only three-fourths of the vast capacity of the\nballoon was filled when the barometer, by a depression of eight inches,\nannounced an elevation of six thousand feet.\n \n\u201cShall we go this high very long?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cThe atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms,\u201d\nsaid the doctor; \u201cand, with a very large balloon, one might go far. That\nis what Messrs. Brioschi and Gay-Lussac did; but then the blood burst from\ntheir mouths and ears. Respirable air was wanting. Some years ago, two fearless\nFrenchmen, Messrs. Barral and Bixio, also ventured into the very lofty regions;\nbut their balloon burst\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd they fell?\u201d asked Kennedy, abruptly.\n \n\u201cCertainly they did; but as learned men should always fall\u2014namely,\nwithout hurting themselves.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d said Joe, \u201cyou may try their fall over\nagain, if you like; but, as for me, who am but a dolt, I prefer keeping at the\nmedium height\u2014neither too far up, nor too low down. It won\u2019t do to\nbe too ambitious.\u201d\n \nAt the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has already\ngreatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the voice is not so\neasily heard. The view of objects becomes confused; the gaze no longer takes in\nany but large, quite ill-distinguishable masses; men and animals on the surface\nbecome absolutely invisible; the roads and rivers get to look like threads, and\nthe lakes dwindle to ponds.\n \nThe doctor and his friends felt themselves in a very anomalous condition; an\natmospheric current of extreme velocity was bearing them away beyond arid\nmountains, upon whose summits vast fields of snow surprised the gaze; while\ntheir convulsed appearance told of Titanic travail in the earliest epoch of the\nworld\u2019s existence.\n \nThe sun shone at the zenith, and his rays fell perpendicularly upon those\nlonely summits. The doctor took an accurate design of these mountains, which\nform four distinct ridges almost in a straight line, the northernmost being the\nlongest.\n \nThe Victoria soon descended the slope opposite to the Rubeho, skirting\nan acclivity covered with woods, and dotted with trees of very deep-green\nfoliage. Then came crests and ravines, in a sort of desert which preceded the\nUgogo country; and lower down were yellow plains, parched and fissured by the\nintense heat, and, here and there, bestrewn with saline plants and brambly\nthickets.\n \nSome underbrush, which, farther on, became forests, embellished the horizon.\nThe doctor went nearer to the ground; the anchors were thrown out, and one of\nthem soon caught in the boughs of a huge sycamore.\n \nJoe, slipping nimbly down the tree, carefully attached the anchor, and the\ndoctor left his cylinder at work to a certain degree in order to retain\nsufficient ascensional force in the balloon to keep it in the air. Meanwhile\nthe wind had suddenly died away.\n \n\u201cNow,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201ctake two guns, friend Dick\u2014one\nfor yourself and one for Joe\u2014and both of you try to bring back some nice\ncuts of antelope-meat; they will make us a good dinner.\u201d\n \n\u201cOff to the hunt!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, joyously.\n \nHe climbed briskly out of the car and descended. Joe had swung himself down\nfrom branch to branch, and was waiting for him below, stretching his limbs in\nthe mean time.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t fly away without us, doctor!\u201d shouted Joe.\n \n\u201cNever fear, my boy!\u2014I am securely lashed. I\u2019ll spend the\ntime getting my notes into shape. A good hunt to you! but be careful. Besides,\nfrom my post here, I can observe the face of the country, and, at the least\nsuspicious thing I notice, I\u2019ll fire a signal-shot, and with that you\nmust rally home.\u201d\n \n\u201cAgreed!\u201d said Kennedy; and off they went.\n",
        "\n\nThe Forest of Gum-Trees.\u2014The Blue Antelope.\u2014The\nRallying-Signal.\u2014An Unexpected Attack.\u2014The Kanyem\u00e9.\u2014A Night\nin the Open Air.\u2014The Mabunguru.\u2014Jihoue-la-Mkoa.\u2014A Supply of\nWater.\u2014Arrival at Kazeh.\n \nThe country, dry and parched as it was, consisting of a clayey soil that\ncracked open with the heat, seemed, indeed, a desert: here and there were a few\ntraces of caravans; the bones of men and animals, that had been half-gnawed\naway, mouldering together in the same dust.\n \nAfter half an hour\u2019s walking, Dick and Joe plunged into a forest of\ngum-trees, their eyes alert on all sides, and their fingers on the trigger.\nThere was no foreseeing what they might encounter. Without being a rifleman,\nJoe could handle fire-arms with no trifling dexterity.\n \n\u201cA walk does one good, Mr. Kennedy, but this isn\u2019t the easiest\nground in the world,\u201d he said, kicking aside some fragments of quartz\nwith which the soil was bestrewn.\n \nKennedy motioned to his companion to be silent and to halt. The present case\ncompelled them to dispense with hunting-dogs, and, no matter what Joe\u2019s\nagility might be, he could not be expected to have the scent of a setter or a\ngreyhound.\n \nA herd of a dozen antelopes were quenching their thirst in the bed of a torrent\nwhere some pools of water had lodged. The graceful creatures, snuffing danger\nin the breeze, seemed to be disturbed and uneasy. Their beautiful heads could\nbe seen between every draught, raised in the air with quick and sudden motion\nas they sniffed the wind in the direction of our two hunters, with their\nflexible nostrils.\n \nKennedy stole around behind some clumps of shrubbery, while Joe remained\nmotionless where he was. The former, at length, got within gunshot and fired.\n \nThe herd disappeared in the twinkling of an eye; one male antelope only, that\nwas hit just behind the shoulder-joint, fell headlong to the ground, and\nKennedy leaped toward his booty.\n \nIt was a blauwbok, a superb animal of a pale-bluish color shading upon\nthe gray, but with the belly and the inside of the legs as white as the driven\nsnow.\n \n\u201cA splendid shot!\u201d exclaimed the hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s a very\nrare species of the antelope, and I hope to be able to prepare his skin in such\na way as to keep it.\u201d\n \n\u201cIndeed!\u201d said Joe, \u201cdo you think of doing that, Mr.\nKennedy?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, certainly I do! Just see what a fine hide it is!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut Dr. Ferguson will never allow us to take such an extra\nweight!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Joe. Still it is a pity to have to leave such a\nnoble animal.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe whole of it? Oh, we won\u2019t do that, sir; we\u2019ll take all\nthe good eatable parts of it, and, if you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll cut him\nup just as well as the chairman of the honorable corporation of butchers of the\ncity of London could do.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs you please, my boy! But you know that in my hunter\u2019s way I can\njust as easily skin and cut up a piece of game as kill it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure of that, Mr. Kennedy. Well, then, you can build a\nfireplace with a few stones; there\u2019s plenty of dry dead-wood, and I can\nmake the hot coals tell in a few minutes.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! that won\u2019t take long,\u201d said Kennedy, going to work on\nthe fireplace, where he had a brisk flame crackling and sparkling in a minute\nor two.\n \nJoe had cut some of the nicest steaks and the best parts of the tenderloin from\nthe carcass of the antelope, and these were quickly transformed to the most\nsavory of broils.\n \n\u201cThere, those will tickle the doctor!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cDo you know what I was thinking about?\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cWhy, about the steaks you\u2019re broiling, to be sure!\u201d replied\nDick.\n \n\u201cNot the least in the world. I was thinking what a figure we\u2019d cut\nif we couldn\u2019t find the balloon again.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy George, what an idea! Why, do you think the doctor would desert\nus?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; but suppose his anchor were to slip!\u201d\n \n\u201cImpossible! and, besides, the doctor would find no difficulty in coming\ndown again with his balloon; he handles it at his ease.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut suppose the wind were to sweep it off, so that he couldn\u2019t\ncome back toward us?\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, come, Joe! a truce to your suppositions; they\u2019re any thing\nbut pleasant.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! sir, every thing that happens in this world is natural, of course;\nbut, then, any thing may happen, and we ought to look out beforehand.\u201d\n \nAt this moment the report of a gun rang out upon the air.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d exclaimed Joe.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s my rifle, I know the ring of her!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cA signal!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; danger for us!\u201d\n \n\u201cFor him, too, perhaps.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet\u2019s be off!\u201d\n \nAnd the hunters, having gathered up the product of their expedition, rapidly\nmade their way back along the path that they had marked by breaking boughs and\nbushes when they came. The density of the underbrush prevented their seeing the\nballoon, although they could not be far from it.\n \nA second shot was heard.\n \n\u201cWe must hurry!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cThere! a third report!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, it sounds to me as if he was defending himself against\nsomething.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us make haste!\u201d\n \nThey now began to run at the top of their speed. When they reached the\noutskirts of the forest, they, at first glance, saw the balloon in its place\nand the doctor in the car.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d shouted Kennedy.\n \n\u201cGood God!\u201d suddenly exclaimed Joe.\n \n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n \n\u201cDown there! look! a crowd of blacks surrounding the balloon!\u201d\n \nAnd, in fact, there, two miles from where they were, they saw some thirty wild\nnatives close together, yelling, gesticulating, and cutting all kinds of antics\nat the foot of the sycamore. Some, climbing into the tree itself, were making\ntheir way to the topmost branches. The danger seemed pressing.\n \n\u201cMy master is lost!\u201d cried Joe.\n \n\u201cCome! a little more coolness, Joe, and let us see how we stand. We hold\nthe lives of four of those villains in our hands. Forward, then!\u201d\n \nThey had made a mile with headlong speed, when another report was heard from\nthe car. The shot had, evidently, told upon a huge black demon, who had been\nhoisting himself up by the anchor-rope. A lifeless body fell from bough to\nbough, and hung about twenty feet from the ground, its arms and legs swaying to\nand fro in the air.\n \n\u201cHa!\u201d said Joe, halting, \u201cwhat does that fellow hold\nby?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo matter what!\u201d said Kennedy; \u201clet us run! let us\nrun!\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! Mr. Kennedy,\u201d said Joe, again, in a roar of laughter,\n\u201cby his tail! by his tail! it\u2019s an ape! They\u2019re all\napes!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, they\u2019re worse than men!\u201d said Kennedy, as he dashed\ninto the midst of the howling crowd.\n \nIt was, indeed, a troop of very formidable baboons of the dog-faced species.\nThese creatures are brutal, ferocious, and horrible to look upon, with their\ndog-like muzzles and savage expression. However, a few shots scattered them,\nand the chattering horde scampered off, leaving several of their number on the\nground.\n \nIn a moment Kennedy was on the ladder, and Joe, clambering up the branches,\ndetached the anchor; the car then dipped to where he was, and he got into it\nwithout difficulty. A few minutes later, the Victoria slowly ascended\nand soared away to the eastward, wafted by a moderate wind.\n \n\u201cThat was an attack for you!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cWe thought you were surrounded by natives.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, fortunately, they were only apes,\u201d said the doctor.\n \n\u201cAt a distance there\u2019s no great difference,\u201d remarked\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cNor close at hand, either,\u201d added Joe.\n \n\u201cWell, however that may be,\u201d resumed Ferguson, \u201cthis attack\nof apes might have had the most serious consequences. Had the anchor yielded to\ntheir repeated efforts, who knows whither the wind would have carried\nme?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat did I tell you, Mr. Kennedy?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou were right, Joe; but, even right as you may have been, you were, at\nthat moment, preparing some antelope-steaks, the very sight of which gave me a\nmonstrous appetite.\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe you!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cthe flesh of the antelope\nis exquisite.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may judge of that yourself, now, sir, for supper\u2019s\nready.\u201d\n \n\u201cUpon my word as a sportsman, those venison-steaks have a gamy flavor\nthat\u2019s not to be sneezed at, I tell you.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d said Joe, with his mouth full, \u201cI could live on\nantelope all the days of my life; and all the better with a glass of grog to\nwash it down.\u201d\n \nSo saying, the good fellow went to work to prepare a jorum of that fragrant\nbeverage, and all hands tasted it with satisfaction.\n \n\u201cEvery thing has gone well thus far,\u201d said he.\n \n\u201cVery well indeed!\u201d assented Kennedy.\n \n\u201cCome, now, Mr. Kennedy, are you sorry that you came with us?\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to see anybody prevent my coming!\u201d\n \nIt was now four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. The Victoria had struck\na more rapid current. The face of the country was gradually rising, and, ere\nlong, the barometer indicated a height of fifteen hundred feet above the level\nof the sea. The doctor was, therefore, obliged to keep his balloon up by a\nquite considerable dilation of gas, and the cylinder was hard at work all the\ntime.\n \nToward seven o\u2019clock, the balloon was sailing over the basin of Kanyem\u00e9.\nThe doctor immediately recognized that immense clearing, ten miles in extent,\nwith its villages buried in the midst of baobab and calabash trees. It is the\nresidence of one of the sultans of the Ugogo country, where civilization is,\nperhaps, the least backward. The natives there are less addicted to selling\nmembers of their own families, but still, men and animals all live together in\nround huts, without frames, that look like haystacks.\n \nBeyond Kanyem\u00e9 the soil becomes arid and stony, but in an hour\u2019s journey,\nin a fertile dip of the soil, vegetation had resumed all its vigor at some\ndistance from Mdaburu. The wind fell with the close of the day, and the\natmosphere seemed to sleep. The doctor vainly sought for a current of air at\ndifferent heights, and, at last, seeing this calm of all nature, he resolved to\npass the night afloat, and, for greater safety, rose to the height of one\nthousand feet, where the balloon remained motionless. The night was\nmagnificent, the heavens glittering with stars, and profoundly silent in the\nupper air.\n \nDick and Joe stretched themselves on their peaceful couch, and were soon sound\nasleep, the doctor keeping the first watch. At twelve o\u2019clock the latter\nwas relieved by Kennedy.\n \n\u201cShould the slightest accident happen, waken me,\u201d said Ferguson,\n\u201cand, above all things, don\u2019t lose sight of the barometer. To us it\nis the compass!\u201d\n \nThe night was cold. There were twenty-seven degrees of difference between its\ntemperature and that of the daytime. With nightfall had begun the nocturnal\nconcert of animals driven from their hiding-places by hunger and thirst. The\nfrogs struck in their guttural soprano, redoubled by the yelping of the\njackals, while the imposing bass of the African lion sustained the accords of\nthis living orchestra.\n \nUpon resuming his post, in the morning, the doctor consulted his compass, and\nfound that the wind had changed during the night. The balloon had been bearing\nabout thirty miles to the northwest during the last two hours. It was then\npassing over Mabunguru, a stony country, strewn with blocks of syenite of a\nfine polish, and knobbed with huge bowlders and angular ridges of rock; conic\nmasses, like the rocks of Karnak, studded the soil like so many Druidic\ndolmens; the bones of buffaloes and elephants whitened it here and there; but\nfew trees could be seen, excepting in the east, where there were dense woods,\namong which a few villages lay half concealed.\n \nToward seven o\u2019clock they saw a huge round rock nearly two miles in\nextent, like an immense tortoise.\n \n\u201cWe are on the right track,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Jihoue-la-Mkoa, where we must halt for a few minutes. I am\ngoing to renew the supply of water necessary for my cylinder, and so let us try\nto anchor somewhere.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere are very few trees,\u201d replied the hunter.\n \n\u201cNever mind, let us try. Joe, throw out the anchors!\u201d\n \nThe balloon, gradually losing its ascensional force, approached the ground; the\nanchors ran along until, at last, one of them caught in the fissure of a rock,\nand the balloon remained motionless.\n \nIt must not be supposed that the doctor could entirely extinguish his cylinder,\nduring these halts. The equilibrium of the balloon had been calculated at the\nlevel of the sea; and, as the country was continually ascending, and had\nreached an elevation of from six to seven hundred feet, the balloon would have\nhad a tendency to go lower than the surface of the soil itself. It was,\ntherefore, necessary to sustain it by a certain dilation of the gas. But, in\ncase the doctor, in the absence of all wind, had let the car rest upon the\nground, the balloon, thus relieved of a considerable weight, would have kept up\nof itself, without the aid of the cylinder.\n \nThe maps indicated extensive ponds on the western slope of the Jihoue-la-Mkoa.\nJoe went thither alone with a cask that would hold about ten gallons. He found\nthe place pointed out to him, without difficulty, near to a deserted village;\ngot his stock of water, and returned in less than three-quarters of an hour. He\nhad seen nothing particular excepting some immense elephant-pits. In fact, he\ncame very near falling into one of them, at the bottom of which lay a\nhalf-eaten carcass.\n \nHe brought back with him a sort of clover which the apes eat with avidity. The\ndoctor recognized the fruit of the \u201cmbenbu\u201d\u2014tree which grows\nin profusion, on the western part of Jihoue-la-Mkoa. Ferguson waited for Joe\nwith a certain feeling of impatience, for even a short halt in this\ninhospitable region always inspires a degree of fear.\n \nThe water was got aboard without trouble, as the car was nearly resting on the\nground. Joe then found it easy to loosen the anchor and leaped lightly to his\nplace beside the doctor. The latter then replenished the flame in the cylinder,\nand the balloon majestically soared into the air.\n \nIt was then about one hundred miles from Kazeh, an important establishment in\nthe interior of Africa, where, thanks to a south-southeasterly current, the\ntravellers might hope to arrive on that same day. They were moving at the rate\nof fourteen miles per hour, and the guidance of the balloon was becoming\ndifficult, as they dared not rise very high without extreme dilation of the\ngas, the country itself being at an average height of three thousand feet.\nHence, the doctor preferred not to force the dilation, and so adroitly followed\nthe sinuosities of a pretty sharply-inclined plane, and swept very close to the\nvillages of Thembo and Tura-Wels. The latter forms part of the Unyamwezy, a\nmagnificent country, where the trees attain enormous dimensions; among them the\ncactus, which grows to gigantic size.\n \nAbout two o\u2019clock, in magnificent weather, but under a fiery sun that\ndevoured the least breath of air, the balloon was floating over the town of\nKazeh, situated about three hundred and fifty miles from the coast.\n \n\u201cWe left Zanzibar at nine o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d said the\ndoctor, consulting his notes, \u201cand, after two days\u2019 passage, we\nhave, including our deviations, travelled nearly five hundred geographical\nmiles. Captains Burton and Speke took four months and a half to make the same\ndistance!\u201d\n",

Kazeh is but a collection of six extensive\nexcavations. There are enclosed a few houses and slave-huts, with little\ncourt-yards and small gardens, carefully cultivated with onions, potatoes,\ncucumbers, pumpkins, and mushrooms, of perfect flavor, growing most\nluxuriantly.\n \nThe Unyamwezy is the country of the Moon\u2014above all the rest, the fertile\nand magnificent garden-spot of Africa. In its centre is the district of\nUnyanembe\u2014a delicious region, where some families of Omani, who are of\nvery pure Arabic origin, live in luxurious idleness.\n \nThey have, for a long period, held the commerce between the interior of Africa\nand Arabia: they trade in gums, ivory, fine muslin, and slaves. Their caravans\ntraverse these equatorial regions on all sides; and they even make their way to\nthe coast in search of those articles of luxury and enjoyment which the wealthy\nmerchants covet; while the latter, surrounded by their wives and their\nattendants, lead in this charming country the least disturbed and most\nhorizontal of lives\u2014always stretched at full length, laughing, smoking,\nor sleeping.\n \nAround these excavations are numerous native dwellings; wide, open spaces for\nthe markets; fields of cannabis and datura; superb trees and\ndepths of freshest shade\u2014such is Kazeh!\n \nThere, too, is held the general rendezvous of the caravans\u2014those of the\nsouth, with their slaves and their freightage of ivory; and those of the west,\nwhich export cotton, glassware, and trinkets, to the tribes of the great lakes.\n \nSo in the market-place there reigns perpetual excitement, a nameless hubbub,\nmade up of the cries of mixed-breed porters and carriers, the beating of drums,\nand the twanging of horns, the neighing of mules, the braying of donkeys, the\nsinging of women, the squalling of children, and the banging of the huge\nrattan, wielded by the jemadar or leader of the caravans, who beats time to\nthis pastoral symphony.\n \nThere, spread forth, without regard to order\u2014indeed, we may say, in\ncharming disorder\u2014are the showy stuffs, the glass beads, the ivory tusks,\nthe rhinoceros\u2019-teeth, the shark\u2019s-teeth, the honey, the tobacco,\nand the cotton of these regions, to be purchased at the strangest of bargains\nby customers in whose eyes each article has a price only in proportion to the\ndesire it excites to possess it.\n \nAll at once this agitation, movement and noise stopped as though by magic. The\nballoon had just come in sight, far aloft in the sky, where it hovered\nmajestically for a few moments, and then descended slowly, without deviating\nfrom its perpendicular. Men, women, children, merchants and slaves, Arabs and\nnegroes, as suddenly disappeared within the \u201ctembes\u201d and the huts.\n \n\u201cMy dear doctor,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cif we continue to produce\nsuch a sensation as this, we shall find some difficulty in establishing\ncommercial relations with the people hereabouts.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s one kind of trade that we might carry on, though, easily\nenough,\u201d said Joe; \u201cand that would be to go down there quietly, and\nwalk off with the best of the goods, without troubling our heads about the\nmerchants; we\u2019d get rich that way!\u201d\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthese natives are a little scared at\nfirst; but they won\u2019t be long in coming back, either through suspicion or\nthrough curiosity.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you really think so, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see pretty soon. But it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to\ngo too near to them, for the balloon is not iron-clad, and is, therefore, not\nproof against either an arrow or a bullet.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen you expect to hold a parley with these blacks?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf we can do so safely, why should we not? There must be some Arab\nmerchants here at Kazeh, who are better informed than the rest, and not so\nbarbarous. I remember that Burton and Speke had nothing but praises to utter\nconcerning the hospitality of these people; so we might, at least, make the\nventure.\u201d\n \nThe balloon having, meanwhile, gradually approached the ground, one of the\nanchors lodged in the top of a tree near the market-place.\n \nBy this time the whole population had emerged from their hiding-places\nstealthily, thrusting their heads out first. Several \u201cwaganga,\u201d\nrecognizable by their badges of conical shellwork, came boldly forward. They\nwere the sorcerers of the place. They bore in their girdles small gourds,\ncoated with tallow, and several other articles of witchcraft, all of them,\nby-the-way, most professionally filthy.\n \nLittle by little the crowd gathered beside them, the women and children grouped\naround them, the drums renewed their deafening uproar, hands were violently\nclapped together, and then raised toward the sky.\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s their style of praying,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cand,\nif I\u2019m not mistaken, we\u2019re going to be called upon to play a great\npart.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, sir, play it!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou, too, my good Joe\u2014perhaps you\u2019re to be a god!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, master, that won\u2019t trouble me much. I like a little\nflattery!\u201d\n \nAt this moment, one of the sorcerers, a \u201cmyanga,\u201d made a sign, and\nall the clamor died away into the profoundest silence. He then addressed a few\nwords to the strangers, but in an unknown tongue.\n \nDr. Ferguson, not having understood them, shouted some sentences in Arabic, at\na venture, and was immediately answered in that language.\n \nThe speaker below then delivered himself of a very copious harangue, which was\nalso very flowery and very gravely listened to by his audience. From it the\ndoctor was not slow in learning that the balloon was mistaken for nothing less\nthan the moon in person, and that the amiable goddess in question had\ncondescended to approach the town with her three sons\u2014an honor that would\nnever be forgotten in this land so greatly loved by the god of day.\n \nThe doctor responded, with much dignity, that the moon made her provincial tour\nevery thousand years, feeling the necessity of showing herself nearer at hand\nto her worshippers. He, therefore, begged them not to be disturbed by her\npresence, but to take advantage of it to make known all their wants and\nlongings.\n \nThe sorcerer, in his turn, replied that the sultan, the \u201cmwani,\u201d\nwho had been sick for many years, implored the aid of heaven, and he invited\nthe son of the moon to visit him.\n \nThe doctor acquainted his companions with the invitation.\n \n\u201cAnd you are going to call upon this negro king?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly so; these people appear well disposed; the air is calm;\nthere is not a breath of wind, and we have nothing to fear for the\nballoon?\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, what will you do?\u201d\n \n\u201cBe quiet on that score, my dear Dick. With a little medicine, I shall\nwork my way through the affair!\u201d\n \nThen, addressing the crowd, he said:\n \n\u201cThe moon, taking compassion on the sovereign who is so dear to the\nchildren of Unyamwezy, has charged us to restore him to health. Let him prepare\nto receive us!\u201d\n \nThe clamor, the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold, and\nthe whole immense ants\u2019 nest of black heads was again in motion.\n \n\u201cNow, my friends,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson, \u201cwe must look out for\nevery thing beforehand; we may be forced to leave this at any moment,\nunexpectedly, and be off with extra speed. Dick had better remain, therefore,\nin the car, and keep the cylinder warm so as to secure a sufficient ascensional\nforce for the balloon. The anchor is solidly fastened, and there is nothing to\nfear in that respect. I shall descend, and Joe will go with me, only that he\nmust remain at the foot of the ladder.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! are you going alone into that blackamoor\u2019s den?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow! doctor, am I not to go with you?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! I shall go alone; these good folks imagine that the goddess of the\nmoon has come to see them, and their superstition protects me; so have no fear,\nand each one remain at the post that I have assigned to him.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, since you wish it,\u201d sighed Kennedy.\n \n\u201cLook closely to the dilation of the gas.\u201d\n \n\u201cAgreed!\u201d\n \nBy this time the shouts of the natives had swelled to double volume as they\nvehemently implored the aid of the heavenly powers.\n \n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said Joe, \u201cthey\u2019re rather rough in\ntheir orders to their good moon and her divine sons.\u201d\n \nThe doctor, equipped with his travelling medicine-chest, descended to the\nground, preceded by Joe, who kept a straight countenance and looked as grave\nand knowing as the circumstances of the case required. He then seated himself\nat the foot of the ladder in the Arab fashion, with his legs crossed under him,\nand a portion of the crowd collected around him in a circle, at respectful\ndistances.\n \nIn the meanwhile the doctor, escorted to the sound of savage instruments, and\nwith wild religious dances, slowly proceeded toward the royal\n\u201ctembe,\u201d situated a considerable distance outside of the town. It\nwas about three o\u2019clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly. In fact,\nwhat less could it do upon so grand an occasion!\n \nThe doctor stepped along with great dignity, the waganga surrounding him and\nkeeping off the crowd. He was soon joined by the natural son of the sultan, a\nhandsomely-built young fellow, who, according to the custom of the country, was\nthe sole heir of the paternal goods, to the exclusion of the old man\u2019s\nlegitimate children. He prostrated himself before the son of the moon, but the\nlatter graciously raised him to his feet.\n \nThree-quarters of an hour later, through shady paths, surrounded by all the\nluxuriance of tropical vegetation, this enthusiastic procession arrived at the\nsultan\u2019s palace, a sort of square edifice called itit\u00e9nya, and\nsituated on the slope of a hill.\n \nA kind of veranda, formed by the thatched roof, adorned the outside, supported\nupon wooden pillars, which had some pretensions to being carved. Long lines of\ndark-red clay decorated the walls in characters that strove to reproduce the\nforms of men and serpents, the latter better imitated, of course, than the\nformer. The roofing of this abode did not rest directly upon the walls, and the\nair could, therefore, circulate freely, but windows there were none, and the\ndoor hardly deserved the name.\n \nDr. Ferguson was received with all the honors by the guards and favorites of\nthe sultan; these were men of a fine race, the Wanyamwezi so-called, a pure\ntype of the central African populations, strong, robust, well-made, and in\nsplendid condition. Their hair, divided into a great number of small tresses,\nfell over their shoulders, and by means of black-and-blue incisions they had\ntattooed their cheeks from the temples to the mouth. Their ears, frightfully\ndistended, held dangling to them disks of wood and plates of gum copal. They\nwere clad in brilliantly-painted cloths, and the soldiers were armed with the\nsaw-toothed war-club, the bow and arrows barbed and poisoned with the juice of\nthe euphorbium, the cutlass, the \u201csima,\u201d a long sabre (also with\nsaw-like teeth), and some small battle-axes.\n \nThe doctor advanced into the palace, and there, notwithstanding the\nsultan\u2019s illness, the din, which was terrific before, redoubled the\ninstant that he arrived. He noticed, at the lintels of the door, some\nrabbits\u2019 tails and zebras\u2019 manes, suspended as talismans. He was\nreceived by the whole troop of his majesty\u2019s wives, to the harmonious\naccords of the \u201cupatu,\u201d a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a\ncopper kettle, and to the uproar of the \u201ckilindo,\u201d a drum five feet\nhigh, hollowed out from the trunk of a tree, and hammered by the ponderous,\nhorny fists of two jet-black virtuosi.\n \nMost of the women were rather good-looking, and they laughed and chattered\nmerrily as they smoked their tobacco and \u201cthang\u201d in huge black\npipes. They seemed to be well made, too, under the long robes that they wore\ngracefully flung about their persons, and carried a sort of \u201ckilt\u201d\nwoven from the fibres of calabash fastened around their girdles.\n \nSix of them were not the least merry of the party, although put aside from the\nrest, and reserved for a cruel fate. On the death of the sultan, they were to\nbe buried alive with him, so as to occupy and divert his mind during the period\nof eternal solitude.\n \nDr. Ferguson, taking in the whole scene at a rapid glance, approached the\nwooden couch on which the sultan lay reclining. There he saw a man of about\nforty, completely brutalized by orgies of every description, and in a condition\nthat left little or nothing to be done. The sickness that had afflicted him for\nso many years was simply perpetual drunkenness. The royal sot had nearly lost\nall consciousness, and all the ammonia in the world would not have set him on\nhis feet again.\n \nHis favorites and the women kept on bended knees during this solemn visit. By\nmeans of a few drops of powerful cordial, the doctor for a moment reanimated\nthe imbruted carcass that lay before him. The sultan stirred, and, for a dead\nbody that had given no sign whatever of life for several hours previously, this\nsymptom was received with a tremendous repetition of shouts and cries in the\ndoctor\u2019s honor.\n \nThe latter, who had seen enough of it by this time, by a rapid motion put aside\nhis too demonstrative admirers and went out of the palace, directing his steps\nimmediately toward the balloon, for it was now six o\u2019clock in the\nevening.\n \nJoe, during his absence, had been quietly waiting at the foot of the ladder,\nwhere the crowd paid him their most humble respects. Like a genuine son of the\nmoon, he let them keep on. For a divinity, he had the air of a very clever sort\nof fellow, by no means proud, nay, even pleasingly familiar with the young\nnegresses, who seemed never to tire of looking at him. Besides, he went so far\nas to chat agreeably with them.\n \n\u201cWorship me, ladies! worship me!\u201d he said to them. \u201cI\u2019m\na clever sort of devil, if I am the son of a goddess.\u201d\n \nThey brought him propitiatory gifts, such as are usually deposited in the\nfetich huts or mzimu. These gifts consisted of stalks of barley\nand of \u201cpombe.\u201d Joe considered himself in duty bound to taste the\nlatter species of strong beer, but his palate, although accustomed to gin and\nwhiskey, could not withstand the strength of the new beverage, and he had to\nmake a horrible grimace, which his dusky friends took to be a benevolent smile.\n \nThereupon, the young damsels, conjoining their voices in a drawling chant,\nbegan to dance around him with the utmost gravity.\n \n\u201cAh! you\u2019re dancing, are you?\u201d said he. \u201cWell, I\nwon\u2019t be behind you in politeness, and so I\u2019ll give you one of my\ncountry reels.\u201d\n \nSo at it he went, in one of the wildest jigs that ever was seen, twisting,\nturning, and jerking himself in all directions; dancing with his hands, dancing\nwith his body, dancing with his knees, dancing with his feet; describing the\nmost fearful contortions and extravagant evolutions; throwing himself into\nincredible attitudes; grimacing beyond all belief, and, in fine giving his\nsavage admirers a strange idea of the style of ballet adopted by the deities in\nthe moon.\n \nThen, the whole collection of blacks, naturally as imitative as monkeys, at\nonce reproduced all his airs and graces, his leaps and shakes and contortions;\nthey did not lose a single gesticulation; they did not forget an attitude; and\nthe result was, such a pandemonium of movement, noise, and excitement, as it\nwould be out of the question even feebly to describe. But, in the very midst of\nthe fun, Joe saw the doctor approaching.\n \nThe latter was coming at full speed, surrounded by a yelling and disorderly\nthrong. The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited. They were close\nupon the doctor\u2019s heels, crowding and threatening him.\n \nSingular reaction! What had happened? Had the sultan unluckily perished in the\nhands of his celestial physician?\n \nKennedy, from his post of observation, saw the danger without knowing what had\ncaused it, and the balloon, powerfully urged by the dilation of the gas,\nstrained and tugged at the ropes that held it as though impatient to soar away.\n \nThe doctor had got as far as the foot of the ladder. A superstitious fear still\nheld the crowd aloof and hindered them from committing any violence on his\nperson. He rapidly scaled the ladder, and Joe followed him with his usual\nagility.\n \n\u201cNot a moment to lose!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cDon\u2019t attempt\nto let go the anchor! We\u2019ll cut the cord! Follow me!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Joe, clambering into the car.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d questioned Kennedy, rifle in hand.\n \n\u201cLook!\u201d replied the doctor, pointing to the horizon.\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d ejaculated the Scot.\n \n\u201cWell! the moon!\u201d\n \nAnd, in fact, there was the moon rising red and magnificent, a globe of fire in\na field of blue! It was she, indeed\u2014she and the balloon!\u2014both in\none sky!\n \nEither there were two moons, then, or these strangers were imposters, designing\nscamps, false deities!\n \nSuch were the very natural reflections of the crowd, and hence the reaction in\ntheir feelings.\n \nJoe could not, for the life of him, keep in a roar of laughter; and the\npopulation of Kazeh, comprehending that their prey was slipping through their\nclutches, set up prolonged howlings, aiming, the while, their bows and muskets\nat the balloon.\n \nBut one of the sorcerers made a sign, and all the weapons were lowered. He then\nbegan to climb into the tree, intending to seize the rope and bring the machine\nto the ground.\n \nJoe leaned out with a hatchet ready. \u201cShall I cut away?\u201d said he.\n \n\u201cNo; wait a moment,\u201d replied the doctor.\n \n\u201cBut this black?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe may, perhaps, save our anchor\u2014and I hold a great deal by that.\nThere\u2019ll always be time enough to cut loose.\u201d\n \nThe sorcerer, having climbed to the right place, worked so vigorously that he\nsucceeded in detaching the anchor, and the latter, violently jerked, at that\nmoment, by the start of the balloon, caught the rascal between the limbs, and\ncarried him off astride of it through the air.\n \nThe stupefaction of the crowd was indescribable as they saw one of their\nwaganga thus whirled away into space.\n \n\u201cHuzza!\u201d roared Joe, as the balloon\u2014thanks to its ascensional\nforce\u2014shot up higher into the sky, with increased rapidity.\n \n\u201cHe holds on well,\u201d said Kennedy; \u201ca little trip will do him\ngood.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we let this darky drop all at once?\u201d inquired Joe.\n \n\u201cOh no,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cwe\u2019ll let him down\neasily; and I warrant me that, after such an adventure, the power of the wizard\nwill be enormously enhanced in the sight of his comrades.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to make a god of him!\u201d said\nJoe, with a laugh.\n \nThe Victoria, by this time, had risen to the height of one thousand\nfeet, and the black hung to the rope with desperate energy. He had become\ncompletely silent, and his eyes were fixed, for his terror was blended with\namazement. A light west wind was sweeping the balloon right over the town, and\nfar beyond it.\n \nHalf an hour later, the doctor, seeing the country deserted, moderated the\nflame of his cylinder, and descended toward the ground. At twenty feet above\nthe turf, the affrighted sorcerer made up his mind in a twinkling: he let\nhimself drop, fell on his feet, and scampered off at a furious pace toward\nKazeh; while the balloon, suddenly relieved of his weight, again shot up on her\ncourse.\n",

She came near serving us an ugly trick. But say, master, did\nyou damage your credit as a physician?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d chimed in the sportsman. \u201cWhat kind of a\ndignitary was this Sultan of Kazeh?\u201d\n \n\u201cAn old half-dead sot,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cwhose loss will\nnot be very severely felt. But the moral of all this is that honors are\nfleeting, and we must not take too great a fancy to them.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo much the worse!\u201d rejoined Joe. \u201cI liked the\nthing\u2014to be worshipped!\u2014Play the god as you like! Why, what would\nany one ask more than that? By-the-way, the moon did come up, too, and all red,\nas if she was in a rage.\u201d\n \nWhile the three friends went on chatting of this and other things, and Joe\nexamined the luminary of night from an entirely novel point of view, the\nheavens became covered with heavy clouds to the northward, and the lowering\nmasses assumed a most sinister and threatening look. Quite a smart breeze,\nfound about three hundred feet from the earth, drove the balloon toward the\nnorth-northeast; and above it the blue vault was clear; but the atmosphere felt\nclose and dull.\n \nThe a\u00ebronauts found themselves, at about eight in the evening, in thirty-two\ndegrees forty minutes east longitude, and four degrees seventeen minutes\nlatitude. The atmospheric currents, under the influence of a tempest not far\noff, were driving them at the rate of from thirty to thirty-five miles an hour;\nthe undulating and fertile plains of Mfuto were passing swiftly beneath them.\nThe spectacle was one worthy of admiration\u2014and admire it they did.\n \n\u201cWe are now right in the country of the Moon,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson;\n\u201cfor it has retained the name that antiquity gave it, undoubtedly,\nbecause the moon has been worshipped there in all ages. It is, really, a superb\ncountry.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt would be hard to find more splendid vegetation.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf we found the like of it around London it would not be natural, but it\nwould be very pleasant,\u201d put in Joe. \u201cWhy is it that such savage\ncountries get all these fine things?\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd who knows,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthat this country may not,\none day, become the centre of civilization? The races of the future may repair\nhither, when Europe shall have become exhausted in the effort to feed her\ninhabitants.\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you think so, really?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly, my dear Dick. Just note the progress of events: consider\nthe migrations of races, and you will arrive at the same conclusion assuredly.\nAsia was the first nurse of the world, was she not? For about four thousand\nyears she travailed, she grew pregnant, she produced, and then, when stones\nbegan to cover the soil where the golden harvests sung by Homer had flourished,\nher children abandoned her exhausted and barren bosom. You next see them\nprecipitating themselves upon young and vigorous Europe, which has nourished\nthem for the last two thousand years. But already her fertility is beginning to\ndie out; her productive powers are diminishing every day. Those new diseases\nthat annually attack the products of the soil, those defective crops, those\ninsufficient resources, are all signs of a vitality that is rapidly wearing out\nand of an approaching exhaustion. Thus, we already see the millions rushing to\nthe luxuriant bosom of America, as a source of help, not inexhaustible indeed,\nbut not yet exhausted. In its turn, that new continent will grow old; its\nvirgin forests will fall before the axe of industry, and its soil will become\nweak through having too fully produced what had been demanded of it. Where two\nharvests bloomed every year, hardly one will be gathered from a soil completely\ndrained of its strength. Then, Africa will be there to offer to new races the\ntreasures that for centuries have been accumulating in her breast. Those\nclimates now so fatal to strangers will be purified by cultivation and by\ndrainage of the soil, and those scattered water supplies will be gathered into\none common bed to form an artery of navigation. Then this country over which we\nare now passing, more fertile, richer, and fuller of vitality than the rest,\nwill become some grand realm where more astonishing discoveries than steam and\nelectricity will be brought to light.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! sir,\u201d said Joe, \u201cI\u2019d like to see all that.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou got up too early in the morning, my boy!\u201d\n \n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cthat may prove to be a very dull\nperiod when industry will swallow up every thing for its own profit. By dint of\ninventing machinery, men will end in being eaten up by it! I have always\nfancied that the end of the earth will be when some enormous boiler, heated to\nthree thousand millions of atmospheric pressure, shall explode and blow up our\nGlobe!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I add that the Americans,\u201d said Joe, \u201cwill not have been\nthe last to work at the machine!\u201d\n \n\u201cIn fact,\u201d assented the doctor, \u201cthey are great\nboiler-makers! But, without allowing ourselves to be carried away by such\nspeculations, let us rest content with enjoying the beauties of this country of\nthe Moon, since we have been permitted to see it.\u201d\n \nThe sun, darting his last rays beneath the masses of heaped-up cloud, adorned\nwith a crest of gold the slightest inequalities of the ground below; gigantic\ntrees, arborescent bushes, mosses on the even surface\u2014all had their share\nof this luminous effulgence. The soil, slightly undulating, here and there rose\ninto little conical hills; there were no mountains visible on the horizon;\nimmense brambly palisades, impenetrable hedges of thorny jungle, separated the\nclearings dotted with numerous villages, and immense euphorbiae surrounded them\nwith natural fortifications, interlacing their trunks with the coral-shaped\nbranches of the shrubbery and undergrowth.\n \nEre long, the Malagazeri, the chief tributary of Lake Tanganayika, was seen\nwinding between heavy thickets of verdure, offering an asylum to many\nwater-courses that spring from the torrents formed in the season of freshets,\nor from ponds hollowed in the clayey soil. To observers looking from a height,\nit was a chain of waterfalls thrown across the whole western face of the\ncountry.\n \nAnimals with huge humps were feeding in the luxuriant prairies, and were half\nhidden, sometimes, in the tall grass; spreading forests in bloom redolent of\nspicy perfumes presented themselves to the gaze like immense bouquets; but, in\nthese bouquets, lions, leopards, hyenas, and tigers, were then crouching for\nshelter from the last hot rays of the setting sun. From time to time, an\nelephant made the tall tops of the undergrowth sway to and fro, and you could\nhear the crackling of huge branches as his ponderous ivory tusks broke them in\nhis way.\n \n\u201cWhat a sporting country!\u201d exclaimed Dick, unable longer to\nrestrain his enthusiasm; \u201cwhy, a single ball fired at random into those\nforests would bring down game worthy of it. Suppose we try it once!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, my dear Dick; the night is close at hand\u2014a threatening night\nwith a tempest in the background\u2014and the storms are awful in this\ncountry, where the heated soil is like one vast electric battery.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are right, sir,\u201d said Joe, \u201cthe heat has got to be\nenough to choke one, and the breeze has died away. One can feel that\nsomething\u2019s coming.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe atmosphere is saturated with electricity,\u201d replied the doctor;\n\u201cevery living creature is sensible that this state of the air portends a\nstruggle of the elements, and I confess that I never before was so full of the\nfluid myself.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then,\u201d suggested Dick, \u201cwould it not be advisable to\nalight?\u201d\n \n\u201cOn the contrary, Dick, I\u2019d rather go up, only that I am afraid of\nbeing carried out of my course by these counter-currents contending in the\natmosphere.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave you any idea, then, of abandoning the route that we have followed\nsince we left the coast?\u201d\n \n\u201cIf I can manage to do so,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cI will turn\nmore directly northward, by from seven to eight degrees; I shall then endeavor\nto ascend toward the presumed latitudes of the sources of the Nile; perhaps we\nmay discover some traces of Captain Speke\u2019s expedition or of M. de\nHeuglin\u2019s caravan. Unless I am mistaken, we are at thirty-two degrees\nforty minutes east longitude, and I should like to ascend directly north of the\nequator.\u201d\n \n\u201cLook there!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly, \u201csee those\nhippopotami sliding out of the pools\u2014those masses of blood-colored\nflesh\u2014and those crocodiles snuffing the air aloud!\u201d\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re choking!\u201d ejaculated Joe. \u201cAh! what a fine way\nto travel this is; and how one can snap his fingers at all that\nvermin!\u2014Doctor! Mr. Kennedy! see those packs of wild animals hurrying\nalong close together. There are fully two hundred. Those are wolves.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! Joe, not wolves, but wild dogs; a famous breed that does not\nhesitate to attack the lion himself. They are the worst customers a traveller\ncould meet, for they would instantly tear him to pieces.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t Joe that\u2019ll undertake to muzzle them!\u201d\nresponded that amiable youth. \u201cAfter all, though, if that\u2019s the\nnature of the beast, we mustn\u2019t be too hard on them for it!\u201d\n \nSilence gradually settled down under the influence of the impending storm: the\nthickened air actually seemed no longer adapted to the transmission of sound;\nthe atmosphere appeared muffled, and, like a room hung with tapestry,\nlost all its sonorous reverberation. The \u201crover bird\u201d so-called,\nthe coroneted crane, the red and blue jays, the mocking-bird, the flycatcher,\ndisappeared among the foliage of the immense trees, and all nature revealed\nsymptoms of some approaching catastrophe.\n \nAt nine o\u2019clock the Victoria hung motionless over Msene, an\nextensive group of villages scarcely distinguishable in the gloom. Once in a\nwhile, the reflection of a wandering ray of light in the dull water disclosed a\nsuccession of ditches regularly arranged, and, by one last gleam, the eye could\nmake out the calm and sombre forms of palm-trees, sycamores, and gigantic\neuphorbiae.\n \n\u201cI am stifling!\u201d said the Scot, inhaling, with all the power of his\nlungs, as much as possible of the rarefied air. \u201cWe are not moving an\ninch! Let us descend!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut the tempest!\u201d said the doctor, with much uneasiness.\n \n\u201cIf you are afraid of being carried away by the wind, it seems to me that\nthere is no other course to pursue.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps the storm won\u2019t burst to-night,\u201d said Joe;\n\u201cthe clouds are very high.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is just the thing that makes me hesitate about going beyond them;\nwe should have to rise still higher, lose sight of the earth, and not know all\nnight whether we were moving forward or not, or in what direction we were\ngoing.\u201d\n \n\u201cMake up your mind, dear doctor, for time presses!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that the wind has fallen,\u201d said Joe, again;\n\u201cit would have carried us clear of the storm.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is, indeed, a pity, my friends,\u201d rejoined the doctor.\n\u201cThe clouds are dangerous for us; they contain opposing currents which\nmight catch us in their eddies, and lightnings that might set on fire. Again,\nthose perils avoided, the force of the tempest might hurl us to the ground,\nwere we to cast our anchor in the tree-tops.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen what shall we do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we must try to get the balloon into a medium zone of the\natmosphere, and there keep her suspended between the perils of the heavens and\nthose of the earth. We have enough water for the cylinder, and our two hundred\npounds of ballast are untouched. In case of emergency I can use them.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe will keep watch with you,\u201d said the hunter.\n \n\u201cNo, my friends, put the provisions under shelter, and lie down; I will\nrouse you, if it becomes necessary.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, master, wouldn\u2019t you do well to take some rest yourself, as\nthere\u2019s no danger close on us just now?\u201d insisted poor Joe.\n \n\u201cNo, thank you, my good fellow, I prefer to keep awake. We are not\nmoving, and should circumstances not change, we\u2019ll find ourselves\nto-morrow in exactly the same place.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-night, then, sir!\u201d\n \n\u201cGood-night, if you can only find it so!\u201d\n \nKennedy and Joe stretched themselves out under their blankets, and the doctor\nremained alone in the immensity of space.\n \nHowever, the huge dome of clouds visibly descended, and the darkness became\nprofound. The black vault closed in upon the earth as if to crush it in its\nembrace.\n \nAll at once a violent, rapid, incisive flash of lightning pierced the gloom,\nand the rent it made had not closed ere a frightful clap of thunder shook the\ncelestial depths.\n \n\u201cUp! up! turn out!\u201d shouted Ferguson.\n \nThe two sleepers, aroused by the terrible concussion, were at the\ndoctor\u2019s orders in a moment.\n \n\u201cShall we descend?\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNo! the balloon could not stand it. Let us go up before those clouds\ndissolve in water, and the wind is let loose!\u201d and, so saying, the doctor\nactively stirred up the flame of the cylinder, and turned it on the spirals of\nthe serpentine siphon.\n \nThe tempests of the tropics develop with a rapidity equalled only by their\nviolence. A second flash of lightning rent the darkness, and was followed by a\nscore of others in quick succession. The sky was crossed and dotted, like the\nzebra\u2019s hide, with electric sparks, which danced and flickered beneath\nthe great drops of rain.\n \n\u201cWe have delayed too long,\u201d exclaimed the doctor; \u201cwe must\nnow pass through a zone of fire, with our balloon filled as it is with\ninflammable gas!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut let us descend, then! let us descend!\u201d urged Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThe risk of being struck would be just about even, and we should soon be\ntorn to pieces by the branches of the trees!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are going up, doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cQuicker, quicker still!\u201d\n \nIn this part of Africa, during the equatorial storms, it is not rare to count\nfrom thirty to thirty-five flashes of lightning per minute. The sky is\nliterally on fire, and the crashes of thunder are continuous.\n \nThe wind burst forth with frightful violence in this burning atmosphere; it\ntwisted the blazing clouds; one might have compared it to the breath of some\ngigantic bellows, fanning all this conflagration.\n \nDr. Ferguson kept his cylinder at full heat, and the balloon dilated and went\nup, while Kennedy, on his knees, held together the curtains of the awning. The\nballoon whirled round wildly enough to make their heads turn, and the a\u00ebronauts\ngot some very alarming jolts, indeed, as their machine swung and swayed in all\ndirections. Huge cavities would form in the silk of the balloon as the wind\nfiercely bent it in, and the stuff fairly cracked like a pistol as it flew back\nfrom the pressure. A sort of hail, preceded by a rumbling noise, hissed through\nthe air and rattled on the covering of the Victoria. The latter,\nhowever, continued to ascend, while the lightning described tangents to the\nconvexity of her circumference; but she bore on, right through the midst of the\nfire.\n \n\u201cGod protect us!\u201d said Dr. Ferguson, solemnly, \u201cwe are in His\nhands; He alone can save us\u2014but let us be ready for every event, even for\nfire\u2014our fall could not be very rapid.\u201d\n \nThe doctor\u2019s voice could scarcely be heard by his companions; but they\ncould see his countenance calm as ever even amid the flashing of the\nlightnings; he was watching the phenomena of phosphorescence produced by the\nfires of St. Elmo, that were now skipping to and fro along the network of the\nballoon.\n \nThe latter whirled and swung, but steadily ascended, and, ere the hour was\nover, it had passed the stormy belt. The electric display was going on below it\nlike a vast crown of artificial fireworks suspended from the car.\n \nThen they enjoyed one of the grandest spectacles that Nature can offer to the\ngaze of man. Below them, the tempest; above them, the starry firmament,\ntranquil, mute, impassible, with the moon projecting her peaceful rays over\nthese angry clouds.\n \nDr. Ferguson consulted the barometer; it announced twelve thousand feet of\nelevation. It was then eleven o\u2019clock at night.\n \n\u201cThank Heaven, all danger is past; all we have to do now, is, to keep\nourselves at this height,\u201d said the doctor.\n \n\u201cIt was frightful!\u201d remarked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cOh!\u201d said Joe, \u201cit gives a little variety to the trip, and\nI\u2019m not sorry to have seen a storm from a trifling distance up in the\nair. It\u2019s a fine sight!\u201d\n",
        "\n\nThe Mountains of the Moon.\u2014An Ocean of Verdure.\u2014They cast\nAnchor.\u2014The Towing Elephant.\u2014A Running Fire.\u2014Death of the\nMonster.\u2014The Field-Oven.\u2014A Meal on the Grass.\u2014A Night on the\nGround.\n \nAbout four in the morning, Monday, the sun reappeared in the horizon; the\nclouds had dispersed, and a cheery breeze refreshed the morning dawn.\n \nThe earth, all redolent with fragrant exhalations, reappeared to the gaze of\nour travellers. The balloon, whirled about by opposing currents, had hardly\nbudged from its place, and the doctor, letting the gas contract, descended so\nas to get a more northerly direction. For a long while his quest was fruitless;\nthe wind carried him toward the west until he came in sight of the famous\nMountains of the Moon, which grouped themselves in a semicircle around the\nextremity of Lake Tanganayika; their ridges, but slightly indented, stood out\nagainst the bluish horizon, so that they might have been mistaken for a natural\nfortification, not to be passed by the explorers of the centre of Africa. Among\nthem were a few isolated cones, revealing the mark of the eternal snows.\n \n\u201cHere we are at last,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cin an unexplored\ncountry! Captain Burton pushed very far to the westward, but he could not reach\nthose celebrated mountains; he even denied their existence, strongly as it was\naffirmed by Speke, his companion. He pretended that they were born in the\nlatter\u2019s fancy; but for us, my friends, there is no further doubt\npossible.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we cross them?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNot, if it please God. I am looking for a wind that will take me back\ntoward the equator. I will even wait for one, if necessary, and will make the\nballoon like a ship that casts anchor, until favorable breezes come up.\u201d\n \nBut the foresight of the doctor was not long in bringing its reward; for, after\nhaving tried different heights, the Victoria at length began to sail off\nto the northeastward with medium speed.\n \n\u201cWe are in the right track,\u201d said the doctor, consulting his\ncompass, \u201cand scarcely two hundred feet from the surface; lucky\ncircumstances for us, enabling us, as they do, to reconnoitre these new\nregions. When Captain Speke set out to discover Lake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9, he ascended more\nto the eastward in a straight line above Kazeh.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we keep on long in this way?\u201d inquired the Scot.\n \n\u201cPerhaps. Our object is to push a point in the direction of the sources\nof the Nile; and we have more than six hundred miles to make before we get to\nthe extreme limit reached by the explorers who came from the north.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd we shan\u2019t set foot on the solid ground?\u201d murmured Joe;\n\u201cit\u2019s enough to cramp a fellow\u2019s legs!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, yes, indeed, my good Joe,\u201d said the doctor, reassuring him;\n\u201cwe have to economize our provisions, you know; and on the way, Dick, you\nmust get us some fresh meat.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhenever you like, doctor.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall also have to replenish our stock of water. Who knows but we may\nbe carried to some of the dried-up regions? So we cannot take too many\nprecautions.\u201d\n \nAt noon the Victoria was at twenty-nine degrees fifteen minutes east\nlongitude, and three degrees fifteen minutes south latitude. She passed the\nvillage of Uyofu, the last northern limit of the Unyamwezi, opposite to the\nLake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9, which could still be seen.\n \nThe tribes living near to the equator seem to be a little more civilized, and\nare governed by absolute monarchs, whose control is an unlimited despotism.\nTheir most compact union of power constitutes the province of Karagwah.\n \nIt was decided by the a\u00ebronauts that they would alight at the first favorable\nplace. They found that they should have to make a prolonged halt, and take a\ncareful inspection of the balloon: so the flame of the cylinder was moderated,\nand the anchors, flung out from the car, ere long began to sweep the grass of\nan immense prairie, that, from a certain height, looked like a shaven lawn, but\nthe growth of which, in reality, was from seven to eight feet in height.\n \nThe balloon skimmed this tall grass without bending it, like a gigantic\nbutterfly: not an obstacle was in sight; it was an ocean of verdure without a\nsingle breaker.\n \n\u201cWe might proceed a long time in this style,\u201d remarked Kennedy;\n\u201cI don\u2019t see one tree that we could approach, and I\u2019m afraid\nthat our hunt\u2019s over.\u201d\n \n\u201cWait, Dick; you could not hunt anyhow in this grass, that grows higher\nthan your head. We\u2019ll find a favorable place presently.\u201d\n \nIn truth, it was a charming excursion that they were making now\u2014a\nveritable navigation on this green, almost transparent sea, gently undulating\nin the breath of the wind. The little car seemed to cleave the waves of\nverdure, and, from time to time, coveys of birds of magnificent plumage would\nrise fluttering from the tall herbage, and speed away with joyous cries. The\nanchors plunged into this lake of flowers, and traced a furrow that closed\nbehind them, like the wake of a ship.\n \nAll at once a sharp shock was felt\u2014the anchor had caught in the fissure\nof some rock hidden in the high grass.\n \n\u201cWe are fast!\u201d exclaimed Joe.\n \nThese words had scarcely been uttered when a shrill cry rang through the air,\nand the following phrases, mingled with exclamations, escaped from the lips of\nour travellers:\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \n\u201cA strange cry!\u201d\n \n\u201cLook! Why, we\u2019re moving!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe anchor has slipped!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; it holds, and holds fast too!\u201d said Joe, who was tugging at\nthe rope.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the rock, then, that\u2019s moving!\u201d\n \nAn immense rustling was noticed in the grass, and soon an elongated, winding\nshape was seen rising above it.\n \n\u201cA serpent!\u201d shouted Joe.\n \n\u201cA serpent!\u201d repeated Kennedy, handling his rifle.\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cit\u2019s an elephant\u2019s\ntrunk!\u201d\n \n\u201cAn elephant, Samuel?\u201d\n \nAnd, as Kennedy said this, he drew his rifle to his shoulder.\n \n\u201cWait, Dick; wait!\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact! The animal\u2019s towing us!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd in the right direction, Joe\u2014in the right direction.\u201d\n \nThe elephant was now making some headway, and soon reached a clearing where his\nwhole body could be seen. By his gigantic size, the doctor recognized a male of\na superb species. He had two whitish tusks, beautifully curved, and about eight\nfeet in length; and in these the shanks of the anchor had firmly caught. The\nanimal was vainly trying with his trunk to disengage himself from the rope that\nattached him to the car.\n \n\u201cGet up\u2014go ahead, old fellow!\u201d shouted Joe, with delight,\ndoing his best to urge this rather novel team. \u201cHere is a new style of\ntravelling!\u2014no more horses for me. An elephant, if you please!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut where is he taking us to?\u201d said Kennedy, whose rifle itched in\nhis grasp.\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s taking us exactly to where we want to go, my dear Dick. A\nlittle patience!\u201d\n \n\u201c\u2018Wig-a-more! wig-a-more!\u2019 as the Scotch country folks\nsay,\u201d shouted Joe, in high glee. \u201cGee-up! gee-up there!\u201d\n \nThe huge animal now broke into a very rapid gallop. He flung his trunk from\nside to side, and his monstrous bounds gave the car several rather heavy\nthumps. Meanwhile the doctor stood ready, hatchet in hand, to cut the rope,\nshould need arise.\n \n\u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cwe shall not give up our anchor until the\nlast moment.\u201d\n \nThis drive, with an elephant for the team, lasted about an hour and a half; yet\nthe animal did not seem in the least fatigued. These immense creatures can go\nover a great deal of ground, and, from one day to another, are found at\nenormous distances from where they were last seen, like the whales, whose mass\nand speed they rival.\n \n\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Joe, \u201cit\u2019s a whale that we have\nharpooned; and we\u2019re only doing just what whalemen do when out\nfishing.\u201d\n \nBut a change in the nature of the ground compelled the doctor to vary his style\nof locomotion. A dense grove of calmadores was descried on the horizon,\nabout three miles away, on the north of the prairie. So it became necessary to\ndetach the balloon from its draught-animal at last.\n \nKennedy was intrusted with the job of bringing the elephant to a halt. He drew\nhis rifle to his shoulder, but his position was not favorable to a successful\nshot; so that the first ball fired flattened itself on the animal\u2019s\nskull, as it would have done against an iron plate. The creature did not seem\nin the least troubled by it; but, at the sound of the discharge, he had\nincreased his speed, and now was going as fast as a horse at full gallop.\n \n\u201cThe deuce!\u201d ejaculated Kennedy.\n \n\u201cWhat a solid head!\u201d commented Joe.\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll try some conical balls behind the shoulder-joint,\u201d\nsaid Kennedy, reloading his rifle with care. In another moment he fired.\n \nThe animal gave a terrible cry, but went on faster than ever.\n \n\u201cCome!\u201d said Joe, taking aim with another gun, \u201cI must help\nyou, or we\u2019ll never end it.\u201d And now two balls penetrated the\ncreature\u2019s side.\n \nThe elephant halted, lifted his trunk, and resumed his run toward the wood with\nall his speed; he shook his huge head, and the blood began to gush from his\nwounds.\n \n\u201cLet us keep up our fire, Mr. Kennedy.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd a continuous fire, too,\u201d urged the doctor, \u201cfor we are\nclose on the woods.\u201d\n \nTen shots more were discharged. The elephant made a fearful bound; the car and\nballoon cracked as though every thing were going to pieces, and the shock made\nthe doctor drop his hatchet on the ground.\n \nThe situation was thus rendered really very alarming; the anchor-rope, which\nhad securely caught, could not be disengaged, nor could it yet be cut by the\nknives of our a\u00ebronauts, and the balloon was rushing headlong toward the wood,\nwhen the animal received a ball in the eye just as he lifted his head. On this\nhe halted, faltered, his knees bent under him, and he uncovered his whole flank\nto the assaults of his enemies in the balloon.\n \n\u201cA bullet in his heart!\u201d said Kennedy, discharging one last\nrifle-shot.\n \nThe elephant uttered a long bellow of terror and agony, then raised himself up\nfor a moment, twirling his trunk in the air, and finally fell with all his\nweight upon one of his tusks, which he broke off short. He was dead.\n \n\u201cHis tusk\u2019s broken!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy\u2014\u201civory too\nthat in England would bring thirty-five guineas per hundred pounds.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs much as that?\u201d said Joe, scrambling down to the ground by the\nanchor-rope.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of sighing over it, Dick?\u201d said the doctor.\n\u201cAre we ivory merchants? Did we come hither to make money?\u201d\n \nJoe examined the anchor and found it solidly attached to the unbroken tusk. The\ndoctor and Dick leaped out on the ground, while the balloon, now half emptied,\nhovered over the body of the huge animal.\n \n\u201cWhat a splendid beast!\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cwhat a mass of flesh!\nI never saw an elephant of that size in India!\u201d\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing surprising about that, my dear Dick; the elephants\nof Central Africa are the finest in the world. The Andersons and the Cummings\nhave hunted so incessantly in the neighborhood of the Cape, that these animals\nhave migrated to the equator, where they are often met with in large\nherds.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the mean while, I hope,\u201d added Joe, \u201cthat we\u2019ll\ntaste a morsel of this fellow. I\u2019ll undertake to get you a good dinner at\nhis expense. Mr. Kennedy will go off and hunt for an hour or two; the doctor\nwill make an inspection of the balloon, and, while they\u2019re busy in that\nway, I\u2019ll do the cooking.\u201d\n \n\u201cA good arrangement!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cso do as you like,\nJoe.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs for me,\u201d said the hunter, \u201cI shall avail myself of the\ntwo hours\u2019 recess that Joe has condescended to let me have.\u201d\n \n\u201cGo, my friend, but no imprudence! Don\u2019t wander too far\naway.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever fear, doctor!\u201d and, so saying, Dick, shouldering his gun,\nplunged into the woods.\n \nForthwith Joe went to work at his vocation. At first he made a hole in the\nground two feet deep; this he filled with the dry wood that was so abundantly\nscattered about, where it had been strewn by the elephants, whose tracks could\nbe seen where they had made their way through the forest. This hole filled, he\nheaped a pile of fagots on it a foot in height, and set fire to it.\n \nThen he went back to the carcass of the elephant, which had fallen only about a\nhundred feet from the edge of the forest; he next proceeded adroitly to cut off\nthe trunk, which might have been two feet in diameter at the base; of this he\nselected the most delicate portion, and then took with it one of the\nanimal\u2019s spongy feet. In fact, these are the finest morsels, like the\nhump of the bison, the paws of the bear, and the head of the wild boar.\n \nWhen the pile of fagots had been thoroughly consumed, inside and outside, the\nhole, cleared of the cinders and hot coals, retained a very high temperature.\nThe pieces of elephant-meat, surrounded with aromatic leaves, were placed in\nthis extempore oven and covered with hot coals. Then Joe piled up a second heap\nof sticks over all, and when it had burned out the meat was cooked to a turn.\n \nThen Joe took the viands from the oven, spread the savory mess upon green\nleaves, and arranged his dinner upon a magnificent patch of greensward. He\nfinally brought out some biscuit, some coffee, and some cognac, and got a can\nof pure, fresh water from a neighboring streamlet.\n \nThe repast thus prepared was a pleasant sight to behold, and Joe, without being\ntoo proud, thought that it would also be pleasant to eat.\n \n\u201cA journey without danger or fatigue,\u201d he soliloquized; \u201cyour\nmeals when you please; a swinging hammock all the time! What more could a man\nask? And there was Kennedy, who didn\u2019t want to come!\u201d\n \nOn his part, Dr. Ferguson was engrossed in a serious and thorough examination\nof the balloon. The latter did not appear to have suffered from the storm; the\nsilk and the gutta percha had resisted wonderfully, and, upon estimating the\nexact height of the ground and the ascensional force of the balloon, our\na\u00ebronaut saw, with satisfaction, that the hydrogen was in exactly the same\nquantity as before. The covering had remained completely water-proof.\n \nIt was now only five days since our travellers had quitted Zanzibar; their\npemmican had not yet been touched; their stock of biscuit and potted meat was\nenough for a long trip, and there was nothing to be replenished but the water.\n \nThe pipes and spiral seemed to be in perfect condition, since, thanks to their\nindia-rubber jointings, they had yielded to all the oscillations of the\nballoon. His examination ended, the doctor betook himself to setting his notes\nin order. He made a very accurate sketch of the surrounding landscape, with its\nlong prairie stretching away out of sight, the forest of calmadores, and\nthe balloon resting motionless over the body of the dead elephant.\n \nAt the end of his two hours, Kennedy returned with a string of fat partridges\nand the haunch of an oryx, a sort of gemsbok belonging to the\nmost agile species of antelopes. Joe took upon himself to prepare this surplus\nstock of provisions for a later repast.\n \n\u201cBut, dinner\u2019s ready!\u201d he shouted in his most musical voice.\n \nAnd the three travellers had only to sit down on the green turf. The trunk and\nfeet of the elephant were declared to be exquisite. Old England was toasted, as\nusual, and delicious Havanas perfumed this charming country for the first time.\n \nKennedy ate, drank, and chatted, like four; he was perfectly delighted with his\nnew life, and seriously proposed to the doctor to settle in this forest, to\nconstruct a cabin of boughs and foliage, and, there and then, to lay the\nfoundation of a Robinson Crusoe dynasty in Africa.\n \nThe proposition went no further, although Joe had, at once, selected the part\nof Man Friday for himself.\n \nThe country seemed so quiet, so deserted, that the doctor resolved to pass the\nnight on the ground, and Joe arranged a circle of watch-fires as an\nindispensable barrier against wild animals, for the hyenas, cougars, and\njackals, attracted by the smell of the dead elephant, were prowling about in\nthe neighborhood. Kennedy had to fire his rifle several times at these\nunceremonious visitors, but the night passed without any untoward occurrence.\n",
        "\n\nThe Karagwah.\u2014Lake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9.\u2014A Night on an Island.\u2014The\nEquator.\u2014Crossing the Lake.\u2014The Cascades.\u2014A View of the\nCountry.\u2014The Sources of the Nile.\u2014The Island of Benga.\u2014The\nSignature of Andrea Debono.\u2014The Flag with the Arms of England.\n \nAt five o\u2019clock in the morning, preparations for departure commenced.\nJoe, with the hatchet which he had fortunately recovered, broke the\nelephant\u2019s tusks. The balloon, restored to liberty, sped away to the\nnorthwest with our travellers, at the rate of eighteen miles per hour.\n \nThe doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the stars,\nduring the preceding night. He knew that he was in latitude two degrees forty\nminutes below the equator, or at a distance of one hundred and sixty\ngeographical miles. He swept along over many villages without heeding the cries\nthat the appearance of the balloon excited; he took note of the conformation of\nplaces with quick sights; he passed the slopes of the Rubemhe, which are nearly\nas abrupt as the summits of the Ousagara, and, farther on, at Tenga,\nencountered the first projections of the Karagwah chains, which, in his\nopinion, are direct spurs of the Mountains of the Moon. So, the ancient legend\nwhich made these mountains the cradle of the Nile, came near to the truth,\nsince they really border upon Lake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9, the conjectured reservoir of the\nwaters of the great river.\n \nFrom Kafuro, the main district of the merchants of that country, he descried,\nat length, on the horizon, the lake so much desired and so long sought for, of\nwhich Captain Speke caught a glimpse on the 3d of August, 1858.\n \nSamuel Ferguson felt real emotion: he was almost in contact with one of the\nprincipal points of his expedition, and, with his spy-glass constantly raised,\nhe kept every nook and corner of the mysterious region in sight. His gaze\nwandered over details that might have been thus described:\n \n\u201cBeneath him extended a country generally destitute of cultivation; only\nhere and there some ravines seemed under tillage; the surface, dotted with\npeaks of medium height, grew flat as it approached the lake; barley-fields took\nthe place of rice-plantations, and there, too, could be seen growing the\nspecies of plantain from which the wine of the country is drawn, and\nmwani, the wild plant which supplies a substitute for coffee. A\ncollection of some fifty or more circular huts, covered with a flowering\nthatch, constituted the capital of the Karagwah country.\u201d\n \nHe could easily distinguish the astonished countenances of a rather\nfine-looking race of natives of yellowish-brown complexion. Women of incredible\ncorpulence were dawdling about through the cultivated grounds, and the doctor\ngreatly surprised his companions by informing them that this rotundity, which\nis highly esteemed in that region, was obtained by an obligatory diet of\ncurdled milk.\n \nAt noon, the Victoria was in one degree forty-five minutes south\nlatitude, and at one o\u2019clock the wind was driving her directly toward the\nlake.\n \nThis sheet of water was christened Uyanza Victoria, or Victoria Lake, by\nCaptain Speke. At the place now mentioned it might measure about ninety miles\nin breadth, and at its southern extremity the captain found a group of islets,\nwhich he named the Archipelago of Bengal. He pushed his survey as far as\nMuanza, on the eastern coast, where he was received by the sultan. He made a\ntriangulation of this part of the lake, but he could not procure a boat, either\nto cross it or to visit the great island of Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9 which is very populous, is\ngoverned by three sultans, and appears to be only a promontory at low tide.\n \nThe balloon approached the lake more to the northward, to the doctor\u2019s\ngreat regret, for it had been his wish to determine its lower outlines. Its\nshores seemed to be thickly set with brambles and thorny plants, growing\ntogether in wild confusion, and were literally hidden, sometimes, from the\ngaze, by myriads of mosquitoes of a light-brown hue. The country was evidently\nhabitable and inhabited. Troops of hippopotami could be seen disporting\nthemselves in the forests of reeds, or plunging beneath the whitish waters of\nthe lake.\n \nThe latter, seen from above, presented, toward the west, so broad an horizon\nthat it might have been called a sea; the distance between the two shores is so\ngreat that communication cannot be established, and storms are frequent and\nviolent, for the winds sweep with fury over this elevated and unsheltered\nbasin.\n \nThe doctor experienced some difficulty in guiding his course; he was afraid of\nbeing carried toward the east, but, fortunately, a current bore him directly\ntoward the north, and at six o\u2019clock in the evening the balloon alighted\non a small desert island in thirty minutes south latitude, and thirty-two\ndegrees fifty-two minutes east longitude, about twenty miles from the shore.\n \nThe travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree, and, the wind having fallen\ncalm toward evening, they remained quietly at anchor. They dared not dream of\ntaking the ground, since here, as on the shores of the Uyanza, legions of\nmosquitoes covered the soil in dense clouds. Joe even came back, from securing\nthe anchor in the tree, speckled with bites, but he kept his temper, because he\nfound it quite the natural thing for mosquitoes to treat him as they had done.\n \nNevertheless, the doctor, who was less of an optimist, let out as much rope as\nhe could, so as to escape these pitiless insects, that began to rise toward him\nwith a threatening hum.\n \nThe doctor ascertained the height of the lake above the level of the sea, as it\nhad been determined by Captain Speke, say three thousand seven hundred and\nfifty feet.\n \n\u201cHere we are, then, on an island!\u201d said Joe, scratching as though\nhe\u2019d tear his nails out.\n \n\u201cWe could make the tour of it in a jiffy,\u201d added Kennedy,\n\u201cand, excepting these confounded mosquitoes, there\u2019s not a living\nbeing to be seen on it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe islands with which the lake is dotted,\u201d replied the doctor,\n\u201care nothing, after all, but the tops of submerged hills; but we are\nlucky to have found a retreat among them, for the shores of the lake are\ninhabited by ferocious tribes. Take your sleep, then, since Providence has\ngranted us a tranquil night.\u201d\n \n\u201cWon\u2019t you do the same, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, I could not close my eyes. My thoughts would banish sleep.\nTo-morrow, my friends, should the wind prove favorable, we shall go due north,\nand we shall, perhaps, discover the sources of the Nile, that grand secret\nwhich has so long remained impenetrable. Near as we are to the sources of the\nrenowned river, I could not sleep.\u201d\n \nKennedy and Joe, whom scientific speculations failed to disturb to that extent,\nwere not long in falling into sound slumber, while the doctor held his post.\n \nOn Wednesday, April 23d, the balloon started at four o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, with a grayish sky overhead; night was slow in quitting the surface of\nthe lake, which was enveloped in a dense fog, but presently a violent breeze\nscattered all the mists, and, after the balloon had been swung to and fro for a\nmoment, in opposite directions, it at length veered in a straight line toward\nthe north.\n \nDr. Ferguson fairly clapped his hands for joy.\n \n\u201cWe are on the right track!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cTo-day or never\nwe shall see the Nile! Look, my friends, we are crossing the equator! We are\nentering our own hemisphere!\u201d\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d said Joe, \u201cdo you think, doctor, that the equator\npasses here?\u201d\n \n\u201cJust here, my boy!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, with all respect to you, sir, it seems to me that this is\nthe very time to moisten it.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d said the doctor, laughing. \u201cLet us have a glass of\npunch. You have a way of comprehending cosmography that is any thing but\ndull.\u201d\n \nAnd thus was the passage of the Victoria over the equator duly\ncelebrated.\n \nThe balloon made rapid headway. In the west could be seen a low and but\nslightly-diversified coast, and, farther away in the background, the elevated\nplains of the Uganda and the Usoga. At length, the rapidity of the wind became\nexcessive, approaching thirty miles per hour.\n \nThe waters of the Nyanza, violently agitated, were foaming like the billows of\na sea. By the appearance of certain long swells that followed the sinking of\nthe waves, the doctor was enabled to conclude that the lake must have great\ndepth of water. Only one or two rude boats were seen during this rapid passage.\n \n\u201cThis lake is evidently, from its elevated position, the natural\nreservoir of the rivers in the eastern part of Africa, and the sky gives back\nto it in rain what it takes in vapor from the streams that flow out of it. I am\ncertain that the Nile must here take its rise.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we shall see!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \nAbout nine o\u2019clock they drew nearer to the western coast. It seemed\ndeserted, and covered with woods; the wind freshened a little toward the east,\nand the other shore of the lake could be seen. It bent around in such a curve\nas to end in a wide angle toward two degrees forty minutes north latitude.\nLofty mountains uplifted their arid peaks at this extremity of Nyanza; but,\nbetween them, a deep and winding gorge gave exit to a turbulent and foaming\nriver.\n \nWhile busy managing the balloon, Dr. Ferguson never ceased reconnoitring the\ncountry with eager eyes.\n \n\u201cLook!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201clook, my friends! the statements of\nthe Arabs were correct! They spoke of a river by which Lake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9 discharged\nits waters toward the north, and this river exists, and we are descending it,\nand it flows with a speed analogous to our own! And this drop of water now\ngliding away beneath our feet is, beyond all question, rushing on, to mingle\nwith the Mediterranean! It is the Nile!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is the Nile!\u201d re\u00ebchoed Kennedy, carried away by the enthusiasm\nof his friend.\n \n\u201cHurrah for the Nile!\u201d shouted Joe, glad, and always ready to cheer\nfor something.\n \nEnormous rocks, here and there, embarrassed the course of this mysterious\nriver. The water foamed as it fell in rapids and cataracts, which confirmed the\ndoctor in his preconceived ideas on the subject. From the environing mountains\nnumerous torrents came plunging and seething down, and the eye could take them\nin by hundreds. There could be seen, starting from the soil, delicate jets of\nwater scattering in all directions, crossing and recrossing each other,\nmingling, contending in the swiftness of their progress, and all rushing toward\nthat nascent stream which became a river after having drunk them in.\n \n\u201cHere is, indeed, the Nile!\u201d reiterated the doctor, with the tone\nof profound conviction. \u201cThe origin of its name, like the origin of its\nwaters, has fired the imagination of the learned; they have sought to trace it\nfrom the Greek, the Coptic, the Sanscrit; but all that matters little now,\nsince we have made it surrender the secret of its source!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut,\u201d said the Scotchman, \u201chow are you to make sure of the\nidentity of this river with the one recognized by the travellers from the\nnorth?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall have certain, irrefutable, convincing, and infallible\nproof,\u201d replied Ferguson, \u201cshould the wind hold another hour in our\nfavor!\u201d\n \nThe mountains drew farther apart, revealing in their place numerous villages,\nand fields of white Indian corn, doura, and sugar-cane. The tribes inhabiting\nthe region seemed excited and hostile; they manifested more anger than\nadoration, and evidently saw in the a\u00ebronauts only obtrusive strangers, and not\ncondescending deities. It appeared as though, in approaching the sources of the\nNile, these men came to rob them of something, and so the Victoria had\nto keep out of range of their muskets.\n \n\u201cTo land here would be a ticklish matter!\u201d said the Scot.\n \n\u201cWell!\u201d said Joe, \u201cso much the worse for these natives.\nThey\u2019ll have to do without the pleasure of our conversation.\u201d\n \n\u201cNevertheless, descend I must,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cwere it\nonly for a quarter of an hour. Without doing so I cannot verify the results of\nour expedition.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is indispensable, then, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cIndispensable; and we will descend, even if we have to do so with a\nvolley of musketry.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe thing suits me,\u201d said Kennedy, toying with his pet rifle.\n \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m ready, master, whenever you say the word!\u201d added\nJoe, preparing for the fight.\n \n\u201cIt would not be the first time,\u201d remarked the doctor, \u201cthat\nscience has been followed up, sword in hand. The same thing happened to a\nFrench savant among the mountains of Spain, when he was measuring the\nterrestrial meridian.\u201d\n \n\u201cBe easy on that score, doctor, and trust to your two body-guards.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre we there, master?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot yet. In fact, I shall go up a little, first, in order to get an\nexact idea of the configuration of the country.\u201d\n \nThe hydrogen expanded, and in less than ten minutes the balloon was soaring at\na height of twenty-five hundred feet above the ground.\n \nFrom that elevation could be distinguished an inextricable network of smaller\nstreams which the river received into its bosom; others came from the west,\nfrom between numerous hills, in the midst of fertile plains.\n \n\u201cWe are not ninety miles from Gondokoro,\u201d said the doctor,\nmeasuring off the distance on his map, \u201cand less than five miles from the\npoint reached by the explorers from the north. Let us descend with great\ncare.\u201d\n \nAnd, upon this, the balloon was lowered about two thousand feet.\n \n\u201cNow, my friends, let us be ready, come what may.\u201d\n \n\u201cReady it is!\u201d said Dick and Joe, with one voice.\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d\n \nIn a few moments the balloon was advancing along the bed of the river, and\nscarcely one hundred feet above the ground. The Nile measured but fifty fathoms\nin width at this point, and the natives were in great excitement, rushing to\nand fro, tumultuously, in the villages that lined the banks of the stream. At\nthe second degree it forms a perpendicular cascade of ten feet in height, and\nconsequently impassable by boats.\n \n\u201cHere, then, is the cascade mentioned by Debono!\u201d exclaimed the\ndoctor.\n \nThe basin of the river spread out, dotted with numerous islands, which Dr.\nFerguson devoured with his eyes. He seemed to be seeking for a point of\nreference which he had not yet found.\n \nBy this time, some blacks, having ventured in a boat just under the balloon,\nKennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle, that made them regain the bank\nat their utmost speed.\n \n\u201cA good journey to you,\u201d bawled Joe, \u201cand if I were in your\nplace, I wouldn\u2019t try coming back again. I should be mightily afraid of a\nmonster that can hurl thunderbolts when he pleases.\u201d\n \nBut, all at once, the doctor snatched up his spy-glass, and directed it toward\nan island reposing in the middle of the river.\n \n\u201cFour trees!\u201d he exclaimed; \u201clook, down there!\u201d Sure\nenough, there were four trees standing alone at one end of it.\n \n\u201cIt is Bengal Island! It is the very same,\u201d repeated the doctor,\nexultingly.\n \n\u201cAnd what of that?\u201d asked Dick.\n \n\u201cIt is there that we shall alight, if God permits.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, it seems to be inhabited, doctor.\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe is right; and, unless I\u2019m mistaken, there is a group of about\na score of natives on it now.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll make them scatter; there\u2019ll be no great trouble in\nthat,\u201d responded Ferguson.\n \n\u201cSo be it,\u201d chimed in the hunter.\n \nThe sun was at the zenith as the balloon approached the island.\n \nThe blacks, who were members of the Makado tribe, were howling lustily, and one\nof them waved his bark hat in the air. Kennedy took aim at him, fired, and his\nhat flew about him in pieces. Thereupon there was a general scamper. The\nnatives plunged headlong into the river, and swam to the opposite bank.\nImmediately, there came a shower of balls from both banks, along with a perfect\ncloud of arrows, but without doing the balloon any damage, where it rested with\nits anchor snugly secured in the fissure of a rock. Joe lost no time in sliding\nto the ground.\n \n\u201cThe ladder!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cFollow me, Kennedy.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you wish, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us alight. I want a witness.\u201d\n \n\u201cHere I am!\u201d\n \n\u201cMind your post, Joe, and keep a good lookout.\u201d\n \n\u201cNever fear, doctor; I\u2019ll answer for all that.\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, Dick,\u201d said the doctor, as he touched the ground.\n \nSo saying, he drew his companion along toward a group of rocks that rose upon\none point of the island; there, after searching for some time, he began to\nrummage among the brambles, and, in so doing, scratched his hands until they\nbled.\n \nSuddenly he grasped Kennedy\u2019s arm, exclaiming: \u201cLook! look!\u201d\n \n\u201cLetters!\u201d\n \nYes; there, indeed, could be descried, with perfect precision of outline, some\nletters carved on the rock. It was quite easy to make them out:\n \n\u201cA. D.\u201d\n \n\u201cA.D.!\u201d repeated Dr. Ferguson. \u201cAndrea Debono\u2014the very\nsignature of the traveller who farthest ascended the current of the\nNile.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo doubt of that, friend Samuel,\u201d assented Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAre you now convinced?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is the Nile! We cannot entertain a doubt on that score now,\u201d\nwas the reply.\n \nThe doctor, for the last time, examined those precious initials, the exact form\nand size of which he carefully noted.\n \n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said he\u2014\u201cnow for the balloon!\u201d\n \n\u201cQuickly, then, for I see some of the natives getting ready to recross\nthe river.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat matters little to us now. Let the wind but send us northward for a\nfew hours, and we shall reach Gondokoro, and press the hands of some of our\ncountrymen.\u201d\n \nTen minutes more, and the balloon was majestically ascending, while Dr.\nFerguson, in token of success, waved the English flag triumphantly from his\ncar.\n",

I am sorry for it; but, at last, we have succeeded in\nconnecting the explorations from the east with those from the north; and we\nmust not complain.\u201d\n \nThe balloon was now receding gradually from the Nile.\n \n\u201cOne last look,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cat this impassable\nlatitude, beyond which the most intrepid travellers could not make their way.\nThere are those intractable tribes, of whom Petherick, Arnaud, Miuni, and the\nyoung traveller Lejean, to whom we are indebted for the best work on the Upper\nNile, have spoken.\u201d\n \n\u201cThus, then,\u201d added Kennedy, inquiringly, \u201cour discoveries\nagree with the speculations of science.\u201d\n \n\u201cAbsolutely so. The sources of the White Nile, of the Bahr-el-Abiad, are\nimmersed in a lake as large as a sea; it is there that it takes its rise.\nPoesy, undoubtedly, loses something thereby. People were fond of ascribing a\ncelestial origin to this king of rivers. The ancients gave it the name of an\nocean, and were not far from believing that it flowed directly from the sun;\nbut we must come down from these flights from time to time, and accept what\nscience teaches us. There will not always be scientific men, perhaps; but there\nalways will be poets.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe can still see cataracts,\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cThose are the cataracts of Makedo, in the third degree of latitude.\nNothing could be more accurate. Oh, if we could only have followed the course\nof the Nile for a few hours!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd down yonder, below us, I see the top of a mountain,\u201d said the\nhunter.\n \n\u201cThat is Mount Longwek, the Trembling Mountain of the Arabs. This\nwhole country was visited by Debono, who went through it under the name of\nLatif-Effendi. The tribes living near the Nile are hostile to each other, and\nare continually waging a war of extermination. You may form some idea, then, of\nthe difficulties he had to encounter.\u201d\n \nThe wind was carrying the balloon toward the northwest, and, in order to avoid\nMount Longwek, it was necessary to seek a more slanting current.\n \n\u201cMy friends,\u201d said the doctor, \u201chere is where our\npassage of the African Continent really commences; up to this time we have been\nfollowing the traces of our predecessors. Henceforth we are to launch ourselves\nupon the unknown. We shall not lack the courage, shall we?\u201d\n \n\u201cNever!\u201d said Dick and Joe together, almost in a shout.\n \n\u201cOnward, then, and may we have the help of Heaven!\u201d\n \nAt ten o\u2019clock at night, after passing over ravines, forests, and\nscattered villages, the a\u00ebronauts reached the side of the Trembling Mountain,\nalong whose gentle slopes they went quietly gliding. In that memorable day, the\n23d of April, they had, in fifteen hours, impelled by a rapid breeze, traversed\na distance of more than three hundred and fifteen miles.\n \nBut this latter part of the journey had left them in dull spirits, and complete\nsilence reigned in the car. Was Dr. Ferguson absorbed in the thought of his\ndiscoveries? Were his two companions thinking of their trip through those\nunknown regions? There were, no doubt, mingled with these reflections, the\nkeenest reminiscences of home and distant friends. Joe alone continued to\nmanifest the same careless philosophy, finding it quite natural that\nhome should not be there, from the moment that he left it; but he respected the\nsilent mood of his friends, the doctor and Kennedy.\n \nAbout ten the balloon anchored on the side of the Trembling Mountain, so\ncalled, because, in Arab tradition, it is said to tremble the instant that a\nMussulman sets foot upon it. The travellers then partook of a substantial meal,\nand all quietly passed the night as usual, keeping the regular watches.\n \nOn awaking the next morning, they all had pleasanter feelings. The weather was\nfine, and the wind was blowing from the right quarter; so that a good\nbreakfast, seasoned with Joe\u2019s merry pranks, put them in high good-humor.\n \nThe region they were now crossing is very extensive. It borders on the\nMountains of the Moon on one side, and those of Darfur on the other\u2014a\nspace about as broad as Europe.\n \n\u201cWe are, no doubt, crossing what is supposed to be the kingdom of Usoga.\nGeographers have pretended that there existed, in the centre of Africa, a vast\ndepression, an immense central lake. We shall see whether there is any truth in\nthat idea,\u201d said the doctor.\n \n\u201cBut how did they come to think so?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cFrom the recitals of the Arabs. Those fellows are great\nnarrators\u2014too much so, probably. Some travellers, who had got as far as\nKazeh, or the great lakes, saw slaves that had been brought from this region;\ninterrogated them concerning it, and, from their different narratives, made up\na jumble of notions, and deduced systems from them. Down at the bottom of it\nall there is some appearance of truth; and you see that they were right about\nthe sources of the Nile.\u201d\n \n\u201cNothing could be more correct,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cIt was by the\naid of these documents that some attempts at maps were made, and so I am going\nto try to follow our route by one of them, rectifying it when need be.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs all this region inhabited?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly; and disagreeably inhabited, too.\u201d\n \n\u201cI thought so.\u201d\n \n\u201cThese scattered tribes come, one and all, under the title of Nyam-Nyams,\nand this compound word is only a sort of nickname. It imitates the sound of\nchewing.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Excellent!\u201d said Joe, champing his teeth as\nthough he were eating; \u201cNyam-Nyam.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy good Joe, if you were the immediate object of this chewing, you\nwouldn\u2019t find it so excellent.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the reason, sir?\u201d\n \n\u201cThese tribes are considered man-eaters.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs that really the case?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot a doubt of it! It has also been asserted that these natives had\ntails, like mere quadrupeds; but it was soon discovered that these appendages\nbelonged to the skins of animals that they wore for clothing.\u201d\n \n\u201cMore\u2019s the pity! a tail\u2019s a nice thing to chase away\nmosquitoes.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat may be, Joe; but we must consign the story to the domain of fable,\nlike the dogs\u2019 heads which the traveller, Brun-Rollet, attributed to\nother tribes.\u201d\n \n\u201cDogs\u2019 heads, eh? Quite convenient for barking, and even for\nman-eating!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut one thing that has been, unfortunately, proven true, is, the\nferocity of these tribes, who are really very fond of human flesh, and devour\nit with avidity.\u201d\n \n\u201cI only hope that they won\u2019t take such a particular fancy to\nmine!\u201d said Joe, with comic solemnity.\n \n\u201cSee that!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes, indeed, sir; if I have to be eaten, in a moment of famine, I want\nit to be for your benefit and my master\u2019s; but the idea of feeding those\nblack fellows\u2014gracious! I\u2019d die of shame!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, Joe,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cthat\u2019s understood; we\ncount upon you in case of need!\u201d\n \n\u201cAt your service, gentlemen!\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe talks in this way so as to make us take good care of him, and fatten\nhim up.\u201d\n \n\u201cMaybe so!\u201d said Joe. \u201cEvery man for himself.\u201d\n \nIn the afternoon, the sky became covered with a warm mist, that oozed from the\nsoil; the brownish vapor scarcely allowed the beholder to distinguish objects,\nand so, fearing collision with some unexpected mountain-peak, the doctor, about\nfive o\u2019clock, gave the signal to halt.\n \nThe night passed without accident, but in such profound obscurity, that it was\nnecessary to use redoubled vigilance.\n \nThe monsoon blew with extreme violence during all the next morning. The wind\nburied itself in the lower cavities of the balloon and shook the appendage by\nwhich the dilating-pipes entered the main apparatus. They had, at last, to be\ntied up with cords, Joe acquitting himself very skilfully in performing that\noperation.\n \nHe had occasion to observe, at the same time, that the orifice of the balloon\nstill remained hermetically sealed.\n \n\u201cThat is a matter of double importance for us,\u201d said the doctor;\n\u201cin the first place, we avoid the escape of precious gas, and then,\nagain, we do not leave behind us an inflammable train, which we should at last\ninevitably set fire to, and so be consumed.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat would be a disagreeable travelling incident!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cShould we be hurled to the ground?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cHurled! No, not quite that. The gas would burn quietly, and we should\ndescend little by little. A similar accident happened to a French a\u00ebronaut,\nMadame Blanchard. She ignited her balloon while sending off fireworks, but she\ndid not fall, and she would not have been killed, probably, had not her car\ndashed against a chimney and precipitated her to the ground.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us hope that nothing of the kind may happen to us,\u201d said the\nhunter. \u201cUp to this time our trip has not seemed to me very dangerous,\nand I can see nothing to prevent us reaching our destination.\u201d\n \n\u201cNor can I either, my dear Dick; accidents are generally caused by the\nimprudence of the a\u00ebronauts, or the defective construction of their apparatus.\nHowever, in thousands of a\u00ebrial ascensions, there have not been twenty fatal\naccidents. Usually, the danger is in the moment of leaving the ground, or of\nalighting, and therefore at those junctures we should never omit the utmost\nprecaution.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s breakfast-time,\u201d said Joe; \u201cwe\u2019ll have to\nput up with preserved meat and coffee until Mr. Kennedy has had another chance\nto get us a good slice of venison.\u201d\n",

Tossed at one moment toward the north, at another toward the\nsouth, it could not find one steady current.\n \n\u201cWe are moving very swiftly without advancing much,\u201d said Kennedy,\nremarking the frequent oscillations of the needle of the compass.\n \n\u201cThe balloon is rushing at the rate of at least thirty miles an hour.\nLean over, and see how the country is gliding away beneath us!\u201d said the\ndoctor.\n \n\u201cSee! that forest looks as though it were precipitating itself upon\nus!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe forest has become a clearing!\u201d added the other.\n \n\u201cAnd the clearing a village!\u201d continued Joe, a moment or two later.\n\u201cLook at the faces of those astonished darkys!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! it\u2019s natural enough that they should be astonished,\u201d\nsaid the doctor. \u201cThe French peasants, when they first saw a balloon,\nfired at it, thinking that it was an a\u00ebrial monster. A Soudan negro may be\nexcused, then, for opening his eyes VERY wide!\u201d\n \n\u201cFaith!\u201d said Joe, as the Victoria skimmed closely along the\nground, at scarcely the elevation of one hundred feet, and immediately over a\nvillage, \u201cI\u2019ll throw them an empty bottle, with your leave, doctor,\nand if it reaches them safe and sound, they\u2019ll worship it; if it breaks,\nthey\u2019ll make talismans of the pieces.\u201d\n \nSo saying, he flung out a bottle, which, of course, was broken into a thousand\nfragments, while the negroes scampered into their round huts, uttering shrill\ncries.\n \nA little farther on, Kennedy called out: \u201cLook at that strange tree! The\nupper part is of one kind and the lower part of another!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell!\u201d said Joe, \u201chere\u2019s a country where the trees\ngrow on top of each other.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s simply the trunk of a fig-tree,\u201d replied the doctor,\n\u201con which there is a little vegetating earth. Some fine day, the wind\nleft the seed of a palm on it, and the seed has taken root and grown as though\nit were on the plain ground.\u201d\n \n\u201cA fine new style of gardening,\u201d said Joe, \u201cand I\u2019ll\nimport the idea to England. It would be just the thing in the London parks;\nwithout counting that it would be another way to increase the number of\nfruit-trees. We could have gardens up in the air; and the small house-owners\nwould like that!\u201d\n \nAt this moment, they had to raise the balloon so as to pass over a forest of\ntrees that were more than three hundred feet in height\u2014a kind of ancient\nbanyan.\n \n\u201cWhat magnificent trees!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy. \u201cI never saw any\nthing so fine as the appearance of these venerable forests. Look,\ndoctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe height of these banyans is really remarkable, my dear Dick; and yet,\nthey would be nothing astonishing in the New World.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, are there still loftier trees in existence?\u201d\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly; among the \u2018mammoth trees\u2019 of California, there\nis a cedar four hundred and eighty feet in height. It would overtop the Houses\nof Parliament, and even the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The trunk at the surface of\nthe ground was one hundred and twenty feet in circumference, and the concentric\nlayers of the wood disclosed an age of more than four thousand years.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut then, sir, there was nothing wonderful in it! When one has lived\nfour thousand years, one ought to be pretty tall!\u201d was Joe\u2019s\nremark.\n \nMeanwhile, during the doctor\u2019s recital and Joe\u2019s response, the\nforest had given place to a large collection of huts surrounding an open space.\nIn the middle of this grew a solitary tree, and Joe exclaimed, as he caught\nsight of it:\n \n\u201cWell! if that tree has produced such flowers as those, for the last four\nthousand years, I have to offer it my compliments, anyhow,\u201d and he\npointed to a gigantic sycamore, whose whole trunk was covered with human bones.\nThe flowers of which Joe spoke were heads freshly severed from the bodies, and\nsuspended by daggers thrust into the bark of the tree.\n \n\u201cThe war-tree of these cannibals!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cthe\nIndians merely carry off the scalp, but these negroes take the whole\nhead.\u201d\n \n\u201cA mere matter of fashion!\u201d said Joe. But, already, the village and\nthe bleeding heads were disappearing on the horizon. Another place offered a\nstill more revolting spectacle\u2014half-devoured corpses; skeletons\nmouldering to dust; human limbs scattered here and there, and left to feed the\njackals and hyenas.\n \n\u201cNo doubt, these are the bodies of criminals; according to the custom in\nAbyssinia, these people have left them a prey to the wild beasts, who kill them\nwith their terrible teeth and claws, and then devour them at their leisure.\n \n\u201cNot a whit more cruel than hanging!\u201d said the Scot;\n\u201cfilthier, that\u2019s all!\u201d\n \n\u201cIn the southern regions of Africa, they content themselves,\u201d\nresumed the doctor, \u201cwith shutting up the criminal in his own hut with\nhis cattle, and sometimes with his family. They then set fire to the hut, and\nthe whole party are burned together. I call that cruel; but, like friend\nKennedy, I think that the gallows is quite as cruel, quite as barbarous.\u201d\n \nJoe, by the aid of his keen sight, which he did not fail to use continually,\nnoticed some flocks of birds of prey flitting about the horizon.\n \n\u201cThey are eagles!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, after reconnoitring them\nthrough the glass, \u201cmagnificent birds, whose flight is as rapid as\nours.\u201d\n \n\u201cHeaven preserve us from their attacks!\u201d said the doctor,\n\u201cthey are more to be feared by us than wild beasts or savage\ntribes.\u201d\n \n\u201cBah!\u201d said the hunter, \u201cwe can drive them off with a few\nrifle-shots.\u201d\n \n\u201cNevertheless, I would prefer, dear Dick, not having to rely upon your\nskill, this time, for the silk of our balloon could not resist their sharp\nbeaks; fortunately, the huge birds will, I believe, be more frightened than\nattracted by our machine.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes! but a new idea, and I have dozens of them,\u201d said Joe;\n\u201cif we could only manage to capture a team of live eagles, we could hitch\nthem to the balloon, and they\u2019d haul us through the air!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe thing has been seriously proposed,\u201d replied the doctor,\n\u201cbut I think it hardly practicable with creatures naturally so\nrestive.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! we\u2019d tame them,\u201d said Joe. \u201cInstead of driving\nthem with bits, we\u2019d do it with eye-blinkers that would cover their eyes.\nHalf blinded in that way, they\u2019d go to the right or to the left, as we\ndesired; when blinded completely, they would stop.\u201d\n \n\u201cAllow me, Joe, to prefer a favorable wind to your team of eagles. It\ncosts less for fodder, and is more reliable.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, you may have your choice, master, but I stick to my idea.\u201d\n \nIt now was noon. The Victoria had been going at a more moderate speed\nfor some time; the country merely passed below it; it no longer flew.\n \nSuddenly, shouts and whistlings were heard by our a\u00ebronauts, and, leaning over\nthe edge of the car, they saw on the open plain below them an exciting\nspectacle.\n \nTwo hostile tribes were fighting furiously, and the air was dotted with volleys\nof arrows. The combatants were so intent upon their murderous work that they\ndid not notice the arrival of the balloon; there were about three hundred\nmingled confusedly in the deadly struggle: most of them, red with the blood of\nthe wounded, in which they fairly wallowed, were horrible to behold.\n \nAs they at last caught sight of the balloon, there was a momentary pause; but\ntheir yells redoubled, and some arrows were shot at the Victoria, one of\nthem coming close enough for Joe to catch it with his hand.\n \n\u201cLet us rise out of range,\u201d exclaimed the doctor; \u201cthere must\nbe no rashness! We are forbidden any risk.\u201d\n \nMeanwhile, the massacre continued on both sides, with battle-axes and\nwar-clubs; as quickly as one of the combatants fell, a hostile warrior ran up\nto cut off his head, while the women, mingling in the fray, gathered up these\nbloody trophies, and piled them together at either extremity of the\nbattle-field. Often, too, they even fought for these hideous spoils.\n \n\u201cWhat a frightful scene!\u201d said Kennedy, with profound disgust.\n \n\u201cThey\u2019re ugly acquaintances!\u201d added Joe; \u201cbut then, if\nthey had uniforms they\u2019d be just like the fighters of all the rest of the\nworld!\u201d\n \n\u201cI have a keen hankering to take a hand in at that fight,\u201d said the\nhunter, brandishing his rifle.\n \n\u201cNo! no!\u201d objected the doctor, vehemently; \u201cno, let us not\nmeddle with what don\u2019t concern us. Do you know which is right or which is\nwrong, that you would assume the part of the Almighty? Let us, rather, hurry\naway from this revolting spectacle. Could the great captains of the world float\nthus above the scenes of their exploits, they would at last, perhaps, conceive\na disgust for blood and conquest.\u201d\n \nThe chieftain of one of the contending parties was remarkable for his athletic\nproportions, his great height, and herculean strength. With one hand he plunged\nhis spear into the compact ranks of his enemies, and with the other mowed large\nspaces in them with his battle-axe. Suddenly he flung away his war-club, red\nwith blood, rushed upon a wounded warrior, and, chopping off his arm at a\nsingle stroke, carried the dissevered member to his mouth, and bit it again and\nagain.\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d ejaculated Kennedy, \u201cthe horrible brute! I can hold\nback no longer,\u201d and, as he spoke, the huge savage, struck full in the\nforehead with a rifle-ball, fell headlong to the ground.\n \nUpon this sudden mishap of their leader, his warriors seemed struck dumb with\namazement; his supernatural death awed them, while it reanimated the courage\nand ardor of their adversaries, and, in a twinkling, the field was abandoned by\nhalf the combatants.\n \n\u201cCome, let us look higher up for a current to bear us away. I am sick of\nthis spectacle,\u201d said the doctor.\n \nBut they could not get away so rapidly as to avoid the sight of the victorious\ntribe rushing upon the dead and the wounded, scrambling and disputing for the\nstill warm and reeking flesh, and eagerly devouring it.\n \n\u201cFaugh!\u201d uttered Joe, \u201cit\u2019s sickening.\u201d\n \nThe balloon rose as it expanded; the howlings of the brutal horde, in the\ndelirium of their orgy, pursued them for a few minutes; but, at length, borne\naway toward the south, they were carried out of sight and hearing of this\nhorrible spectacle of cannibalism.\n \nThe surface of the country was now greatly varied, with numerous streams of\nwater, bearing toward the east. The latter, undoubtedly, ran into those\naffluents of Lake Nu, or of the River of the Gazelles, concerning which M.\nGuillaume Lejean has given such curious details.\n \nAt nightfall, the balloon cast anchor in twenty-seven degrees east longitude,\nand four degrees twenty minutes north latitude, after a day\u2019s trip of one\nhundred and fifty miles.\n",
        "\n\nStrange Sounds.\u2014A Night Attack.\u2014Kennedy and Joe in the\nTree.\u2014Two Shots.\u2014\u201cHelp! help!\u201d\u2014Reply in\nFrench.\u2014The Morning.\u2014The Missionary.\u2014The Plan of Rescue.\n \nThe night came on very dark. The doctor had not been able to reconnoitre the\ncountry. He had made fast to a very tall tree, from which he could distinguish\nonly a confused mass through the gloom.\n \nAs usual, he took the nine-o\u2019clock watch, and at midnight Dick relieved\nhim.\n \n\u201cKeep a sharp lookout, Dick!\u201d was the doctor\u2019s good-night\ninjunction.\n \n\u201cIs there any thing new on the carpet?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo; but I thought that I heard vague sounds below us, and, as I\ndon\u2019t exactly know where the wind has carried us to, even an excess of\ncaution would do no harm.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard the cries of wild beasts.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! the sounds seemed to me something altogether different from that; at\nall events, on the least alarm don\u2019t fail to waken us.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll do so, doctor; rest easy.\u201d\n \nAfter listening attentively for a moment or two longer, the doctor, hearing\nnothing more, threw himself on his blankets and went asleep.\n \nThe sky was covered with dense clouds, but not a breath of air was stirring;\nand the balloon, kept in its place by only a single anchor, experienced not the\nslightest oscillation.\n \nKennedy, leaning his elbow on the edge of the car, so as to keep an eye on the\ncylinder, which was actively at work, gazed out upon the calm obscurity; he\neagerly scanned the horizon, and, as often happens to minds that are uneasy or\npossessed with preconceived notions, he fancied that he sometimes detected\nvague gleams of light in the distance.\n \nAt one moment he even thought that he saw them only two hundred paces away,\nquite distinctly, but it was a mere flash that was gone as quickly as it came,\nand he noticed nothing more. It was, no doubt, one of those luminous illusions\nthat sometimes impress the eye in the midst of very profound darkness.\n \nKennedy was getting over his nervousness and falling into his wandering\nmeditations again, when a sharp whistle pierced his ear.\n \nWas that the cry of an animal or of a night-bird, or did it come from human\nlips?\n \nKennedy, perfectly comprehending the gravity of the situation, was on the point\nof waking his companions, but he reflected that, in any case, men or animals,\nthe creatures that he had heard must be out of reach. So he merely saw that his\nweapons were all right, and then, with his night-glass, again plunged his gaze\ninto space.\n \nIt was not long before he thought he could perceive below him vague forms that\nseemed to be gliding toward the tree, and then, by the aid of a ray of\nmoonlight that shot like an electric flash between two masses of cloud, he\ndistinctly made out a group of human figures moving in the shadow.\n \nThe adventure with the dog-faced baboons returned to his memory, and he placed\nhis hand on the doctor\u2019s shoulder.\n \nThe latter was awake in a moment.\n \n\u201cSilence!\u201d said Dick. \u201cLet us speak below our breath.\u201d\n \n\u201cHas any thing happened?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, let us waken Joe.\u201d\n \nThe instant that Joe was aroused, Kennedy told him what he had seen.\n \n\u201cThose confounded monkeys again!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cPossibly, but we must be on our guard.\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe and I,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cwill climb down the tree by the\nladder.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd, in the meanwhile,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cI will take my\nmeasures so that we can ascend rapidly at a moment\u2019s warning.\u201d\n \n\u201cAgreed!\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us go down, then!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t use your weapons, excepting at the last extremity! It would\nbe a useless risk to make the natives aware of our presence in such a place as\nthis.\u201d\n \nDick and Joe replied with signs of assent, and then letting themselves slide\nnoiselessly toward the tree, took their position in a fork among the strong\nbranches where the anchor had caught.\n \nFor some moments they listened minutely and motionlessly among the foliage, and\nere long Joe seized Kennedy\u2019s hand as he heard a sort of rubbing sound\nagainst the bark of the tree.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you hear that?\u201d he whispered.\n \n\u201cYes, and it\u2019s coming nearer.\u201d\n \n\u201cSuppose it should be a serpent? That hissing or whistling that you heard\nbefore\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! there was something human in it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019d prefer the savages, for I have a horror of those\nsnakes.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe noise is increasing,\u201d said Kennedy, again, after a lapse of a\nfew moments.\n \n\u201cYes! something\u2019s coming up toward us\u2014climbing.\u201d\n \n\u201cKeep watch on this side, and I\u2019ll take care of the other.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery good!\u201d\n \nThere they were, isolated at the top of one of the larger branches shooting out\nin the midst of one of those miniature forests called baobab-trees. The\ndarkness, heightened by the density of the foliage, was profound; however, Joe,\nleaning over to Kennedy\u2019s ear and pointing down the tree, whispered:\n \n\u201cThe blacks! They\u2019re climbing toward us.\u201d\n \nThe two friends could even catch the sound of a few words uttered in the lowest\npossible tones.\n \nJoe gently brought his rifle to his shoulder as he spoke.\n \n\u201cWait!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \nSome of the natives had really climbed the baobab, and now they were seen\nrising on all sides, winding along the boughs like reptiles, and advancing\nslowly but surely, all the time plainly enough discernible, not merely to the\neye but to the nostrils, by the horrible odors of the rancid grease with which\nthey bedaub their bodies.\n \nEre long, two heads appeared to the gaze of Kennedy and Joe, on a level with\nthe very branch to which they were clinging.\n \n\u201cAttention!\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cFire!\u201d\n \nThe double concussion resounded like a thunderbolt and died away into cries of\nrage and pain, and in a moment the whole horde had disappeared.\n \nBut, in the midst of these yells and howls, a strange, unexpected\u2014nay\nwhat seemed an impossible\u2014cry had been heard! A human voice had,\ndistinctly, called aloud in the French language\u2014\n \n\u201cHelp! help!\u201d\n \nKennedy and Joe, dumb with amazement, had regained the car immediately.\n \n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d the doctor asked them.\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly, that supernatural cry, \u2018\u00c0 moi! \u00e0 moi!\u2019\ncomes from a Frenchman in the hands of these barbarians!\u201d\n \n\u201cA traveller.\u201d\n \n\u201cA missionary, perhaps.\u201d\n \n\u201cPoor wretch!\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cthey\u2019re assassinating\nhim\u2014making a martyr of him!\u201d\n \nThe doctor then spoke, and it was impossible for him to conceal his emotions.\n \n\u201cThere can be no doubt of it,\u201d he said; \u201csome unfortunate\nFrenchman has fallen into the hands of these savages. We must not leave this\nplace without doing all in our power to save him. When he heard the sound of\nour guns, he recognized an unhoped-for assistance, a providential\ninterposition. We shall not disappoint his last hope. Are such your\nviews?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are, doctor, and we are ready to obey you.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us, then, lay our heads together to devise some plan, and in the\nmorning we\u2019ll try to rescue him.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut how shall we drive off those abominable blacks?\u201d asked\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear to me, from the way in which they made off, that\nthey are unacquainted with fire-arms. We must, therefore, profit by their\nfears; but we shall await daylight before acting, and then we can form our\nplans of rescue according to circumstances.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe poor captive cannot be far off,\u201d said Joe,\n\u201cbecause\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cHelp! help!\u201d repeated the voice, but much more feebly this time.\n \n\u201cThe savage wretches!\u201d exclaimed Joe, trembling with indignation.\n\u201cSuppose they should kill him to-night!\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you hear, doctor,\u201d resumed Kennedy, seizing the doctor\u2019s\nhand. \u201cSuppose they should kill him to-night!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not at all likely, my friends. These savage tribes kill their\ncaptives in broad daylight; they must have the sunshine.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, if I were to take advantage of the darkness to slip down to the\npoor fellow?\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d said Joe, warmly.\n \n\u201cPause, my friends\u2014pause! The suggestion does honor to your hearts\nand to your courage; but you would expose us all to great peril, and do still\ngreater harm to the unfortunate man whom you wish to aid.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Kennedy. \u201cThese savages are frightened and\ndispersed: they will not return.\u201d\n \n\u201cDick, I implore you, heed what I say. I am acting for the common good;\nand if by any accident you should be taken by surprise, all would be\nlost.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, think of that poor wretch, hoping for aid, waiting there, praying,\ncalling aloud. Is no one to go to his assistance? He must think that his senses\ndeceived him; that he heard nothing!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe can reassure him, on that score,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson\u2014and,\nstanding erect, making a speaking-trumpet of his hands, he shouted at the top\nof his voice, in French: \u201cWhoever you are, be of good cheer! Three\nfriends are watching over you.\u201d\n \nA terrific howl from the savages responded to these words\u2014no doubt\ndrowning the prisoner\u2019s reply.\n \n\u201cThey are murdering him! they are murdering him!\u201d exclaimed\nKennedy. \u201cOur interference will have served no other purpose than to\nhasten the hour of his doom. We must act!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut how, Dick? What do you expect to do in the midst of this\ndarkness?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, if it was only daylight!\u201d sighed Joe.\n \n\u201cWell, and suppose it were daylight?\u201d said the doctor, in a\nsingular tone.\n \n\u201cNothing more simple, doctor,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cI\u2019d go\ndown and scatter all these savage villains with powder and ball!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you, Joe, what would you do?\u201d\n \n\u201cI, master? why, I\u2019d act more prudently, maybe, by telling the\nprisoner to make his escape in a certain direction that we\u2019d agree\nupon.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd how would you get him to know that?\u201d\n \n\u201cBy means of this arrow that I caught flying the other day. I\u2019d tie\na note to it, or I\u2019d just call out to him in a loud voice what you want\nhim to do, because these black fellows don\u2019t understand the language that\nyou\u2019d speak in!\u201d\n \n\u201cYour plans are impracticable, my dear friends. The greatest difficulty\nwould be for this poor fellow to escape at all\u2014even admitting that he\nshould manage to elude the vigilance of his captors. As for you, my dear Dick,\nwith determined daring, and profiting by their alarm at our fire-arms, your\nproject might possibly succeed; but, were it to fail, you would be lost, and we\nshould have two persons to save instead of one. No! we must put all the\nchances on our side, and go to work differently.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut let us act at once!\u201d said the hunter.\n \n\u201cPerhaps we may,\u201d said the doctor, throwing considerable stress\nupon the words.\n \n\u201cWhy, doctor, can you light up such darkness as this?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho knows, Joe?\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! if you can do that, you\u2019re the greatest learned man in the\nworld!\u201d\n \nThe doctor kept silent for a few moments; he was thinking. His two companions\nlooked at him with much emotion, for they were greatly excited by the\nstrangeness of the situation. Ferguson at last resumed:\n \n\u201cHere is my plan: We have two hundred pounds of ballast left, since the\nbags we brought with us are still untouched. I\u2019ll suppose that this\nprisoner, who is evidently exhausted by suffering, weighs as much as one of us;\nthere will still remain sixty pounds of ballast to throw out, in case we should\nwant to ascend suddenly.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow do you expect to manage the balloon?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThis is the idea, Dick: you will admit that if I can get to the\nprisoner, and throw out a quantity of ballast, equal to his weight, I shall\nhave in nowise altered the equilibrium of the balloon. But, then, if I want to\nget a rapid ascension, so as to escape these savages, I must employ means more\nenergetic than the cylinder. Well, then, in throwing out this overplus of\nballast at a given moment, I am certain to rise with great rapidity.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s plain enough.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes; but there is one drawback: it consists in the fact that, in order\nto descend after that, I should have to part with a quantity of gas\nproportionate to the surplus ballast that I had thrown out. Now, the gas is\nprecious; but we must not haggle over it when the life of a fellow-creature is\nat stake.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are right, sir; we must do every thing in our power to save\nhim.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us work, then, and get these bags all arranged on the rim of the\ncar, so that they may be thrown overboard at one movement.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut this darkness?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt hides our preparations, and will be dispersed only when they are\nfinished. Take care to have all our weapons close at hand. Perhaps we may have\nto fire; so we have one shot in the rifle; four for the two muskets; twelve in\nthe two revolvers; or seventeen in all, which might be fired in a quarter of a\nminute. But perhaps we shall not have to resort to all this noisy work. Are you\nready?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d responded Joe.\n \nThe sacks were placed as requested, and the arms were put in good order.\n \n\u201cVery good!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cHave an eye to every thing.\nJoe will see to throwing out the ballast, and Dick will carry off the prisoner;\nbut let nothing be done until I give the word. Joe will first detach the\nanchor, and then quickly make his way back to the car.\u201d\n \nJoe let himself slide down by the rope; and, in a few moments, reappeared at\nhis post; while the balloon, thus liberated, hung almost motionless in the air.\n \nIn the mean time the doctor assured himself of the presence of a sufficient\nquantity of gas in the mixing-tank to feed the cylinder, if necessary, without\nthere being any need of resorting for some time to the Buntzen battery. He then\ntook out the two perfectly-isolated conducting-wires, which served for the\ndecomposition of the water, and, searching in his travelling-sack, brought\nforth two pieces of charcoal, cut down to a sharp point, and fixed one at the\nend of each wire.\n \nHis two friends looked on, without knowing what he was about, but they kept\nperfectly silent. When the doctor had finished, he stood up erect in the car,\nand, taking the two pieces of charcoal, one in each hand, drew their points\nnearly together.\n \nIn a twinkling, an intense and dazzling light was produced, with an\ninsupportable glow between the two pointed ends of charcoal, and a huge jet of\nelectric radiance literally broke the darkness of the night.\n \n\u201cOh!\u201d ejaculated the astonished friends.\n \n\u201cNot a word!\u201d cautioned the doctor.\n",
        "\n\nThe Jet of Light.\u2014The Missionary.\u2014The Rescue in a Ray of\nElectricity.\u2014A Lazarist Priest.\u2014But little Hope.\u2014The\nDoctor\u2019s Care.\u2014A Life of Self-Denial.\u2014Passing a Volcano.\n \nDr. Ferguson darted his powerful electric jet toward various points of space,\nand caused it to rest on a spot from which shouts of terror were heard. His\ncompanions fixed their gaze eagerly on the place.\n \nThe baobab, over which the balloon was hanging almost motionless, stood in the\ncentre of a clearing, where, between fields of Indian-corn and sugar-cane, were\nseen some fifty low, conical huts, around which swarmed a numerous tribe.\n \nA hundred feet below the balloon stood a large post, or stake, and at its foot\nlay a human being\u2014a young man of thirty years or more, with long black\nhair, half naked, wasted and wan, bleeding, covered with wounds, his head bowed\nover upon his breast, as Christ\u2019s was, when He hung upon the cross.\n \nThe hair, cut shorter on the top of his skull, still indicated the place of a\nhalf-effaced tonsure.\n \n\u201cA missionary! a priest!\u201d exclaimed Joe.\n \n\u201cPoor, unfortunate man!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cWe must save him, Dick!\u201d responded the doctor; \u201cwe must save\nhim!\u201d\n \nThe crowd of blacks, when they saw the balloon over their heads, like a huge\ncomet with a train of dazzling light, were seized with a terror that may be\nreadily imagined. Upon hearing their cries, the prisoner raised his head. His\neyes gleamed with sudden hope, and, without too thoroughly comprehending what\nwas taking place, he stretched out his hands to his unexpected deliverers.\n \n\u201cHe is alive!\u201d exclaimed Ferguson. \u201cGod be praised! The\nsavages have got a fine scare, and we shall save him! Are you ready,\nfriends?\u201d\n \n\u201cReady, doctor, at the word.\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe, shut off the cylinder!\u201d\n \nThe doctor\u2019s order was executed. An almost imperceptible breath of air\nimpelled the balloon directly over the prisoner, at the same time that it\ngently lowered with the contraction of the gas. For about ten minutes it\nremained floating in the midst of luminous waves, for Ferguson continued to\nflash right down upon the throng his glowing sheaf of rays, which, here and\nthere, marked out swift and vivid sheets of light. The tribe, under the\ninfluence of an indescribable terror, disappeared little by little in the huts,\nand there was complete solitude around the stake. The doctor had, therefore,\nbeen right in counting upon the fantastic appearance of the balloon throwing\nout rays, as vivid as the sun\u2019s, through this intense gloom.\n \nThe car was approaching the ground; but a few of the savages, more audacious\nthan the rest, guessing that their victim was about to escape from their\nclutches, came back with loud yells, and Kennedy seized his rifle. The doctor,\nhowever, besought him not to fire.\n \nThe priest, on his knees, for he had not the strength to stand erect, was not\neven fastened to the stake, his weakness rendering that precaution superfluous.\nAt the instant when the car was close to the ground, the brawny Scot, laying\naside his rifle, and seizing the priest around the waist, lifted him into the\ncar, while, at the same moment, Joe tossed over the two hundred pounds of\nballast.\n \nThe doctor had expected to ascend rapidly, but, contrary to his calculations,\nthe balloon, after going up some three or four feet, remained there perfectly\nmotionless.\n \n\u201cWhat holds us?\u201d he asked, with an accent of terror.\n \nSome of the savages were running toward them, uttering ferocious cries.\n \n\u201cAh, ha!\u201d said Joe, \u201cone of those cursed blacks is hanging to\nthe car!\u201d\n \n\u201cDick! Dick!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cthe water-tank!\u201d\n \nKennedy caught his friend\u2019s idea on the instant, and, snatching up with\ndesperate strength one of the water-tanks weighing about one hundred pounds, he\ntossed it overboard. The balloon, thus suddenly lightened, made a leap of three\nhundred feet into the air, amid the howlings of the tribe whose prisoner thus\nescaped them in a blaze of dazzling light.\n \n\u201cHurrah!\u201d shouted the doctor\u2019s comrades.\n \nSuddenly, the balloon took a fresh leap, which carried it up to an elevation of\na thousand feet.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Kennedy, who had nearly lost his balance.\n \n\u201cOh! nothing; only that black villain leaving us!\u201d replied the\ndoctor, tranquilly, and Joe, leaning over, saw the savage that had clung to the\ncar whirling over and over, with his arms outstretched in the air, and\npresently dashed to pieces on the ground. The doctor then separated his\nelectric wires, and every thing was again buried in profound obscurity. It was\nnow one o\u2019clock in the morning.\n \nThe Frenchman, who had swooned away, at length opened his eyes.\n \n\u201cYou are saved!\u201d were the doctor\u2019s first words.\n \n\u201cSaved!\u201d he with a sad smile replied in English, \u201csaved from\na cruel death! My brethren, I thank you, but my days are numbered, nay, even my\nhours, and I have but little longer to live.\u201d\n \nWith this, the missionary, again yielding to exhaustion, relapsed into his\nfainting-fit.\n \n\u201cHe is dying!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the doctor, bending over him, \u201cbut he is very\nweak; so let us lay him under the awning.\u201d\n \nAnd they did gently deposit on their blankets that poor, wasted body, covered\nwith scars and wounds, still bleeding where fire and steel had, in twenty\nplaces, left their agonizing marks. The doctor, taking an old handkerchief,\nquickly prepared a little lint, which he spread over the wounds, after having\nwashed them. These rapid attentions were bestowed with the celerity and skill\nof a practised surgeon, and, when they were complete, the doctor, taking a\ncordial from his medicine-chest, poured a few drops upon his patient\u2019s\nlips.\n \nThe latter feebly pressed his kind hands, and scarcely had the strength to say,\n\u201cThank you! thank you!\u201d\n \nThe doctor comprehended that he must be left perfectly quiet; so he closed the\nfolds of the awning and resumed the guidance of the balloon.\n \nThe latter, after taking into account the weight of the new passenger, had been\nlightened of one hundred and eighty pounds, and therefore kept aloft without\nthe aid of the cylinder. At the first dawn of day, a current drove it gently\ntoward the west-northwest. The doctor went in under the awning for a moment or\ntwo, to look at his still sleeping patient.\n \n\u201cMay Heaven spare the life of our new companion! Have you any\nhope?\u201d said the Scot.\n \n\u201cYes, Dick, with care, in this pure, fresh atmosphere.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow that man has suffered!\u201d said Joe, with feeling. \u201cHe did\nbolder things than we\u2019ve done, in venturing all alone among those savage\ntribes!\u201d\n \n\u201cThat cannot be questioned,\u201d assented the hunter.\n \nDuring the entire day the doctor would not allow the sleep of his patient to be\ndisturbed. It was really a long stupor, broken only by an occasional murmur of\npain that continued to disquiet and agitate the doctor greatly.\n \nToward evening the balloon remained stationary in the midst of the gloom, and\nduring the night, while Kennedy and Joe relieved each other in carefully\ntending the sick man, Ferguson kept watch over the safety of all.\n \nBy the morning of the next day, the balloon had moved, but very slightly, to\nthe westward. The dawn came up pure and magnificent. The sick man was able to\ncall his friends with a stronger voice. They raised the curtains of the awning,\nand he inhaled with delight the keen morning air.\n \n\u201cHow do you feel to-day?\u201d asked the doctor.\n \n\u201cBetter, perhaps,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut you, my friends, I have\nnot seen you yet, excepting in a dream! I can, indeed, scarcely recall what has\noccurred. Who are you\u2014that your names may not be forgotten in my dying\nprayers?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are English travellers,\u201d replied Ferguson. \u201cWe are trying\nto cross Africa in a balloon, and, on our way, we have had the good fortune to\nrescue you.\u201d\n \n\u201cScience has its heroes,\u201d said the missionary.\n \n\u201cBut religion its martyrs!\u201d rejoined the Scot.\n \n\u201cAre you a missionary?\u201d asked the doctor.\n \n\u201cI am a priest of the Lazarist mission. Heaven sent you to\nme\u2014Heaven be praised! The sacrifice of my life had been accomplished! But\nyou come from Europe; tell me about Europe, about France! I have been without\nnews for the last five years!\u201d\n \n\u201cFive years! alone! and among these savages!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy\nwith amazement.\n \n\u201cThey are souls to redeem! ignorant and barbarous brethren, whom religion\nalone can instruct and civilize.\u201d\n \nDr. Ferguson, yielding to the priest\u2019s request, talked to him long and\nfully about France. He listened eagerly, and his eyes filled with tears. He\nseized Kennedy\u2019s and Joe\u2019s hands by turns in his own, which were\nburning with fever. The doctor prepared him some tea, and he drank it with\nsatisfaction. After that, he had strength enough to raise himself up a little,\nand smiled with pleasure at seeing himself borne along through so pure a sky.\n \n\u201cYou are daring travellers!\u201d he said, \u201cand you will succeed\nin your bold enterprise. You will again behold your relatives, your friends,\nyour country\u2014you\u2014\u201d\n \nAt this moment, the weakness of the young missionary became so extreme that\nthey had to lay him again on the bed, where a prostration, lasting for several\nhours, held him like a dead man under the eye of Dr. Ferguson. The latter could\nnot suppress his emotion, for he felt that this life now in his charge was\nebbing away. Were they then so soon to lose him whom they had snatched from an\nagonizing death? The doctor again washed and dressed the young martyr\u2019s\nfrightful wounds, and had to sacrifice nearly his whole stock of water to\nrefresh his burning limbs. He surrounded him with the tenderest and most\nintelligent care, until, at length, the sick man revived, little by little, in\nhis arms, and recovered his consciousness if not his strength.\n \nThe doctor was able to gather something of his history from his broken murmurs.\n \n\u201cSpeak in your native language,\u201d he said to the sufferer; \u201cI\nunderstand it, and it will fatigue you less.\u201d\n \nThe missionary was a poor young man from the village of Aradon, in Brittany, in\nthe Morbihan country. His earliest instincts had drawn him toward an\necclesiastical career, but to this life of self-sacrifice he was also desirous\nof joining a life of danger, by entering the mission of the order of priesthood\nof which St. Vincent de Paul was the founder, and, at twenty, he quitted his\ncountry for the inhospitable shores of Africa. From the sea-coast, overcoming\nobstacles, little by little, braving all privations, pushing onward, afoot, and\npraying, he had advanced to the very centre of those tribes that dwell among\nthe tributary streams of the Upper Nile. For two years his faith was spurned,\nhis zeal denied recognition, his charities taken in ill part, and he remained a\nprisoner to one of the cruelest tribes of the Nyambarra, the object of every\nspecies of maltreatment. But still he went on teaching, instructing, and\npraying. The tribe having been dispersed and he left for dead, in one of those\ncombats which are so frequent between the tribes, instead of retracing his\nsteps, he persisted in his evangelical mission. His most tranquil time was when\nhe was taken for a madman. Meanwhile, he had made himself familiar with the\nidioms of the country, and he catechised in them. At length, during two more\nlong years, he traversed these barbarous regions, impelled by that superhuman\nenergy that comes from God. For a year past he had been residing with that\ntribe of the Nyam-Nyams known as the Barafri, one of the wildest and\nmost ferocious of them all. The chief having died a few days before our\ntravellers appeared, his sudden death was attributed to the missionary, and the\ntribe resolved to immolate him. His sufferings had already continued for the\nspace of forty hours, and, as the doctor had supposed, he was to have perished\nin the blaze of the noonday sun. When he heard the sound of fire-arms, nature\ngot the best of him, and he had cried out, \u201cHelp! help!\u201d He then\nthought that he must have been dreaming, when a voice, that seemed to come from\nthe sky, had uttered words of consolation.\n \n\u201cI have no regrets,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the life that is passing\naway from me; my life belongs to God!\u201d\n \n\u201cHope still!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwe are near you, and we will\nsave you now, as we saved you from the tortures of the stake.\u201d\n \n\u201cI do not ask so much of Heaven,\u201d said the priest, with\nresignation. \u201cBlessed be God for having vouchsafed to me the joy before I\ndie of having pressed your friendly hands, and having heard, once more, the\nlanguage of my country!\u201d\n \nThe missionary here grew weak again, and the whole day went by between hope and\nfear, Kennedy deeply moved, and Joe drawing his hand over his eyes more than\nonce when he thought that no one saw him.\n \nThe balloon made little progress, and the wind seemed as though unwilling to\njostle its precious burden.\n \nToward evening, Joe discovered a great light in the west. Under more elevated\nlatitudes, it might have been mistaken for an immense aurora borealis, for the\nsky appeared on fire. The doctor very attentively examined the phenomenon.\n \n\u201cIt is, perhaps, only a volcano in full activity,\u201d said he.\n \n\u201cBut the wind is carrying us directly over it,\u201d replied Kennedy.\n \n\u201cVery well, we shall cross it then at a safe height!\u201d said the\ndoctor.\n \nThree hours later, the Victoria was right among the mountains. Her exact\nposition was twenty-four degrees fifteen minutes east longitude, and four\ndegrees forty-two minutes north latitude, and four degrees forty-two minutes\nnorth latitude. In front of her a volcanic crater was pouring forth torrents of\nmelted lava, and hurling masses of rock to an enormous height. There were jets,\ntoo, of liquid fire that fell back in dazzling cascades\u2014a superb but\ndangerous spectacle, for the wind with unswerving certainty was carrying the\nballoon directly toward this blazing atmosphere.\n \nThis obstacle, which could not be turned, had to be crossed, so the cylinder\nwas put to its utmost power, and the balloon rose to the height of six thousand\nfeet, leaving between it and the volcano a space of more than three hundred\nfathoms.\n \nFrom his bed of suffering, the dying missionary could contemplate that fiery\ncrater from which a thousand jets of dazzling flame were that moment escaping.\n \n\u201cHow grand it is!\u201d said he, \u201cand how infinite is the power of\nGod even in its most terrible manifestations!\u201d\n \nThis overflow of blazing lava wrapped the sides of the mountain with a\nveritable drapery of flame; the lower half of the balloon glowed redly in the\nupper night; a torrid heat ascended to the car, and Dr. Ferguson made all\npossible haste to escape from this perilous situation.\n \nBy ten o\u2019clock the volcano could be seen only as a red point on the\nhorizon, and the balloon tranquilly pursued her course in a less elevated zone\nof the atmosphere.\n",

His breathing, which was so feeble before,\nis growing weaker still, and I can do nothing to save him,\u201d said the\ndoctor, despairingly.\n \n\u201cThe infamous scoundrels!\u201d exclaimed Joe, grinding his teeth, in\none of those fits of rage that came over him at long intervals; \u201cand to\nthink that, in spite of all, this good man could find words only to pity them,\nto excuse, to pardon them!\u201d\n \n\u201cHeaven has given him a lovely night, Joe\u2014his last on earth,\nperhaps! He will suffer but little more after this, and his dying will be only\na peaceful falling asleep.\u201d\n \nThe dying man uttered some broken words, and the doctor at once went to him.\nHis breathing became difficult, and he asked for air. The curtains were drawn\nentirely back, and he inhaled with rapture the light breezes of that clear,\nbeautiful night. The stars sent him their trembling rays, and the moon wrapped\nhim in the white winding-sheet of its effulgence.\n \n\u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, in an enfeebled voice, \u201cI am going.\nMay God requite you, and bring you to your safe harbor! May he pay for me the\ndebt of gratitude that I owe to you!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou must still hope,\u201d replied Kennedy. \u201cThis is but a\npassing fit of weakness. You will not die. How could any one die on this\nbeautiful summer night?\u201d\n \n\u201cDeath is at hand,\u201d replied the missionary, \u201cI know it! Let\nme look it in the face! Death, the commencement of things eternal, is but the\nend of earthly cares. Place me upon my knees, my brethren, I beseech\nyou!\u201d\n \nKennedy lifted him up, and it was distressing to see his weakened limbs bend\nunder him.\n \n\u201cMy God! my God!\u201d exclaimed the dying apostle, \u201chave pity on\nme!\u201d\n \nHis countenance shone. Far above that earth on which he had known no joys; in\nthe midst of that night which sent to him its softest radiance; on the way to\nthat heaven toward which he uplifted his spirit, as though in a miraculous\nassumption, he seemed already to live and breathe in the new existence.\n \nHis last gesture was a supreme blessing on his new friends of only one day.\nThen he fell back into the arms of Kennedy, whose countenance was bathed in hot\ntears.\n \n\u201cDead!\u201d said the doctor, bending over him, \u201cdead!\u201d And\nwith one common accord, the three friends knelt together in silent prayer.\n \n\u201cTo-morrow,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cwe shall bury him in the\nAfrican soil which he has besprinkled with his blood.\u201d\n \nDuring the rest of the night the body was watched, turn by turn, by the three\ntravellers, and not a word disturbed the solemn silence. Each of them was\nweeping.\n \nThe next day the wind came from the south, and the balloon moved slowly over a\nvast plateau of mountains: there, were extinct craters; here, barren ravines;\nnot a drop of water on those parched crests; piles of broken rocks; huge stony\nmasses scattered hither and thither, and, interspersed with whitish marl, all\nindicated the most complete sterility.\n \nToward noon, the doctor, for the purpose of burying the body, decided to\ndescend into a ravine, in the midst of some plutonic rocks of primitive\nformation. The surrounding mountains would shelter him, and enable him to bring\nhis car to the ground, for there was no tree in sight to which he could make it\nfast.\n \nBut, as he had explained to Kennedy, it was now impossible for him to descend,\nexcept by releasing a quantity of gas proportionate to his loss of ballast at\nthe time when he had rescued the missionary. He therefore opened the valve of\nthe outside balloon. The hydrogen escaped, and the Victoria quietly\ndescended into the ravine.\n \nAs soon as the car touched the ground, the doctor shut the valve. Joe leaped\nout, holding on the while to the rim of the car with one hand, and with the\nother gathering up a quantity of stones equal to his own weight. He could then\nuse both hands, and had soon heaped into the car more than five hundred pounds\nof stones, which enabled both the doctor and Kennedy, in their turn, to get\nout. Thus the Victoria found herself balanced, and her ascensional force\ninsufficient to raise her.\n \nMoreover, it was not necessary to gather many of these stones, for the blocks\nwere extremely heavy, so much so, indeed, that the doctor\u2019s attention was\nattracted by the circumstance. The soil, in fact, was bestrewn with quartz and\nporphyritic rocks.\n \n\u201cThis is a singular discovery!\u201d said the doctor, mentally.\n \nIn the mean while, Kennedy and Joe had strolled away a few paces, looking up a\nproper spot for the grave. The heat was extreme in this ravine, shut in as it\nwas like a sort of furnace. The noonday sun poured down its rays\nperpendicularly into it.\n \nThe first thing to be done was to clear the surface of the fragments of rock\nthat encumbered it, and then a quite deep grave had to be dug, so that the wild\nanimals should not be able to disinter the corpse.\n \nThe body of the martyred missionary was then solemnly placed in it. The earth\nwas thrown in over his remains, and above it masses of rock were deposited, in\nrude resemblance to a tomb.\n \nThe doctor, however, remained motionless, and lost in his reflections. He did\nnot even heed the call of his companions, nor did he return with them to seek a\nshelter from the heat of the day.\n \n\u201cWhat are you thinking about, doctor?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAbout a singular freak of Nature, a curious effect of chance. Do you\nknow, now, in what kind of soil that man of self-denial, that poor one in\nspirit, has just been buried?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! what do you mean, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat priest, who took the oath of perpetual poverty, now reposes in a\ngold-mine!\u201d\n \n\u201cA gold-mine!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy and Joe in one breath.\n \n\u201cYes, a gold-mine,\u201d said the doctor, quietly. \u201cThose blocks\nwhich you are trampling under foot, like worthless stones, contain gold-ore of\ngreat purity.\u201d\n \n\u201cImpossible! impossible!\u201d repeated Joe.\n \n\u201cYou would not have to look long among those fissures of slaty schist\nwithout finding peptites of considerable value.\u201d\n \nJoe at once rushed like a crazy man among the scattered fragments, and Kennedy\nwas not long in following his example.\n \n\u201cKeep cool, Joe,\u201d said his master.\n \n\u201cWhy, doctor, you speak of the thing quite at your ease.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! a philosopher of your mettle\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cAh, master, no philosophy holds good in this case!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome! come! Let us reflect a little. What good would all this wealth do\nyou? We cannot carry any of it away with us.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe can\u2019t take any of it with us, indeed?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s rather too heavy for our car! I even hesitated to tell you\nany thing about it, for fear of exciting your regret!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Joe, again, \u201cabandon these treasures\u2014a\nfortune for us!\u2014really for us\u2014our own\u2014leave it behind!\u201d\n \n\u201cTake care, my friend! Would you yield to the thirst for gold? Has not\nthis dead man whom you have just helped to bury, taught you the vanity of human\naffairs?\u201d\n \n\u201cAll that is true,\u201d replied Joe, \u201cbut gold! Mr. Kennedy,\nwon\u2019t you help to gather up a trifle of all these millions?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat could we do with them, Joe?\u201d said the hunter, unable to\nrepress a smile. \u201cWe did not come hither in search of fortune, and we\ncannot take one home with us.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe millions are rather heavy, you know,\u201d resumed the doctor,\n\u201cand cannot very easily be put into one\u2019s pocket.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, at least,\u201d said Joe, driven to his last defences,\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t we take some of that ore for ballast, instead of\nsand?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery good! I consent,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cbut you must not\nmake too many wry faces when we come to throw some thousands of crowns\u2019\nworth overboard.\u201d\n \n\u201cThousands of crowns!\u201d echoed Joe; \u201cis it possible that there\nis so much gold in them, and that all this is the same?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, my friend, this is a reservoir in which Nature has been heaping up\nher wealth for centuries! There is enough here to enrich whole nations! An\nAustralia and a California both together in the midst of the wilderness!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the whole of it is to remain useless!\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps! but at all events, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do to console\nyou.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat would be rather difficult to do!\u201d said Joe, with a contrite\nair.\n \n\u201cListen! I will take the exact bearings of this spot, and give them to\nyou, so that, upon your return to England, you can tell our countrymen about\nit, and let them have a share, if you think that so much gold would make them\nhappy.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! master, I give up; I see that you are right, and that there is\nnothing else to be done. Let us fill our car with the precious mineral, and\nwhat remains at the end of the trip will be so much made.\u201d\n \nAnd Joe went to work. He did so, too, with all his might, and soon had\ncollected more than a thousand pieces of quartz, which contained gold enclosed\nas though in an extremely hard crystal casket.\n \nThe doctor watched him with a smile; and, while Joe went on, he took the\nbearings, and found that the missionary\u2019s grave lay in twenty-two degrees\ntwenty-three minutes east longitude, and four degrees fifty-five minutes north\nlatitude.\n \nThen, casting one glance at the swelling of the soil, beneath which the body of\nthe poor Frenchman reposed, he went back to his car.\n \nHe would have erected a plain, rude cross over the tomb, left solitary thus in\nthe midst of the African deserts, but not a tree was to be seen in the\nenvirons.\n \n\u201cGod will recognize it!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \nAn anxiety of another sort now began to steal over the doctor\u2019s mind. He\nwould have given much of the gold before him for a little water\u2014for he\nhad to replace what had been thrown overboard when the negro was carried up\ninto the air. But it was impossible to find it in these arid regions; and this\nreflection gave him great uneasiness. He had to feed his cylinder continually;\nand he even began to find that he had not enough to quench the thirst of his\nparty. Therefore he determined to lose no opportunity of replenishing his\nsupply.\n \nUpon getting back to the car, he found it burdened with the quartz-blocks that\nJoe\u2019s greed had heaped in it. He got in, however, without saying any\nthing. Kennedy took his customary place, and Joe followed, but not without\ncasting a covetous glance at the treasures in the ravine.\n \nThe doctor rekindled the light in the cylinder; the spiral became heated; the\ncurrent of hydrogen came in a few minutes, and the gas dilated; but the balloon\ndid not stir an inch.\n \nJoe looked on uneasily, but kept silent.\n \n\u201cJoe!\u201d said the doctor.\n \nJoe made no reply.\n \n\u201cJoe! Don\u2019t you hear me?\u201d\n \nJoe made a sign that he heard; but he would not understand.\n \n\u201cDo me the kindness to throw out some of that quartz!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, doctor, you gave me leave\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cI gave you leave to replace the ballast; that was all!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cDo you want to stay forever in this desert?\u201d\n \nJoe cast a despairing look at Kennedy; but the hunter put on the air of a man\nwho could do nothing in the matter.\n \n\u201cWell, Joe?\u201d\n \n\u201cThen your cylinder don\u2019t work,\u201d said the obstinate fellow.\n \n\u201cMy cylinder? It is lit, as you perceive. But the balloon will not rise\nuntil you have thrown off a little ballast.\u201d\n \nJoe scratched his ear, picked up a piece of quartz, the smallest in the lot,\nweighed and reweighed it, and tossed it up and down in his hand. It was a\nfragment of about three or four pounds. At last he threw it out.\n \nBut the balloon did not budge.\n \n\u201cHumph!\u201d said he; \u201cwe\u2019re not going up yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot yet,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cKeep on throwing.\u201d\n \nKennedy laughed. Joe now threw out some ten pounds, but the balloon stood\nstill.\n \nJoe got very pale.\n \n\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cMr. Kennedy, you and I\nweigh, unless I am mistaken, about four hundred pounds\u2014so that\nyou\u2019ll have to get rid of at least that weight, since it was put in here\nto make up for us.\u201d\n \n\u201cThrow away four hundred pounds!\u201d said Joe, piteously.\n \n\u201cAnd some more with it, or we can\u2019t rise. Come, courage,\nJoe!\u201d\n \nThe brave fellow, heaving deep sighs, began at last to lighten the balloon;\nbut, from time to time, he would stop, and ask:\n \n\u201cAre you going up?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d was the invariable response.\n \n\u201cIt moves!\u201d said he, at last.\n \n\u201cKeep on!\u201d replied the doctor.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going up; I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n \n\u201cKeep on yet,\u201d said Kennedy.\n \nAnd Joe, picking up one more block, desperately tossed it out of the car. The\nballoon rose a hundred feet or so, and, aided by the cylinder, soon passed\nabove the surrounding summits.\n \n\u201cNow, Joe,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cthere still remains a\nhandsome fortune for you; and, if we can only keep the rest of this with us\nuntil the end of our trip, there you are\u2014rich for the balance of your\ndays!\u201d\n \nJoe made no answer, but stretched himself out luxuriously on his heap of\nquartz.\n \n\u201cSee, my dear Dick!\u201d the doctor went on. \u201cJust see the power\nof this metal over the cleverest lad in the world! What passions, what greed,\nwhat crimes, the knowledge of such a mine as that would cause! It is sad to\nthink of it!\u201d\n \nBy evening the balloon had made ninety miles to the westward, and was, in a\ndirect line, fourteen hundred miles from Zanzibar.\n",
        "\n\nThe Wind dies away.\u2014The Vicinity of the Desert.\u2014The Mistake in the\nWater-Supply.\u2014The Nights of the Equator.\u2014Dr. Ferguson\u2019s\nAnxieties.\u2014The Situation flatly stated.\u2014Energetic Replies of\nKennedy and Joe.\u2014One Night more.\n \nThe balloon, having been made fast to a solitary tree, almost completely dried\nup by the aridity of the region in which it stood, passed the night in perfect\nquietness; and the travellers were enabled to enjoy a little of the repose\nwhich they so greatly needed. The emotions of the day had left sad impressions\non their minds.\n \nToward morning, the sky had resumed its brilliant purity and its heat. The\nballoon ascended, and, after several ineffectual attempts, fell into a current\nthat, although not rapid, bore them toward the northwest.\n \n\u201cWe are not making progress,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIf I am not\nmistaken, we have accomplished nearly half of our journey in ten days; but, at\nthe rate at which we are going, it would take months to end it; and that is all\nthe more vexatious, that we are threatened with a lack of water.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut we\u2019ll find some,\u201d said Joe. \u201cIt is not to be\nthought of that we shouldn\u2019t discover some river, some stream, or pond,\nin all this vast extent of country.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope so.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s Joe\u2019s cargo of stone\nthat is keeping us back?\u201d\n \nKennedy asked this question only to tease Joe; and he did so the more willingly\nbecause he had, for a moment, shared the poor lad\u2019s hallucinations; but,\nnot finding any thing in them, he had fallen back into the attitude of a\nstrong-minded looker-on, and turned the affair off with a laugh.\n \nJoe cast a mournful glance at him; but the doctor made no reply. He was\nthinking, not without secret terror, probably, of the vast solitudes of\nSahara\u2014for there whole weeks sometimes pass without the caravans meeting\nwith a single spring of water. Occupied with these thoughts, he scrutinized\nevery depression of the soil with the closest attention.\n \nThese anxieties, and the incidents recently occurring, had not been without\ntheir effect upon the spirits of our three travellers. They conversed less, and\nwere more wrapt in their own thoughts.\n \nJoe, clever lad as he was, seemed no longer the same person since his gaze had\nplunged into that ocean of gold. He kept entirely silent, and gazed incessantly\nupon the stony fragments heaped up in the car\u2014worthless to-day, but of\ninestimable value to-morrow.\n \nThe appearance of this part of Africa was, moreover, quite calculated to\ninspire alarm: the desert was gradually expanding around them; not another\nvillage was to be seen\u2014not even a collection of a few huts; and\nvegetation also was disappearing. Barely a few dwarf plants could now be\nnoticed, like those on the wild heaths of Scotland; then came the first tract\nof grayish sand and flint, with here and there a lentisk tree and brambles. In\nthe midst of this sterility, the rudimental carcass of the Globe appeared in\nridges of sharply-jutting rock. These symptoms of a totally dry and barren\nregion greatly disquieted Dr. Ferguson.\n \nIt seemed as though no caravan had ever braved this desert expanse, or it would\nhave left visible traces of its encampments, or the whitened bones of men and\nanimals. But nothing of the kind was to be seen, and the a\u00ebronauts felt that,\nere long, an immensity of sand would cover the whole of this desolate region.\n \nHowever, there was no going back; they must go forward; and, indeed, the doctor\nasked for nothing better; he would even have welcomed a tempest to carry him\nbeyond this country. But, there was not a cloud in the sky. At the close of the\nday, the balloon had not made thirty miles.\n \nIf there had been no lack of water! But, there remained only three gallons in\nall! The doctor put aside one gallon, destined to quench the burning thirst\nthat a heat of ninety degrees rendered intolerable. Two gallons only then\nremained to supply the cylinder. Hence, they could produce no more than four\nhundred and eighty cubic feet of gas; yet the cylinder consumed about nine\ncubic feet per hour. Consequently, they could not keep on longer than\nfifty-four hours\u2014and all this was a mathematical calculation!\n \n\u201cFifty-four hours!\u201d said the doctor to his companions.\n\u201cTherefore, as I am determined not to travel by night, for fear of\npassing some stream or pool, we have but three days and a half of journeying\nduring which we must find water, at all hazards. I have thought it my duty to\nmake you aware of the real state of the case, as I have retained only one\ngallon for drinking, and we shall have to put ourselves on the shortest\nallowance.\u201d\n \n\u201cPut us on short allowance, then, doctor,\u201d responded Kennedy,\n\u201cbut we must not despair. We have three days left, you say?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, my dear Dick!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, as grieving over the matter won\u2019t help us, in three days\nthere will be time enough to decide upon what is to be done; in the meanwhile,\nlet us redouble our vigilance!\u201d\n \nAt their evening meal, the water was strictly measured out, and the brandy was\nincreased in quantity in the punch they drank. But they had to be careful with\nthe spirits, the latter being more likely to produce than to quench thirst.\n \nThe car rested, during the night, upon an immense plateau, in which there was a\ndeep hollow; its height was scarcely eight hundred feet above the level of the\nsea. This circumstance gave the doctor some hope, since it recalled to his mind\nthe conjectures of geographers concerning the existence of a vast stretch of\nwater in the centre of Africa. But, if such a lake really existed, the point\nwas to reach it, and not a sign of change was visible in the motionless sky.\n \nTo the tranquil night and its starry magnificence succeeded the unchanging\ndaylight and the blazing rays of the sun; and, from the earliest dawn, the\ntemperature became scorching. At five o\u2019clock in the morning, the doctor\ngave the signal for departure, and, for a considerable time, the balloon\nremained immovable in the leaden atmosphere.\n \nThe doctor might have escaped this intense heat by rising into a higher range,\nbut, in order to do so, he would have had to consume a large quantity of water,\na thing that had now become impossible. He contented himself, therefore, with\nkeeping the balloon at one hundred feet from the ground, and, at that\nelevation, a feeble current drove it toward the western horizon.\n \nThe breakfast consisted of a little dried meat and pemmican. By noon, the\nVictoria had advanced only a few miles.\n \n\u201cWe cannot go any faster,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwe no longer\ncommand\u2014we have to obey.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! doctor, here is one of those occasions when a propeller would not be\na thing to be despised.\u201d\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly so, Dick, provided it would not require an expenditure of\nwater to put it in motion, for, in that case, the situation would be precisely\nthe same; moreover, up to this time, nothing practical of the sort has been\ninvented. Balloons are still at that point where ships were before the\ninvention of steam. It took six thousand years to invent propellers and screws;\nso we have time enough yet.\u201d\n \n\u201cConfounded heat!\u201d said Joe, wiping away the perspiration that was\nstreaming from his forehead.\n \n\u201cIf we had water, this heat would be of service to us, for it dilates the\nhydrogen in the balloon, and diminishes the amount required in the spiral,\nalthough it is true that, if we were not short of the useful liquid, we should\nnot have to economize it. Ah! that rascally savage who cost us the\ntank!\u201d[3]\n \n [3]\nThe water-tank had been thrown overboard when the native clung to the car.\n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t regret, though, what you did, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Dick, since it was in our power to save that unfortunate missionary\nfrom a horrible death. But, the hundred pounds of water that we threw overboard\nwould be very useful to us now; it would be thirteen or fourteen days more of\nprogress secured, or quite enough to carry us over this desert.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve made at least half the journey, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\nasked Joe.\n \n\u201cIn distance, yes; but in duration, no, should the wind leave us; and it,\neven now, has a tendency to die away altogether.\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, sir,\u201d said Joe, again, \u201cwe must not complain;\nwe\u2019ve got along pretty well, thus far, and whatever happens to me, I\ncan\u2019t get desperate. We\u2019ll find water; mind, I tell you so.\u201d\n \nThe soil, however, ran lower from mile to mile; the undulations of the\ngold-bearing mountains they had left died away into the plain, like the last\nthroes of exhausted Nature. Scanty grass took the place of the fine trees of\nthe east; only a few belts of half-scorched herbage still contended against the\ninvasion of the sand, and the huge rocks, that had rolled down from the distant\nsummits, crushed in their fall, had scattered in sharp-edged pebbles which soon\nagain became coarse sand, and finally impalpable dust.\n \n\u201cHere, at last, is Africa, such as you pictured it to yourself, Joe! Was\nI not right in saying, \u2018Wait a little?\u2019 eh?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, master, it\u2019s all natural, at least\u2014heat and dust. It\nwould be foolish to look for any thing else in such a country. Do you\nsee,\u201d he added, laughing, \u201cI had no confidence, for my part, in\nyour forests and your prairies; they were out of reason. What was the use of\ncoming so far to find scenery just like England? Here\u2019s the first time\nthat I believe in Africa, and I\u2019m not sorry to get a taste of it.\u201d\n \nToward evening, the doctor calculated that the balloon had not made twenty\nmiles during that whole burning day, and a heated gloom closed in upon it, as\nsoon as the sun had disappeared behind the horizon, which was traced against\nthe sky with all the precision of a straight line.\n \nThe next day was Thursday, the 1st of May, but the days followed each other\nwith desperate monotony. Each morning was like the one that had preceded it;\nnoon poured down the same exhaustless rays, and night condensed in its shadow\nthe scattered heat which the ensuing day would again bequeath to the succeeding\nnight. The wind, now scarcely observable, was rather a gasp than a breath, and\nthe morning could almost be foreseen when even that gasp would cease.\n \nThe doctor reacted against the gloominess of the situation and retained all the\ncoolness and self-possession of a disciplined heart. With his glass he\nscrutinized every quarter of the horizon; he saw the last rising ground\ngradually melting to the dead level, and the last vegetation disappearing,\nwhile, before him, stretched the immensity of the desert.\n \nThe responsibility resting upon him pressed sorely, but he did not allow his\ndisquiet to appear. Those two men, Dick and Joe, friends of his, both of them,\nhe had induced to come with him almost by the force alone of friendship and of\nduty. Had he done well in that? Was it not like attempting to tread forbidden\npaths? Was he not, in this trip, trying to pass the borders of the impossible?\nHad not the Almighty reserved for later ages the knowledge of this inhospitable\ncontinent?\n \nAll these thoughts, of the kind that arise in hours of discouragement,\nsucceeded each other and multiplied in his mind, and, by an irresistible\nassociation of ideas, the doctor allowed himself to be carried beyond the\nbounds of logic and of reason. After having established in his own mind what he\nshould not have done, the next question was, what he should do, then.\nWould it be impossible to retrace his steps? Were there not currents higher up\nthat would waft him to less arid regions? Well informed with regard to the\ncountries over which he had passed, he was utterly ignorant of those to come,\nand thus his conscience speaking aloud to him, he resolved, in his turn, to\nspeak frankly to his two companions. He thereupon laid the whole state of the\ncase plainly before them; he showed them what had been done, and what there was\nyet to do; at the worst, they could return, or attempt it, at least.\u2014What\ndid they think about it?\n \n\u201cI have no other opinion than that of my excellent master,\u201d said\nJoe; \u201cwhat he may have to suffer, I can suffer, and that better than he\ncan, perhaps. Where he goes, there I\u2019ll go!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd you, Kennedy?\u201d\n \n\u201cI, doctor, I\u2019m not the man to despair; no one was less ignorant\nthan I of the perils of the enterprise, but I did not want to see them, from\nthe moment that you determined to brave them. Under present circumstances, my\nopinion is, that we should persevere\u2014go clear to the end. Besides, to\nreturn looks to me quite as perilous as the other course. So onward, then! you\nmay count upon us!\u201d\n \n\u201cThanks, my gallant friends!\u201d replied the doctor, with much real\nfeeling, \u201cI expected such devotion as this; but I needed these\nencouraging words. Yet, once again, thank you, from the bottom of my\nheart!\u201d\n \nAnd, with this, the three friends warmly grasped each other by the hand.\n \n\u201cNow, hear me!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cAccording to my solar\nobservations, we are not more than three hundred miles from the Gulf of Guinea;\nthe desert, therefore, cannot extend indefinitely, since the coast is\ninhabited, and the country has been explored for some distance back into the\ninterior. If needs be, we can direct our course to that quarter, and it seems\nout of the question that we should not come across some oasis, or some well,\nwhere we could replenish our stock of water. But, what we want now, is the\nwind, for without it we are held here suspended in the air at a dead calm.\n \n\u201cLet us wait with resignation,\u201d said the hunter.\n \nBut, each of the party, in his turn, vainly scanned the space around him during\nthat long wearisome day. Nothing could be seen to form the basis of a hope. The\nvery last inequalities of the soil disappeared with the setting sun, whose\nhorizontal rays stretched in long lines of fire over the flat immensity. It was\nthe Desert!\n \nOur a\u00ebronauts had scarcely gone a distance of fifteen miles, having expended,\nas on the preceding day, one hundred and thirty-five cubic feet of gas to feed\nthe cylinder, and two pints of water out of the remaining eight had been\nsacrificed to the demands of intense thirst.\n \nThe night passed quietly\u2014too quietly, indeed, but the doctor did not\nsleep!\n",

The balloon rose to an elevation of five hundred feet, but it had\nscarcely changed its position to the westward in any perceptible degree.\n \n\u201cWe are right in the open desert,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cLook at\nthat vast reach of sand! What a strange spectacle! What a singular arrangement\nof nature! Why should there be, in one place, such extreme luxuriance of\nvegetation yonder, and here, this extreme aridity, and that in the same\nlatitude, and under the same rays of the sun?\u201d\n \n\u201cThe why concerns me but little,\u201d answered Kennedy, \u201cthe\nreason interests me less than the fact. The thing is so; that\u2019s the\nimportant part of it!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, it is well to philosophize a little, Dick; it does no harm.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us philosophize, then, if you will; we have time enough before us;\nwe are hardly moving; the wind is afraid to blow; it sleeps.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat will not last forever,\u201d put in Joe; \u201cI think I see some\nbanks of clouds in the east.\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe\u2019s right!\u201d said the doctor, after he had taken a look.\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cnow for our clouds, with a fine rain,\nand a fresh wind to dash it into our faces!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see, Dick, we\u2019ll see!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut this is Friday, master, and I\u2019m afraid of Fridays!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, I hope that this very day you\u2019ll get over those\nnotions.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope so, master, too. Whew!\u201d he added, mopping his face,\n\u201cheat\u2019s a good thing, especially in winter, but in summer it\ndon\u2019t do to take too much of it.\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you fear the effect of the sun\u2019s heat on our\nballoon?\u201d asked Kennedy, addressing the doctor.\n \n\u201cNo! the gutta-percha coating resists much higher temperatures than even\nthis. With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one hundred and\nfifty-eight degrees sometimes, and the covering does not appear to have\nsuffered.\u201d\n \n\u201cA cloud! a real cloud!\u201d shouted Joe at this moment, for that\npiercing eyesight of his beat all the glasses.\n \nAnd, in fact, a thick bank of vapor, now quite distinct, could be seen slowly\nemerging above the horizon. It appeared to be very deep, and, as it were,\npuffed out. It was, in reality, a conglomeration of smaller clouds. The latter\ninvariably retained their original formation, and from this circumstance the\ndoctor concluded that there was no current of air in their collected mass.\n \nThis compact body of vapor had appeared about eight o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, and, by eleven, it had already reached the height of the sun\u2019s\ndisk. The latter then disappeared entirely behind the murky veil, and the lower\nbelt of cloud, at the same moment, lifted above the line of the horizon, which\nwas again disclosed in a full blaze of daylight.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s only an isolated cloud,\u201d remarked the doctor. \u201cIt\nwon\u2019t do to count much upon that.\u201d\n \n\u201cLook, Dick, its shape is just the same as when we saw it this\nmorning!\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, doctor, there\u2019s to be neither rain nor wind, at least for\nus!\u201d\n \n\u201cI fear so; the cloud keeps at a great height.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it\nrefuses to burst upon us?\u201d\n \n\u201cI fancy that to do so wouldn\u2019t help us much; it would be a\nconsumption of gas, and, consequently, of water, to little purpose; but, in our\nsituation, we must not leave anything untried; therefore, let us ascend!\u201d\n \nAnd with this, the doctor put on a full head of flame from the cylinder, and\nthe dilation of the hydrogen, occasioned by such sudden and intense heat, sent\nthe balloon rapidly aloft.\n \nAbout fifteen hundred feet from the ground, it encountered an opaque mass of\ncloud, and entered a dense fog, suspended at that elevation; but it did not\nmeet with the least breath of wind. This fog seemed even destitute of humidity,\nand the articles brought in contact with it were scarcely dampened in the\nslightest degree. The balloon, completely enveloped in the vapor, gained a\nlittle increase of speed, perhaps, and that was all.\n \nThe doctor gloomily recognized what trifling success he had obtained from his\nman\u0153uvre, and was relapsing into deep meditation, when he heard Joe exclaim, in\ntones of most intense astonishment:\n \n\u201cAh! by all that\u2019s beautiful!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Joe?\u201d\n \n\u201cDoctor! Mr. Kennedy! Here\u2019s something curious!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are not alone, up here! There are rogues about! They\u2019ve stolen\nour invention!\u201d\n \n\u201cHas he gone crazy?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \nJoe stood there, perfectly motionless, the very picture of amazement.\n \n\u201cCan the hot sun have really affected the poor fellow\u2019s\nbrain?\u201d said the doctor, turning toward him.\n \n\u201cWill you tell me?\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cLook!\u201d said Joe, pointing to a certain quarter of the sky.\n \n\u201cBy St. James!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, in turn, \u201cwhy, who would\nhave believed it? Look, look! doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cI see it!\u201d said the doctor, very quietly.\n \n\u201cAnother balloon! and other passengers, like ourselves!\u201d\n \nAnd, sure enough, there was another balloon about two hundred paces from them,\nfloating in the air with its car and its a\u00ebronauts. It was following exactly\nthe same route as the Victoria.\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cnothing remains for us but to make\nsignals; take the flag, Kennedy, and show them our colors.\u201d\n \nIt seemed that the travellers by the other balloon had just the same idea, at\nthe same moment, for the same kind of flag repeated precisely the same salute\nwith a hand that moved in just the same manner.\n \n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThey are apes,\u201d said Joe, \u201cimitating us.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt means,\u201d said the doctor, laughing, \u201cthat it is you, Dick,\nyourself, making that signal to yourself; or, in other words, that we see\nourselves in the second balloon, which is no other than the\nVictoria.\u201d\n \n\u201cAs to that, master, with all respect to you,\u201d said Joe,\n\u201cyou\u2019ll never make me believe it.\u201d\n \n\u201cClimb up on the edge of the car, Joe; wave your arms, and then\nyou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n \nJoe obeyed, and all his gestures were instantaneously and exactly repeated.\n \n\u201cIt is merely the effect of the mirage,\u201d said the doctor,\n\u201cand nothing else\u2014a simple optical phenomenon due to the unequal\nrefraction of light by different layers of the atmosphere, and that is all.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Joe, who could not make up his mind to\nsurrender, but went on repeating his gesticulations.\n \n\u201cWhat a curious sight! Do you know,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cthat\nit\u2019s a real pleasure to have a view of our noble balloon in that style?\nShe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t she?\u2014and how stately her movements as\nshe sweeps along!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may explain the matter as you like,\u201d continued Joe,\n\u201cit\u2019s a strange thing, anyhow!\u201d\n \nBut ere long this picture began to fade away; the clouds rose higher, leaving\nthe balloon, which made no further attempt to follow them, and in about an hour\nthey disappeared in the open sky.\n \nThe wind, which had been scarcely perceptible, seemed still to diminish, and\nthe doctor in perfect desperation descended toward the ground, and all three of\nthe travellers, whom the incident just recorded had, for a few moments,\ndiverted from their anxieties, relapsed into gloomy meditation, sweltering the\nwhile beneath the scorching heat.\n \nAbout four o\u2019clock, Joe descried some object standing out against the\nvast background of sand, and soon was able to declare positively that there\nwere two palm-trees at no great distance.\n \n\u201cPalm-trees!\u201d exclaimed Ferguson; \u201cwhy, then there\u2019s a\nspring\u2014a well!\u201d\n \nHe took up his glass and satisfied himself that Joe\u2019s eyes had not been\nmistaken.\n \n\u201cAt length!\u201d he said, over and over again, \u201cwater! water! and\nwe are saved; for if we do move slowly, still we move, and we shall arrive at\nlast!\u201d\n \n\u201cGood, master! but suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time,\nfor this air is stifling?\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us drink then, my boy!\u201d\n \nNo one waited to be coaxed. A whole pint was swallowed then and there, reducing\nthe total remaining supply to three pints and a half.\n \n\u201cAh! that does one good!\u201d said Joe; \u201cwasn\u2019t it fine?\nBarclay and Perkins never turned out ale equal to that!\u201d\n \n\u201cSee the advantage of being put on short allowance!\u201d moralized the\ndoctor.\n \n\u201cIt is not great, after all,\u201d retorted Kennedy; \u201cand if I\nwere never again to have the pleasure of drinking water, I should agree on\ncondition that I should never be deprived of it.\u201d\n \nAt six o\u2019clock the balloon was floating over the palm-trees.\n \nThey were two shrivelled, stunted, dried-up specimens of trees\u2014two ghosts\nof palms\u2014without foliage, and more dead than alive. Ferguson examined\nthem with terror.\n \nAt their feet could be seen the half-worn stones of a spring, but these stones,\npulverized by the baking heat of the sun, seemed to be nothing now but\nimpalpable dust. There was not the slightest sign of moisture. The\ndoctor\u2019s heart shrank within him, and he was about to communicate his\nthoughts to his companions, when their exclamations attracted his attention. As\nfar as the eye could reach to the eastward, extended a long line of whitened\nbones; pieces of skeletons surrounded the fountain; a caravan had evidently\nmade its way to that point, marking its progress by its bleaching remains; the\nweaker had fallen one by one upon the sand; the stronger, having at length\nreached this spring for which they panted, had there found a horrible death.\n \nOur travellers looked at each other and turned pale.\n \n\u201cLet us not alight!\u201d said Kennedy, \u201clet us fly from this\nhideous spectacle! There\u2019s not a drop of water here!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Dick, as well pass the night here as elsewhere; let us have a clear\nconscience in the matter. We\u2019ll dig down to the very bottom of the well.\nThere has been a spring here, and perhaps there\u2019s something left in\nit!\u201d\n \nThe Victoria touched the ground; Joe and Kennedy put into the car a\nquantity of sand equal to their weight, and leaped out. They then hastened to\nthe well, and penetrated to the interior by a flight of steps that was now\nnothing but dust. The spring appeared to have been dry for years. They dug down\ninto a parched and powdery sand\u2014the very dryest of all sand,\nindeed\u2014there was not one trace of moisture!\n \nThe doctor saw them come up to the surface of the desert, saturated with\nperspiration, worn out, covered with fine dust, exhausted, discouraged and\ndespairing.\n \nHe then comprehended that their search had been fruitless. He had expected as\nmuch, and he kept silent, for he felt that, from this moment forth, he must\nhave courage and energy enough for three.\n \nJoe brought up with him some pieces of a leathern bottle that had grown hard\nand horn-like with age, and angrily flung them away among the bleaching bones\nof the caravan.\n \nAt supper, not a word was spoken by our travellers, and they even ate without\nappetite. Yet they had not, up to this moment, endured the real agonies of\nthirst, and were in no desponding mood, excepting for the future.\n",

The atmosphere was in a dead calm\u2014one of those calms which\nhold vessels captive in tropical seas. The heat had become intolerable; and the\nthermometer, in the shade under the awning, indicated one hundred and thirteen\ndegrees.\n \nJoe and Kennedy, reclining at full length near each other, tried, if not in\nslumber, at least in torpor, to forget their situation, for their forced\ninactivity gave them periods of leisure far from pleasant. That man is to be\npitied the most who cannot wean himself from gloomy reflections by actual work,\nor some practical pursuit. But here there was nothing to look after, nothing to\nundertake, and they had to submit to the situation, without having it in their\npower to ameliorate it.\n \nThe pangs of thirst began to be severely felt; brandy, far from appeasing this\nimperious necessity, augmented it, and richly merited the name of\n\u201ctiger\u2019s milk\u201d applied to it by the African natives. Scarcely\ntwo pints of water remained, and that was heated. Each of the party devoured\nthe few precious drops with his gaze, yet neither of them dared to moisten his\nlips with them. Two pints of water in the midst of the desert!\n \nThen it was that Dr. Ferguson, buried in meditation, asked himself whether he\nhad acted with prudence. Would he not have done better to have kept the water\nthat he had decomposed in pure loss, in order to sustain him in the air? He had\ngained a little distance, to be sure; but was he any nearer to his\njourney\u2019s end? What difference did sixty miles to the rear make in this\nregion, when there was no water to be had where they were? The wind, should it\nrise, would blow there as it did here, only less strongly at this point, if it\ncame from the east. But hope urged him onward. And yet those two gallons of\nwater, expended in vain, would have sufficed for nine days\u2019 halt in the\ndesert. And what changes might not have occurred in nine days! Perhaps, too,\nwhile retaining the water, he might have ascended by throwing out ballast, at\nthe cost merely of discharging some gas, when he had again to descend. But the\ngas in his balloon was his blood, his very life!\n \nA thousand one such reflections whirled in succession through his brain; and,\nresting his head between his hands, he sat there for hours without raising it.\n \n\u201cWe must make one final effort,\u201d he said, at last, about ten\no\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cWe must endeavor, just once more, to find\nan atmospheric current to bear us away from here, and, to that end, must risk\nour last resources.\u201d\n \nTherefore, while his companions slept, the doctor raised the hydrogen in the\nballoon to an elevated temperature, and the huge globe, filling out by the\ndilation of the gas, rose straight up in the perpendicular rays of the sun. The\ndoctor searched vainly for a breath of wind, from the height of one hundred\nfeet to that of five miles; his starting-point remained fatally right below\nhim, and absolute calm seemed to reign, up to the extreme limits of the\nbreathing atmosphere.\n \nAt length the feeding-supply of water gave out; the cylinder was extinguished\nfor lack of gas; the Buntzen battery ceased to work, and the balloon, shrinking\ntogether, gently descended to the sand, in the very place that the car had\nhollowed out there.\n \nIt was noon; and solar observations gave nineteen degrees thirty-five minutes\neast longitude, and six degrees fifty-one minutes north latitude, or nearly\nfive hundred miles from Lake Tchad, and more than four hundred miles from the\nwestern coast of Africa.\n \nOn the balloon taking ground, Kennedy and Joe awoke from their stupor.\n \n\u201cWe have halted,\u201d said the Scot.\n \n\u201cWe had to do so,\u201d replied the doctor, gravely.\n \nHis companions understood him. The level of the soil at that point corresponded\nwith the level of the sea, and, consequently, the balloon remained in perfect\nequilibrium, and absolutely motionless.\n \nThe weight of the three travellers was replaced with an equivalent quantity of\nsand, and they got out of the car. Each was absorbed in his own thoughts; and\nfor many hours neither of them spoke. Joe prepared their evening meal, which\nconsisted of biscuit and pemmican, and was hardly tasted by either of the\nparty. A mouthful of scalding water from their little store completed this\ngloomy repast.\n \nDuring the night none of them kept awake; yet none could be precisely said to\nhave slept. On the morrow there remained only half a pint of water, and this\nthe doctor put away, all three having resolved not to touch it until the last\nextremity.\n \nIt was not long, however, before Joe exclaimed:\n \n\u201cI\u2019m choking, and the heat is getting worse! I\u2019m not\nsurprised at that, though,\u201d he added, consulting the thermometer;\n\u201cone hundred and forty degrees!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe sand scorches me,\u201d said the hunter, \u201cas though it had\njust come out of a furnace; and not a cloud in this sky of fire. It\u2019s\nenough to drive one mad!\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us not despair,\u201d responded the doctor. \u201cIn this latitude\nthese intense heats are invariably followed by storms, and the latter come with\nthe suddenness of lightning. Notwithstanding this disheartening clearness of\nthe sky, great atmospheric changes may take place in less than an hour.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut,\u201d asked Kennedy, \u201cis there any sign whatever of\nthat?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cI think that there is some\nslight symptom of a fall in the barometer.\u201d\n \n\u201cMay Heaven hearken to you, Samuel! for here we are pinned to the ground,\nlike a bird with broken wings.\u201d\n \n\u201cWith this difference, however, my dear Dick, that our wings are unhurt,\nand I hope that we shall be able to use them again.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! wind! wind!\u201d exclaimed Joe; \u201cenough to carry us to a\nstream or a well, and we\u2019ll be all right. We have provisions enough, and,\nwith water, we could wait a month without suffering; but thirst is a cruel\nthing!\u201d\n \nIt was not thirst alone, but the unchanging sight of the desert, that fatigued\nthe mind. There was not a variation in the surface of the soil, not a hillock\nof sand, not a pebble, to relieve the gaze. This unbroken level discouraged the\nbeholder, and gave him that kind of malady called the\n\u201cdesert-sickness.\u201d The impassible monotony of the arid blue sky,\nand the vast yellow expanse of the desert-sand, at length produced a sensation\nof terror. In this inflamed atmosphere the heat appeared to vibrate as it does\nabove a blazing hearth, while the mind grew desperate in contemplating the\nlimitless calm, and could see no reason why the thing should ever end, since\nimmensity is a species of eternity.\n \nThus, at last, our hapless travellers, deprived of water in this torrid heat,\nbegan to feel symptoms of mental disorder. Their eyes swelled in their sockets,\nand their gaze became confused.\n \nWhen night came on, the doctor determined to combat this alarming tendency by\nrapid walking. His idea was to pace the sandy plain for a few hours, not in\nsearch of any thing, but simply for exercise.\n \n\u201cCome along!\u201d he said to his companions; \u201cbelieve me, it will\ndo you good.\u201d\n \n\u201cOut of the question!\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cI could not walk a\nstep.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Joe, \u201cwould rather sleep!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut sleep, or even rest, would be dangerous to you, my friends; you must\nreact against this tendency to stupor. Come with me!\u201d\n \nBut the doctor could do nothing with them, and, therefore, set off alone, amid\nthe starry clearness of the night. The first few steps he took were painful,\nfor they were the steps of an enfeebled man quite out of practice in walking.\nHowever, he quickly saw that the exercise would be beneficial to him, and\npushed on several miles to the westward. Once in rapid motion, he felt his\nspirits greatly cheered, when, suddenly, a vertigo came over him; he seemed to\nbe poised on the edge of an abyss; his knees bent under him; the vast solitude\nstruck terror to his heart; he found himself the minute mathematical point, the\ncentre of an infinite circumference, that is to say\u2014a nothing! The\nballoon had disappeared entirely in the deepening gloom. The doctor, cool,\nimpassible, reckless explorer that he was, felt himself at last seized with a\nnameless dread. He strove to retrace his steps, but in vain. He called aloud.\nNot even an echo replied, and his voice died out in the empty vastness of\nsurrounding space, like a pebble cast into a bottomless gulf; then, down he\nsank, fainting, on the sand, alone, amid the eternal silence of the desert.\n \nAt midnight he came to, in the arms of his faithful follower, Joe. The latter,\nuneasy at his master\u2019s prolonged absence, had set out after him, easily\ntracing him by the clear imprint of his feet in the sand, and had found him\nlying in a swoon.\n \n\u201cWhat has been the matter, sir?\u201d was the first inquiry.\n \n\u201cNothing, Joe, nothing! Only a touch of weakness, that\u2019s all.\nIt\u2019s over now.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! it won\u2019t amount to any thing, sir, I\u2019m sure of that; but\nget up on your feet, if you can. There! lean upon me, and let us get back to\nthe balloon.\u201d\n \nAnd the doctor, leaning on Joe\u2019s arm, returned along the track by which\nhe had come.\n \n\u201cYou were too bold, sir; it won\u2019t do to run such risks. You might\nhave been robbed,\u201d he added, laughing. \u201cBut, sir, come now, let us\ntalk seriously.\u201d\n \n\u201cSpeak! I am listening to you.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe must positively make up our minds to do something. Our present\nsituation cannot last more than a few days longer, and if we get no wind, we\nare lost.\u201d\n \nThe doctor made no reply.\n \n\u201cWell, then, one of us must sacrifice himself for the good of all, and it\nis most natural that it should fall to me to do so.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat have you to propose? What is your plan?\u201d\n \n\u201cA very simple one! It is to take provisions enough, and to walk right on\nuntil I come to some place, as I must do, sooner or later. In the mean time, if\nHeaven sends you a good wind, you need not wait, but can start again. For my\npart, if I come to a village, I\u2019ll work my way through with a few Arabic\nwords that you can write for me on a slip of paper, and I\u2019ll bring you\nhelp or lose my hide. What do you think of my plan?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is absolute folly, Joe, but worthy of your noble heart. The thing is\nimpossible. You will not leave us.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, sir, we must do something, and this plan can\u2019t do you any\nharm, for, I say again, you need not wait; and then, after all, I may\nsucceed.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo, Joe, no! We will not separate. That would only be adding sorrow to\ntrouble. It was written that matters should be as they are; and it is very\nprobably written that it shall be quite otherwise by-and-by. Let us wait, then,\nwith resignation.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo be it, master; but take notice of one thing: I give you a day longer,\nand I\u2019ll not wait after that. To-day is Sunday; we might say Monday, as\nit is one o\u2019clock in the morning, and if we don\u2019t get off by\nTuesday, I\u2019ll run the risk. I\u2019ve made up my mind to that!\u201d\n \nThe doctor made no answer, and in a few minutes they got back to the car, where\nhe took his place beside Kennedy, who lay there plunged in silence so complete\nthat it could not be considered sleep.\n",

He\nfound that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible depression.\n \n\u201cNothing!\u201d he murmured, \u201cnothing!\u201d\n \nHe got out of the car and scrutinized the weather; there was only the same\nheat, the same cloudless sky, the same merciless drought.\n \n\u201cMust we, then, give up to despair?\u201d he exclaimed, in agony.\n \nJoe did not open his lips. He was buried in his own thoughts, and planning the\nexpedition he had proposed.\n \nKennedy got up, feeling very ill, and a prey to nervous agitation. He was\nsuffering horribly with thirst, and his swollen tongue and lips could hardly\narticulate a syllable.\n \nThere still remained a few drops of water. Each of them knew this, and each was\nthinking of it, and felt himself drawn toward them; but neither of the three\ndared to take a step.\n \nThose three men, friends and companions as they were, fixed their haggard eyes\nupon each other with an instinct of ferocious longing, which was most plainly\nrevealed in the hardy Scot, whose vigorous constitution yielded the soonest to\nthese unnatural privations.\n \nThroughout the day he was delirious, pacing up and down, uttering hoarse cries,\ngnawing his clinched fists, and ready to open his veins and drink his own hot\nblood.\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d he cried, \u201cland of thirst! Well might you be called the\nland of despair!\u201d\n \nAt length he sank down in utter prostration, and his friends heard no other\nsound from him than the hissing of his breath between his parched and swollen\nlips.\n \nToward evening, Joe had his turn of delirium. The vast expanse of sand appeared\nto him an immense pond, full of clear and limpid water; and, more than once, he\ndashed himself upon the scorching waste to drink long draughts, and rose again\nwith his mouth clogged with hot dust.\n \n\u201cCurses on it!\u201d he yelled, in his madness, \u201cit\u2019s\nnothing but salt water!\u201d\n \nThen, while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless, the resistless longing\ncame over him to drain the last few drops of water that had been kept in\nreserve. The natural instinct proved too strong. He dragged himself toward the\ncar, on his knees; he glared at the bottle containing the precious fluid; he\ngave one wild, eager glance, seized the treasured store, and bore it to his\nlips.\n \nAt that instant he heard a heart-rending cry close beside\nhim\u2014\u201cWater! water!\u201d\n \nIt was Kennedy, who had crawled up close to him, and was begging there, upon\nhis knees, and weeping piteously.\n \nJoe, himself in tears, gave the poor wretch the bottle, and Kennedy drained the\nlast drop with savage haste.\n \n\u201cThanks!\u201d he murmured hoarsely, but Joe did not hear him, for both\nalike had dropped fainting on the sand.\n \nWhat took place during that fearful night neither of them knew, but, on Tuesday\nmorning, under those showers of heat which the sun poured down upon them, the\nunfortunate men felt their limbs gradually drying up, and when Joe attempted to\nrise he found it impossible.\n \nHe looked around him. In the car, the doctor, completely overwhelmed, sat with\nhis arms folded on his breast, gazing with idiotic fixedness upon some\nimaginary point in space. Kennedy was frightful to behold. He was rolling his\nhead from right to left like a wild beast in a cage.\n \nAll at once, his eyes rested on the butt of his rifle, which jutted above the\nrim of the car.\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d he screamed, raising himself with a superhuman effort.\n \nDesperate, mad, he snatched at the weapon, and turned the barrel toward his\nmouth.\n \n\u201cKennedy!\u201d shouted Joe, throwing himself upon his friend.\n \n\u201cLet go! hands off!\u201d moaned the Scot, in a hoarse, grating\nvoice\u2014and then the two struggled desperately for the rifle.\n \n\u201cLet go, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d repeated Kennedy. But Joe clung\nto him only the more fiercely, and they had been contending thus without the\ndoctor seeing them for many seconds, when, suddenly the rifle went off. At the\nsound of its discharge, the doctor rose up erect, like a spectre, and glared\naround him.\n \nBut all at once his glance grew more animated; he extended his hand toward the\nhorizon, and in a voice no longer human shrieked:\n \n\u201cThere! there\u2014off there!\u201d\n \nThere was such fearful force in the cry that Kennedy and Joe released each\nother, and both looked where the doctor pointed.\n \nThe plain was agitated like the sea shaken by the fury of a tempest; billows of\nsand went tossing over each other amid blinding clouds of dust; an immense\npillar was seen whirling toward them through the air from the southeast, with\nterrific velocity; the sun was disappearing behind an opaque veil of cloud\nwhose enormous barrier extended clear to the horizon, while the grains of fine\nsand went gliding together with all the supple ease of liquid particles, and\nthe rising dust-tide gained more and more with every second.\n \nFerguson\u2019s eyes gleamed with a ray of energetic hope.\n \n\u201cThe simoom!\u201d he exclaimed.\n \n\u201cThe simoom!\u201d repeated Joe, without exactly knowing what it meant.\n \n\u201cSo much the better!\u201d said Kennedy, with the bitterness of despair.\n\u201cSo much the better\u2014we shall die!\u201d\n \n\u201cSo much the better!\u201d echoed the doctor, \u201cfor we shall\nlive!\u201d and, so saying, he began rapidly to throw out the sand that\nencumbered the car.\n \nAt length his companions understood him, and took their places at his side.\n \n\u201cAnd now, Joe,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthrow out some fifty pounds\nof your ore, there!\u201d\n \nJoe no longer hesitated, although he still felt a fleeting pang of regret. The\nballoon at once began to ascend.\n \n\u201cIt was high time!\u201d said the doctor.\n \nThe simoom, in fact, came rushing on like a thunderbolt, and a moment later the\nballoon would have been crushed, torn to atoms, annihilated. The awful\nwhirlwind was almost upon it, and it was already pelted with showers of sand\ndriven like hail by the storm.\n \n\u201cOut with more ballast!\u201d shouted the doctor.\n \n\u201cThere!\u201d responded Joe, tossing over a huge fragment of quartz.\n \nWith this, the Victoria rose swiftly above the range of the whirling\ncolumn, but, caught in the vast displacement of the atmosphere thereby\noccasioned, it was borne along with incalculable rapidity away above this\nfoaming sea.\n \nThe three travellers did not speak. They gazed, and hoped, and even felt\nrefreshed by the breath of the tempest.\n \nAbout three o\u2019clock, the whirlwind ceased; the sand, falling again upon\nthe desert, formed numberless little hillocks, and the sky resumed its former\ntranquillity.\n \nThe balloon, which had again lost its momentum, was floating in sight of an\noasis, a sort of islet studded with green trees, thrown up upon the surface of\nthis sandy ocean.\n \n\u201cWater! we\u2019ll find water there!\u201d said the doctor.\n \nAnd, instantly, opening the upper valve, he let some hydrogen escape, and\nslowly descended, taking the ground at about two hundred feet from the edge of\nthe oasis.\n \nIn four hours the travellers had swept over a distance of two hundred and forty\nmiles!\n \nThe car was at once ballasted, and Kennedy, closely followed by Joe, leaped\nout.\n \n\u201cTake your guns with you!\u201d said the doctor; \u201ctake your guns,\nand be careful!\u201d\n \nDick grasped his rifle, and Joe took one of the fowling-pieces. They then\nrapidly made for the trees, and disappeared under the fresh verdure, which\nannounced the presence of abundant springs. As they hurried on, they had not\ntaken notice of certain large footprints and fresh tracks of some living\ncreature marked here and there in the damp soil.\n \nSuddenly, a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them.\n \n\u201cThe roar of a lion!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cGood for that!\u201d said the excited hunter; \u201cwe\u2019ll fight\nhim. A man feels strong when only a fight\u2019s in question.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut be careful, Mr. Kennedy; be careful! The lives of all depend upon\nthe life of one.\u201d\n \nBut Kennedy no longer heard him; he was pushing on, his eye blazing; his rifle\ncocked; fearful to behold in his daring rashness. There, under a palm-tree,\nstood an enormous black-maned lion, crouching for a spring on his antagonist.\nScarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter, when he bounded through the\nair; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet pierced his heart, and he\nfell to the earth dead.\n \n\u201cHurrah! hurrah!\u201d shouted Joe, with wild exultation.\n \nKennedy rushed toward the well, slid down the dampened steps, and flung himself\nat full length by the side of a fresh spring, in which he plunged his parched\nlips. Joe followed suit, and for some minutes nothing was heard but the sound\nthey made with their mouths, drinking more like maddened beasts than men.\n \n\u201cTake care, Mr. Kennedy,\u201d said Joe at last; \u201clet us not\noverdo the thing!\u201d and he panted for breath.\n \nBut Kennedy, without a word, drank on. He even plunged his hands, and then his\nhead, into the delicious tide\u2014he fairly revelled in its coolness.\n \n\u201cBut the doctor?\u201d said Joe; \u201cour friend, Dr. Ferguson?\u201d\n \nThat one word recalled Kennedy to himself, and, hastily filling a flask that he\nhad brought with him, he started on a run up the steps of the well.\n \nBut what was his amazement when he saw an opaque body of enormous dimensions\nblocking up the passage! Joe, who was close upon Kennedy\u2019s heels,\nrecoiled with him.\n \n\u201cWe are blocked in\u2014entrapped!\u201d\n \n\u201cImpossible! What does that mean?\u2014\u201d\n \nDick had no time to finish; a terrific roar made him only too quickly aware\nwhat foe confronted him.\n \n\u201cAnother lion!\u201d exclaimed Joe.\n \n\u201cA lioness, rather,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cAh! ferocious\nbrute!\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ll settle you in a moment more!\u201d\nand swiftly reloaded his rifle.\n \nIn another instant he fired, but the animal had disappeared.\n \n\u201cOnward!\u201d shouted Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNo!\u201d interposed the other, \u201cthat shot did not kill her; her\nbody would have rolled down the steps; she\u2019s up there, ready to spring\nupon the first of us who appears, and he would be a lost man!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what are we to do? We must get out of this, and the doctor is\nexpecting us.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us decoy the animal. Take my piece, and give me your rifle.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n \nAnd Joe, taking off his linen jacket, hung it on the end of the rifle, and\nthrust it above the top of the steps. The lioness flung herself furiously upon\nit. Kennedy was on the alert for her, and his bullet broke her shoulder. The\nlioness, with a frightful howl of agony, rolled down the steps, overturning Joe\nin her fall. The poor fellow imagined that he could already feel the enormous\npaws of the savage beast in his flesh, when a second detonation resounded in\nthe narrow passage, and Dr. Ferguson appeared at the opening above with his gun\nin hand, and still smoking from the discharge.\n \nJoe leaped to his feet, clambered over the body of the dead lioness, and handed\nup the flask full of sparkling water to his master.\n \nTo carry it to his lips, and to half empty it at a draught, was the work of an\ninstant, and the three travellers offered up thanks from the depths of their\nhearts to that Providence who had so miraculously saved them.\n",

He had ransacked\nevery thicket and satisfied himself that the balloon party were the only living\ncreatures in this terrestrial paradise; so they stretched themselves upon their\nblankets and passed a peaceful night that brought them forgetfulness of their\npast sufferings.\n \nOn the morrow, May 7th, the sun shone with all his splendor, but his rays could\nnot penetrate the dense screen of the palm-tree foliage, and as there was no\nlack of provisions, the doctor resolved to remain where he was while waiting\nfor a favorable wind.\n \nJoe had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis, and proceeded to indulge in\nany number of culinary combinations, using water all the time with the most\nprofuse extravagance.\n \n\u201cWhat a strange succession of annoyances and enjoyments!\u201d moralized\nKennedy. \u201cSuch abundance as this after such privations; such luxury after\nsuch want! Ah! I nearly went mad!\u201d\n \n\u201cMy dear Dick,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201chad it not been for Joe,\nyou would not be sitting here, to-day, discoursing on the instability of human\naffairs.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhole-hearted friend!\u201d said Kennedy, extending his hand to Joe.\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no occasion for all that,\u201d responded the latter;\n\u201cbut you can take your revenge some time, Mr. Kennedy, always hoping\nthough that you may never have occasion to do the same for me!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a poor constitution this of ours to succumb to so\nlittle,\u201d philosophized Dr. Ferguson.\n \n\u201cSo little water, you mean, doctor,\u201d interposed Joe; \u201cthat\nelement must be very necessary to life.\u201d\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly, and persons deprived of food hold out longer than those\ndeprived of water.\u201d\n \n\u201cI believe it. Besides, when needs must, one can eat any thing he comes\nacross, even his fellow-creatures, although that must be a kind of food\nthat\u2019s pretty hard to digest.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe savages don\u2019t boggle much about it!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes; but then they are savages, and accustomed to devouring raw meat;\nit\u2019s something that I\u2019d find very disgusting, for my part.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is disgusting enough,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthat\u2019s a\nfact; and so much so, indeed, that nobody believed the narratives of the\nearliest travellers in Africa who brought back word that many tribes on that\ncontinent subsisted upon raw meat, and people generally refused to credit the\nstatement. It was under such circumstances that a very singular adventure\nbefell James Bruce.\u201d\n \n\u201cTell it to us, doctor; we\u2019ve time enough to hear it,\u201d said\nJoe, stretching himself voluptuously on the cool greensward.\n \n\u201cBy all means.\u2014James Bruce was a Scotchman, of Stirlingshire, who,\nbetween 1768 and 1772, traversed all Abyssinia, as far as Lake Tyana, in search\nof the sources of the Nile. He afterward returned to England, but did not\npublish an account of his journeys until 1790. His statements were received\nwith extreme incredulity, and such may be the reception accorded to our own.\nThe manners and customs of the Abyssinians seemed so different from those of\nthe English, that no one would credit the description of them. Among other\ndetails, Bruce had put forward the assertion that the tribes of Eastern Africa\nfed upon raw flesh, and this set everybody against him. He might say so as much\nas he pleased; there was no one likely to go and see! One day, in a parlor at\nEdinburgh, a Scotch gentleman took up the subject in his presence, as it had\nbecome the topic of daily pleasantry, and, in reference to the eating of raw\nflesh, said that the thing was neither possible nor true. Bruce made no reply,\nbut went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak, seasoned with\npepper and salt, in the African style.\n \n\u201c\u2018Sir,\u2019 said he to the Scotchman, \u2018in doubting my\nstatements, you have grossly affronted me; in believing the thing to be\nimpossible, you have been egregiously mistaken; and, in proof thereof, you will\nnow eat this beef-steak raw, or you will give me instant satisfaction!\u2019\nThe Scotchman had a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller, and did eat\nthe steak, although not without a good many wry faces. Thereupon, with the\nutmost coolness, James Bruce added: \u2018Even admitting, sir, that the thing\nwere untrue, you will, at least, no longer maintain that it is\nimpossible.\u2019\u201d\n \n\u201cWell put in!\u201d said Joe, \u201cand if the Scotchman found it lie\nheavy on his stomach, he got no more than he deserved. If, on our return to\nEngland, they dare to doubt what we say about our travels\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, Joe, what would you do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, I\u2019ll make the doubters swallow the pieces of the balloon,\nwithout either salt or pepper!\u201d\n \nAll burst out laughing at Joe\u2019s queer notions, and thus the day slipped\nby in pleasant chat. With returning strength, hope had revived, and with hope\ncame the courage to do and to dare. The past was obliterated in the presence of\nthe future with providential rapidity.\n \nJoe would have been willing to remain forever in this enchanting asylum; it was\nthe realm he had pictured in his dreams; he felt himself at home; his master\nhad to give him his exact location, and it was with the gravest air imaginable\nthat he wrote down on his tablets fifteen degrees forty-three minutes east\nlongitude, and eight degrees thirty-two minutes north latitude.\n \nKennedy had but one regret, to wit, that he could not hunt in that miniature\nforest, because, according to his ideas, there was a slight deficiency of\nferocious wild beasts in it.\n \n\u201cBut, my dear Dick,\u201d said the doctor, \u201chaven\u2019t you\nrather a short memory? How about the lion and the lioness?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, that!\u201d he ejaculated with the contempt of a thorough-bred\nsportsman for game already killed. \u201cBut the fact is, that finding them\nhere would lead one to suppose that we can\u2019t be far from a more fertile\ncountry.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt don\u2019t prove much, Dick, for those animals, when goaded by\nhunger or thirst, will travel long distances, and I think that, to-night, we\nhad better keep a more vigilant lookout, and light fires, besides.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat, in such heat as this?\u201d said Joe. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s\nnecessary, we\u2019ll have to do it, but I do think it a real pity to burn\nthis pretty grove that has been such a comfort to us!\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! above all things, we must take the utmost care not to set it on\nfire,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cso that others in the same strait as\nourselves may some day find shelter here in the middle of the desert.\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be very careful, indeed, doctor; but do you think that this\noasis is known?\u201d\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly; it is a halting-place for the caravans that frequent the\ncentre of Africa, and a visit from one of them might be any thing but pleasant\nto you, Joe.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, are there any more of those rascally Nyam-Nyams around here?\u201d\n \n\u201cCertainly; that is the general name of all the neighboring tribes, and,\nunder the same climates, the same races are likely to have similar manners and\ncustoms.\u201d\n \n\u201cPah!\u201d said Joe, \u201cbut, after all, it\u2019s natural enough.\nIf savages had the ways of gentlemen, where would be the difference? By George,\nthese fine fellows wouldn\u2019t have to be coaxed long to eat the\nScotchman\u2019s raw steak, nor the Scotchman either, into the bargain!\u201d\n \nWith this very sensible observation, Joe began to get ready his firewood for\nthe night, making just as little of it as possible. Fortunately, these\nprecautions were superfluous; and each of the party, in his turn, dropped off\ninto the soundest slumber.\n \nOn the next day the weather still showed no sign of change, but kept\nprovokingly and obstinately fair. The balloon remained motionless, without any\noscillation to betray a breath of wind.\n \nThe doctor began to get uneasy again. If their stay in the desert were to be\nprolonged like this, their provisions would give out. After nearly perishing\nfor want of water, they would, at last, have to starve to death!\n \nBut he took fresh courage as he saw the mercury fall considerably in the\nbarometer, and noticed evident signs of an early change in the atmosphere. He\ntherefore resolved to make all his preparations for a start, so as to avail\nhimself of the first opportunity. The feeding-tank and the water-tank were both\ncompletely filled.\n \nThen he had to reestablish the equilibrium of the balloon, and Joe was obliged\nto part with another considerable portion of his precious quartz. With restored\nhealth, his ambitious notions had come back to him, and he made more than one\nwry face before obeying his master; but the latter convinced him that he could\nnot carry so considerable a weight with him through the air, and gave him his\nchoice between the water and the gold. Joe hesitated no longer, but flung out\nthe requisite quantity of his much-prized ore upon the sand.\n \n\u201cThe next people who come this way,\u201d he remarked, \u201cwill be\nrather surprised to find a fortune in such a place.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens,\neh?\u201d suggested Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYou may be certain, Dick, that they would take him by surprise, and that\nhe would publish his astonishment in several folios; so that some day we shall\nhear of a wonderful deposit of gold-bearing quartz in the midst of the African\nsands!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd Joe there, will be the cause of it all!\u201d\n \nThis idea of mystifying some learned sage tickled Joe hugely, and made him\nlaugh.\n \nDuring the rest of the day the doctor vainly kept on the watch for a change of\nweather. The temperature rose, and, had it not been for the shade of the oasis,\nwould have been insupportable. The thermometer marked a hundred and forty-nine\ndegrees in the sun, and a veritable rain of fire filled the air. This was the\nmost intense heat that they had yet noted.\n \nJoe arranged their bivouac for that evening, as he had done for the previous\nnight; and during the watches kept by the doctor and Kennedy there was no fresh\nincident.\n \nBut, toward three o\u2019clock in the morning, while Joe was on guard, the\ntemperature suddenly fell; the sky became overcast with clouds, and the\ndarkness increased.\n \n\u201cTurn out!\u201d cried Joe, arousing his companions. \u201cTurn out!\nHere\u2019s the wind!\u201d\n \n\u201cAt last!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, eying the heavens. \u201cBut it\nis a storm! The balloon! Let us hasten to the balloon!\u201d\n \nIt was high time for them to reach it. The Victoria was bending to the\nforce of the hurricane, and dragging along the car, the latter grazing the\nsand. Had any portion of the ballast been accidentally thrown out, the balloon\nwould have been swept away, and all hope of recovering it have been forever\nlost.\n \nBut fleet-footed Joe put forth his utmost speed, and checked the car, while the\nballoon beat upon the sand, at the risk of being torn to pieces. The doctor,\nfollowed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his cylinder, while his companions\nthrew out the superfluous ballast.\n \nThe travellers took one last look at the trees of the oasis bowing to the force\nof the hurricane, and soon, catching the wind at two hundred feet above the\nground, disappeared in the gloom.\n",

Their\nprofile, muffled by the heavy mist, was defined but vaguely. The monotony,\nhowever, was beginning to disappear.\n \nThe doctor hailed with joy the new country thus disclosed, and, like a seaman\non lookout at the mast-head, he was ready to shout aloud:\n \n\u201cLand, ho! land!\u201d\n \nAn hour later the continent spread broadly before their gaze, still wild in\naspect, but less flat, less denuded, and with a few trees standing out against\nthe gray sky.\n \n\u201cWe are in a civilized country at last!\u201d said the hunter.\n \n\u201cCivilized?

He\nhas his travellers drawn along in a balloon by a team of camels; then a lion\ncomes up, devours the camels, swallows the tow-rope, and hauls the balloon in\ntheir stead; and so on through the story. You see that the whole thing is the\ntop-flower of fancy, but has nothing in common with our style of\nlocomotion.\u201d\n \nJoe, a little cut down at learning that his idea had been used already,\ncudgelled his wits to imagine what animal could have devoured the lion; but he\ncould not guess it, and so quietly went on scanning the appearance of the\ncountry.\n \nA lake of medium extent stretched away before him, surrounded by an\namphitheatre of hills, which yet could not be dignified with the name of\nmountains. There were winding valleys, numerous and fertile, with their tangled\nthickets of the most various trees. The African oil-tree rose above the mass,\nwith leaves fifteen feet in length upon its stalk, the latter studded with\nsharp thorns; the bombax, or silk-cotton-tree, filled the wind, as it swept by,\nwith the fine down of its seeds; the pungent odors of the pendanus, the\n\u201ckenda\u201d of the Arabs, perfumed the air up to the height where the\nVictoria was sailing; the papaw-tree, with its palm-shaped leaves; the\nsterculier, which produces the Soudan-nut; the baobab, and the\nbanana-tree, completed the luxuriant flora of these inter-tropical regions.\n \n\u201cThe country is superb!\u201d said the doctor.\n \n\u201cHere are some animals,\u201d added Joe. \u201cMen are not far\naway.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, what magnificent elephants!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy. \u201cIs\nthere no way to get a little shooting?\u201d\n \n\u201cHow could we manage to halt in a current as strong as this? No, Dick;\nyou must taste a little of the torture of Tantalus just now. You shall make up\nfor it afterward.\u201d\n \nAnd, in truth, there was enough to excite the fancy of a sportsman.\nDick\u2019s heart fairly leaped in his breast as he grasped the butt of his\nPurdy.\n \nThe fauna of the region were as striking as its flora. The wild-ox\nrevelled in dense herbage that often concealed his whole body; gray, black, and\nyellow elephants of the most gigantic size burst headlong, like a living\nhurricane, through the forests, breaking, rending, tearing down, devastating\nevery thing in their path; upon the woody slopes of the hills trickled cascades\nand springs flowing northward; there, too, the hippopotami bathed their huge\nforms, splashing and snorting as they frolicked in the water, and lamantines,\ntwelve feet long, with bodies like seals, stretched themselves along the banks,\nturning up toward the sun their rounded teats swollen with milk.\n \nIt was a whole menagerie of rare and curious beasts in a wondrous hot-house,\nwhere numberless birds with plumage of a thousand hues gleamed and fluttered in\nthe sunshine.\n \nBy this prodigality of Nature, the doctor recognized the splendid kingdom of\nAdamova.\n \n\u201cWe are now beginning to trench upon the realm of modern discovery. I\nhave taken up the lost scent of preceding travellers. It is a happy chance, my\nfriends, for we shall be enabled to link the toils of Captains Burton and Speke\nwith the explorations of Dr. Barth. We have left the Englishmen behind us, and\nnow have caught up with the Hamburger. It will not be long, either, before we\narrive at the extreme point attained by that daring explorer.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt seems to me that there is a vast extent of country between the two\nexplored routes,\u201d remarked Kennedy; \u201cat least, if I am to judge by\nthe distance that we have made.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is easy to determine: take the map and see what is the longitude of\nthe southern point of Lake Uk\u00e9r\u00e9ou\u00e9, reached by Speke.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is near the thirty-seventh degree.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the city of Yola, which we shall sight this evening, and to which\nBarth penetrated, what is its position?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is about in the twelfth degree of east longitude.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen there are twenty-five degrees, or, counting sixty miles to each,\nabout fifteen hundred miles in all.\u201d\n \n\u201cA nice little walk,\u201d said Joe, \u201cfor people who have to go on\nfoot.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt will be accomplished, however. Livingstone and Moffat are pushing on\nup this line toward the interior. Nyassa, which they have discovered, is not\nfar from Lake Tanganayika, seen by Burton. Ere the close of the century these\nregions will, undoubtedly, be explored. But,\u201d added the doctor,\nconsulting his compass, \u201cI regret that the wind is carrying us so far to\nthe westward. I wanted to get to the north.\u201d\n \nAfter twelve hours of progress, the Victoria found herself on the confines of\nNigritia. The first inhabitants of this region, the Chouas Arabs, were feeding\ntheir wandering flocks. The immense summits of the Atlantika Mountains seen\nabove the horizon\u2014mountains that no European foot had yet scaled, and\nwhose height is computed to be ten thousand feet! Their western slope\ndetermines the flow of all the waters in this region of Africa toward the\nocean. They are the Mountains of the Moon to this part of the continent.\n \nAt length a real river greeted the gaze of our travellers, and, by the enormous\nant-hills seen in its vicinity, the doctor recognized the Benou\u00e9, one of the\ngreat tributaries of the Niger, the one which the natives have called\n\u201cThe Fountain of the Waters.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis river,\u201d said the doctor to his companions, \u201cwill, one\nday, be the natural channel of communication with the interior of Nigritia.\nUnder the command of one of our brave captains, the steamer Pleiad has\nalready ascended as far as the town of Yola. You see that we are not in an\nunknown country.\u201d\n \nNumerous slaves were engaged in the labors of the field, cultivating sorgho, a\nkind of millet which forms the chief basis of their diet; and the most stupid\nexpressions of astonishment ensued as the Victoria sped past like a\nmeteor. That evening the balloon halted about forty miles from Yola, and ahead\nof it, but in the distance, rose the two sharp cones of Mount Mendif.\n \nThe doctor threw out his anchors and made fast to the top of a high tree; but a\nvery violent wind beat upon the balloon with such force as to throw it over on\nits side, thus rendering the position of the car sometimes extremely dangerous.\nFerguson did not close his eyes all night, and he was repeatedly on the point\nof cutting the anchor-rope and scudding away before the gale. At length,\nhowever, the storm abated, and the oscillations of the balloon ceased to be\nalarming.\n \nOn the morrow the wind was more moderate, but it carried our travellers away\nfrom the city of Yola, which recently rebuilt by the Fouillans, excited\nFerguson\u2019s curiosity. However, he had to make up his mind to being borne\nfarther to the northward and even a little to the east.\n \nKennedy proposed to halt in this fine hunting-country, and Joe declared that\nthe need of fresh meat was beginning to be felt; but the savage customs of the\ncountry, the attitude of the population, and some shots fired at the\nVictoria, admonished the doctor to continue his journey. They were then\ncrossing a region that was the scene of massacres and burnings, and where\nwarlike conflicts between the barbarian sultans, contending for their power\namid the most atrocious carnage, never cease.\n \nNumerous and populous villages of long low huts stretched away between broad\npasture-fields whose dense herbage was besprinkled with violet-colored\nblossoms. The huts, looking like huge beehives, were sheltered behind bristling\npalisades. The wild hill-sides and hollows frequently reminded the beholder of\nthe glens in the Highlands of Scotland, as Kennedy more than once remarked.\n \nIn spite of all he could do, the doctor bore directly to the northeast, toward\nMount Mendif, which was lost in the midst of environing clouds. The lofty\nsummits of these mountains separate the valley of the Niger from the basin of\nLake Tchad.\n \nSoon afterward was seen the Bag\u00e9l\u00e9, with its eighteen villages clinging to its\nflanks like a whole brood of children to their mother\u2019s bosom\u2014a\nmagnificent spectacle for the beholder whose gaze commanded and took in the\nentire picture at one view. Even the ravines were seen to be covered with\nfields of rice and of arachides.\n \nBy three o\u2019clock the Victoria was directly in front of Mount\nMendif. It had been impossible to avoid it; the only thing to be done was to\ncross it. The doctor, by means of a temperature increased to one hundred and\neighty degrees, gave the balloon a fresh ascensional force of nearly sixteen\nhundred pounds, and it went up to an elevation of more than eight thousand\nfeet, the greatest height attained during the journey. The temperature of the\natmosphere was so much cooler at that point that the a\u00ebronauts had to resort to\ntheir blankets and thick coverings.\n \nFerguson was in haste to descend; the covering of the balloon gave indications\nof bursting, but in the meanwhile he had time to satisfy himself of the\nvolcanic origin of the mountain, whose extinct craters are now but deep\nabysses. Immense accumulations of bird-guano gave the sides of Mount Mendif the\nappearance of calcareous rocks, and there was enough of the deposit there to\nmanure all the lands in the United Kingdom.\n \nAt five o\u2019clock the Victoria, sheltered from the south winds, went\ngently gliding along the slopes of the mountain, and stopped in a wide clearing\nremote from any habitation. The instant it touched the soil, all needful\nprecautions were taken to hold it there firmly; and Kennedy, fowling-piece in\nhand, sallied out upon the sloping plain. Ere long, he returned with half a\ndozen wild ducks and a kind of snipe, which Joe served up in his best style.\nThe meal was heartily relished, and the night was passed in undisturbed and\nrefreshing slumber.\n",

It might almost have been said that Ferguson managed it with a wave\nof the hand; and hence, without knowing in advance, where the point of arrival\nwould be, the doctor had no fears concerning the successful issue of his\njourney. However, in this country of barbarians and fanatics, prudence obliged\nhim to take the strictest precautions. He therefore counselled his companions\nto have their eyes wide open for every thing and at all hours.\n \nThe wind drifted a little more to the northward, and, toward nine\no\u2019clock, they sighted the larger city of Mosfeia, built upon an eminence\nwhich was itself enclosed between two lofty mountains. Its position was\nimpregnable, a narrow road running between a marsh and a thick wood being the\nonly channel of approach to it.\n \nAt the moment of which we write, a sheik, accompanied by a mounted escort, and\nclad in a garb of brilliant colors, preceded by couriers and trumpeters, who\nput aside the boughs of the trees as he rode up, was making his grand entry\ninto the place.\n \nThe doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this cavalcade\nof natives; but, as the balloon grew larger to their eyes, they began to show\nsymptoms of intense affright, and at length made off in different directions as\nfast as their legs and those of their horses could carry them.\n \nThe sheik alone did not budge an inch. He merely grasped his long musket,\ncocked it, and proudly waited in silence. The doctor came on to within a\nhundred and fifty feet of him, and then, with his roundest and fullest voice,\nsaluted him courteously in the Arabic tongue.\n \nBut, upon hearing these words falling, as it seemed, from the sky, the sheik\ndismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway, where the doctor\nhad to leave him, finding it impossible to divert him from his adoration.\n \n\u201cUnquestionably,\u201d Ferguson remarked, \u201cthose people take us\nfor supernatural beings. When Europeans came among them for the first time,\nthey were mistaken for creatures of a higher race. When this sheik comes to\nspeak of to-day\u2019s meeting, he will not fail to embellish the circumstance\nwith all the resources of an Arab imagination. You may, therefore, judge what\nan account their legends will give of us some day.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot such a desirable thing, after all,\u201d said the Scot, \u201cin\nthe point of view that affects civilization; it would be better to pass for\nmere men. That would give these negro races a superior idea of European\npower.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery good, my dear Dick; but what can we do about it? You might sit all\nday explaining the mechanism of a balloon to the savants of this\ncountry, and yet they would not comprehend you, but would persist in ascribing\nit to supernatural aid.\u201d\n \n\u201cDoctor, you spoke of the first time Europeans visited these regions. Who\nwere the visitors?\u201d inquired Joe.\n \n\u201cMy dear fellow, we are now upon the very track of Major Denham. It was\nat this very city of Mosfeia that he was received by the Sultan of Mandara; he\nhad quitted the Bornou country; he accompanied the sheik in an expedition\nagainst the Fellatahs; he assisted in the attack on the city, which, with its\narrows alone, bravely resisted the bullets of the Arabs, and put the\nsheik\u2019s troops to flight. All this was but a pretext for murders, raids,\nand pillage. The major was completely plundered and stripped, and had it not\nbeen for his horse, under whose stomach he clung with the skill of an Indian\nrider, and was borne with a headlong gallop from his barbarous pursuers, he\nnever could have made his way back to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho was this Major Denham?\u201d\n \n\u201cA fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an\nexpedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton and Dr.\nOudney. They set out from Tripoli in the month of March, reached Mourzouk, the\ncapital of Fez, and, following the route which at a later period Dr. Barth was\nto pursue on his way back to Europe, they arrived, on the 16th of February,\n1823, at Kouka, near Lake Tchad. Denham made several explorations in Bornou, in\nMandara, and to the eastern shores of the lake. In the mean time, on the 15th\nof December, 1823, Captain Clapperton and Dr. Oudney had pushed their way\nthrough the Soudan country as far as Sackatoo, and Oudney died of fatigue and\nexhaustion in the town of Murmur.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis part of Africa has, therefore, paid a heavy tribute of victims to\nthe cause of science,\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes, this country is fatal to travellers. We are moving directly toward\nthe kingdom of Baghirmi, which Vogel traversed in 1856, so as to reach the\nWadai country, where he disappeared. This young man, at the age of\ntwenty-three, had been sent to cooperate with Dr. Barth. They met on the 1st of\nDecember, 1854, and thereupon commenced his explorations of the country. Toward\n1856, he announced, in the last letters received from him, his intention to\nreconnoitre the kingdom of Wadai, which no European had yet penetrated. It\nappears that he got as far as Wara, the capital, where, according to some\naccounts, he was made prisoner, and, according to others, was put to death for\nhaving attempted to ascend a sacred mountain in the environs. But, we must not\ntoo lightly admit the death of travellers, since that does away with the\nnecessity of going in search of them. For instance, how often was the death of\nDr. Barth reported, to his own great annoyance! It is, therefore, very possible\nthat Vogel may still be held as a prisoner by the Sultan of Wadai, in the hope\nof obtaining a good ransom for him.\n \n\u201cBaron de Neimans was about starting for the Wadai country when he died\nat Cairo, in 1855; and we now know that De Heuglin has set out on Vogel\u2019s\ntrack with the expedition sent from Leipsic, so that we shall soon be\naccurately informed as to the fate of that young and interesting\nexplorer.\u201d[4]\n \n [4]\nSince the doctor\u2019s departure, letters written from El\u2019Obeid by Mr.\nMuntzinger, the newly-appointed head of the expedition, unfortunately place the\ndeath of Vogel beyond a doubt.\n \nMosfeia had disappeared from the horizon long ere this, and the Mandara country\nwas developing to the gaze of our a\u00ebronauts its astonishing fertility, with its\nforests of acacias, its locust-trees covered with red flowers, and the\nherbaceous plants of its fields of cotton and indigo trees. The river Shari,\nwhich eighty miles farther on rolled its impetuous waters into Lake Tchad, was\nquite distinctly seen.\n \nThe doctor got his companions to trace its course upon the maps drawn by Dr.\nBarth.\n \n\u201cYou perceive,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the labors of this\nsavant have been conducted with great precision; we are moving directly\ntoward the Loggoum region, and perhaps toward Kernak, its capital. It was there\nthat poor Toole died, at the age of scarcely twenty-two. He was a young\nEnglishman, an ensign in the 80th regiment, who, a few weeks before, had joined\nMajor Denham in Africa, and it was not long ere he there met his death. Ah!\nthis vast country might well be called the graveyard of European\ntravellers.\u201d\n \nSome boats, fifty feet long, were descending the current of the Shari. The\nVictoria, then one thousand feet above the soil, hardly attracted the\nattention of the natives; but the wind, which until then had been blowing with\na certain degree of strength, was falling off.\n \n\u201cIs it possible that we are to be caught in another dead calm?\u201d\nsighed the doctor.\n \n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve no lack of water, nor the desert to fear, anyhow,\nmaster,\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cNo; but there are races here still more to be dreaded.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy!\u201d said Joe, again, \u201cthere\u2019s something like a\ntown.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is Kernak. The last puffs of the breeze are wafting us to it, and,\nif we choose, we can take an exact plan of the place.\u201d\n \n\u201cShall we not go nearer to it?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNothing easier, Dick! We are right over it. Allow me to turn the\nstopcock of the cylinder, and we\u2019ll not be long in descending.\u201d\n \nHalf an hour later the balloon hung motionless about two hundred feet from the\nground.\n \n\u201cHere we are!\u201d said the doctor, \u201cnearer to Kernak than a man\nwould be to London, if he were perched in the cupola of St. Paul\u2019s. So we\ncan take a survey at our ease.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is that tick-tacking sound that we hear on all sides?\u201d\n \nJoe looked attentively, and at length discovered that the noise they heard was\nproduced by a number of weavers beating cloth stretched in the open air, on\nlarge trunks of trees.\n \nThe capital of Loggoum could then be seen in its entire extent, like an\nunrolled chart. It is really a city with straight rows of houses and quite wide\nstreets. In the midst of a large open space there was a slave-market, attended\nby a great crowd of customers, for the Mandara women, who have extremely small\nhands and feet, are in excellent request, and can be sold at lucrative rates.\n \nAt the sight of the Victoria, the scene so often produced occurred\nagain. At first there were outcries, and then followed general stupefaction;\nbusiness was abandoned; work was flung aside, and all noise ceased. The\na\u00ebronauts remained as they were, completely motionless, and lost not a detail\nof the populous city. They even went down to within sixty feet of the ground.\n \nHereupon the Governor of Loggoum came out from his residence, displaying his\ngreen standard, and accompanied by his musicians, who blew on hoarse\nbuffalo-horns, as though they would split their cheeks or any thing else,\nexcepting their own lungs. The crowd at once gathered around him. In the mean\nwhile Dr. Ferguson tried to make himself heard, but in vain.\n \nThis population looked like proud and intelligent people, with their high\nforeheads, their almost aquiline noses, and their curling hair; but the\npresence of the Victoria troubled them greatly. Horsemen could be seen\ngalloping in all directions, and it soon became evident that the\ngovernor\u2019s troops were assembling to oppose so extraordinary a foe. Joe\nwore himself out waving handkerchiefs of every color and shape to them; but his\nexertions were all to no purpose.\n \nHowever, the sheik, surrounded by his court, proclaimed silence, and pronounced\na discourse, of which the doctor could not understand a word. It was Arabic,\nmixed with Baghirmi. He could make out enough, however, by the universal\nlanguage of gestures, to be aware that he was receiving a very polite\ninvitation to depart. Indeed, he would have asked for nothing better, but for\nlack of wind, the thing had become impossible. His noncompliance, therefore,\nexasperated the governor, whose courtiers and attendants set up a furious howl\nto enforce immediate obedience on the part of the a\u00ebrial monster.\n \nThey were odd-looking fellows those courtiers, with their five or six shirts\nswathed around their bodies! They had enormous stomachs, some of which actually\nseemed to be artificial. The doctor surprised his companions by informing them\nthat this was the way to pay court to the sultan. The rotundity of the stomach\nindicated the ambition of its possessor. These corpulent gentry gesticulated\nand bawled at the top of their voices\u2014one of them particularly\ndistinguishing himself above the rest\u2014to such an extent, indeed, that he\nmust have been a prime minister\u2014at least, if the disturbance he made was\nany criterion of his rank. The common rabble of dusky denizens united their\nhowlings with the uproar of the court, repeating their gesticulations like so\nmany monkeys, and thereby producing a single and instantaneous movement of ten\nthousand arms at one time.\n \nTo these means of intimidation, which were presently deemed insufficient, were\nadded others still more formidable. Soldiers, armed with bows and arrows, were\ndrawn up in line of battle; but by this time the balloon was expanding, and\nrising quietly beyond their reach. Upon this the governor seized a musket and\naimed it at the balloon; but, Kennedy, who was watching him, shattered the\nuplifted weapon in the sheik\u2019s grasp.\n \nAt this unexpected blow there was a general rout. Every mother\u2019s son of\nthem scampered for his dwelling with the utmost celerity, and stayed there, so\nthat the streets of the town were absolutely deserted for the remainder of that\nday.\n \nNight came, and not a breath of wind was stirring. The a\u00ebronauts had to make up\ntheir minds to remain motionless at the distance of but three hundred feet\nabove the ground. Not a fire or light shone in the deep gloom, and around\nreigned the silence of death; but the doctor only redoubled his vigilance, as\nthis apparent quiet might conceal some snare.\n \nAnd he had reason to be watchful. About midnight, the whole city seemed to be\nin a blaze. Hundreds of streaks of flame crossed each other, and shot to and\nfro in the air like rockets, forming a regular network of fire.\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s really curious!\u201d said the doctor, somewhat puzzled to\nmake out what it meant.\n \n\u201cBy all that\u2019s glorious!\u201d shouted Kennedy, \u201cit looks as\nif the fire were ascending and coming up toward us!\u201d\n \nAnd, sure enough, with an accompaniment of musket-shots, yelling, and din of\nevery description, the mass of fire was, indeed, mounting toward the\nVictoria. Joe got ready to throw out ballast, and Ferguson was not long\nat guessing the truth. Thousands of pigeons, their tails garnished with\ncombustibles, had been set loose and driven toward the Victoria; and\nnow, in their terror, they were flying high up, zigzagging the atmosphere with\nlines of fire. Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the\nmiddle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a\nnumberless army? The pigeons were already whisking around the car; they were\neven surrounding the balloon, the sides of which, reflecting their\nillumination, looked as though enveloped with a network of fire.\n \nThe doctor dared hesitate no longer; and, throwing out a fragment of quartz, he\nkept himself beyond the reach of these dangerous assailants; and, for two hours\nafterward, he could see them wandering hither and thither through the darkness\nof the night, until, little by little, their light diminished, and they, one by\none, died out.\n \n\u201cNow we may sleep in quiet,\u201d said the doctor.\n \n\u201cNot badly got up for barbarians,\u201d mused friend Joe, speaking his\nthoughts aloud.\n \n\u201cOh, they employ these pigeons frequently, to set fire to the thatch of\nhostile villages; but this time the village mounted higher than they could\ngo.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, positively, a balloon need fear no enemies!\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, indeed, it may!\u201d objected Ferguson.\n \n\u201cWhat are they, then, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are the careless people in the car! So, my friends, let us have\nvigilance in all places and at all times.\u201d\n",

The Victoria was once\nagain in motion, and both the doctor and Kennedy awoke.\n \nThe former consulted his compass, and saw, with satisfaction, that the wind was\ncarrying them toward the north-northeast.\n \n\u201cWe are in luck!\u201d said he; \u201cevery thing works in our favor:\nwe shall discover Lake Tchad this very day.\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it a broad sheet of water?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cSomewhat, Dick. At its greatest length and breadth, it measures about\none hundred and twenty miles.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt will spice our trip with a little variety to sail over a spacious\nsheet of water.\u201d\n \n\u201cAfter all, though, I don\u2019t see that we have much to complain of on\nthat score. Our trip has been very much varied, indeed; and, moreover, we are\ngetting on under the best possible conditions.\u201d\n \n\u201cUnquestionably so; excepting those privations on the desert, we have\nencountered no serious danger.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is not to be denied that our noble balloon has behaved wonderfully\nwell. To-day is May 12th, and we started on the 18th of April. That makes\ntwenty-five days of journeying. In ten days more we shall have reached our\ndestination.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhere is that?\u201d\n \n\u201cI do not know. But what does that signify?\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are right again, Samuel! Let us intrust to Providence the care of\nguiding us and of keeping us in good health as we are now. We don\u2019t look\nmuch as though we had been crossing the most pestilential country in the\nworld!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe had an opportunity of getting up in life, and that\u2019s what we\nhave done!\u201d\n \n\u201cHurrah for trips in the air!\u201d cried Joe. \u201cHere we are at the\nend of twenty-five days in good condition, well fed, and well rested.\nWe\u2019ve had too much rest in fact, for my legs begin to feel rusty, and I\nwouldn\u2019t be vexed a bit to stretch them with a run of thirty miles or\nso!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou can do that, Joe, in the streets of London, but in fine we set out\nthree together, like Denham, Clapperton, and Overweg; like Barth, Richardson,\nand Vogel, and, more fortunate than our predecessors here, we are three in\nnumber still. But it is most important for us not to separate. If, while one of\nus was on the ground, the Victoria should have to ascend in order to\nescape some sudden danger, who knows whether we should ever see each other\nagain? Therefore it is that I say again to Kennedy frankly that I do not like\nhis going off alone to hunt.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut still, Samuel, you will permit me to indulge that fancy a little.\nThere is no harm in renewing our stock of provisions. Besides, before our\ndeparture, you held out to me the prospect of some superb hunting, and thus far\nI have done but little in the line of the Andersons and Cummings.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, my dear Dick, your memory fails you, or your modesty makes you\nforget your own exploits. It really seems to me that, without mentioning small\ngame, you have already an antelope, an elephant, and two lions on your\nconscience.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what\u2019s all that to an African sportsman who sees all the\nanimals in creation strutting along under the muzzle of his rifle? There!\nthere! look at that troop of giraffes!\u201d\n \n\u201cThose giraffes,\u201d roared Joe; \u201cwhy, they\u2019re not as big\nas my fist.\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause we are a thousand feet above them; but close to them you would\ndiscover that they are three times as tall as you are!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what do you say to yon herd of gazelles, and those ostriches, that\nrun with the speed of the wind?\u201d resumed Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThose ostriches?\u201d remonstrated Joe, again; \u201cthose are\nchickens, and the greatest kind of chickens!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, doctor, can\u2019t we get down nearer to them?\u201d pleaded\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cWe can get closer to them, Dick, but we must not land. And what good\nwill it do you to strike down those poor animals when they can be of no use to\nyou? Now, if the question were to destroy a lion, a tiger, a cat, a hyena, I\ncould understand it; but to deprive an antelope or a gazelle of life, to no\nother purpose than the gratification of your instincts as a sportsman, seems\nhardly worth the trouble. But, after all, my friend, we are going to keep at\nabout one hundred feet only from the soil, and, should you see any ferocious\nwild beast, oblige us by sending a ball through its heart!\u201d\n \nThe Victoria descended gradually, but still keeping at a safe height,\nfor, in a barbarous, yet very populous country, it was necessary to keep on the\nwatch for unexpected perils.\n \nThe travellers were then directly following the course of the Shari. The\ncharming banks of this river were hidden beneath the foliage of trees of\nvarious dyes; lianas and climbing plants wound in and out on all sides and\nformed the most curious combinations of color. Crocodiles were seen basking in\nthe broad blaze of the sun or plunging beneath the waters with the agility of\nlizards, and in their gambols they sported about among the many green islands\nthat intercept the current of the stream.\n \nIt was thus, in the midst of rich and verdant landscapes that our travellers\npassed over the district of Maffatay, and about nine o\u2019clock in the\nmorning reached the southern shore of Lake Tchad.\n \nThere it was at last, outstretched before them, that Caspian Sea of Africa, the\nexistence of which was so long consigned to the realms of fable\u2014that\ninterior expanse of water to which only Denham\u2019s and Barth\u2019s\nexpeditions had been able to force their way.\n \nThe doctor strove in vain to fix its precise configuration upon paper. It had\nalready changed greatly since 1847. In fact, the chart of Lake Tchad is very\ndifficult to trace with exactitude, for it is surrounded by muddy and almost\nimpassable morasses, in which Barth thought that he was doomed to perish. From\nyear to year these marshes, covered with reeds and papyrus fifteen feet high,\nbecome the lake itself. Frequently, too, the villages on its shores are half\nsubmerged, as was the case with Ngornou in 1856, and now the hippopotamus and\nthe alligator frisk and dive where the dwellings of Bornou once stood.\n \nThe sun shot his dazzling rays over this placid sheet of water, and toward the\nnorth the two elements merged into one and the same horizon.\n \nThe doctor was desirous of determining the character of the water, which was\nlong believed to be salt. There was no danger in descending close to the lake,\nand the car was soon skimming its surface like a bird at the distance of only\nfive feet.\n \nJoe plunged a bottle into the lake and drew it up half filled. The water was\nthen tasted and found to be but little fit for drinking, with a certain\ncarbonate-of-soda flavor.\n \nWhile the doctor was jotting down the result of this experiment, the loud\nreport of a gun was heard close beside him. Kennedy had not been able to resist\nthe temptation of firing at a huge hippopotamus. The latter, who had been\nbasking quietly, disappeared at the sound of the explosion, but did not seem to\nbe otherwise incommoded by Kennedy\u2019s conical bullet.\n \n\u201cYou\u2019d have done better if you had harpooned him,\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n \n\u201cWith one of our anchors. It would have been a hook just big enough for\nsuch a rousing beast as that!\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph!\u201d ejaculated Kennedy, \u201cJoe really has an idea this\ntime\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWhich I beg of you not to put into execution,\u201d interposed the\ndoctor. \u201cThe animal would very quickly have dragged us where we could not\nhave done much to help ourselves, and where we have no business to be.\u201d\n \n\u201cEspecially now since we\u2019ve settled the question as to what kind of\nwater there is in Lake Tchad. Is that sort of fish good to eat, Dr.\nFerguson?\u201d\n \n\u201cThat fish, as you call it, Joe, is really a mammiferous animal of the\npachydermal species. Its flesh is said to be excellent and is an article of\nimportant trade between the tribes living along the borders of the lake.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s shot didn\u2019t do more\ndamage.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe animal is vulnerable only in the stomach and between the thighs.\nDick\u2019s ball hasn\u2019t even marked him; but should the ground strike me\nas favorable, we shall halt at the northern end of the lake, where Kennedy will\nfind himself in the midst of a whole menagerie, and can make up for lost\ntime.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell,\u201d said Joe, \u201cI hope then that Mr. Kennedy will hunt the\nhippopotamus a little; I\u2019d like to taste the meat of that queer-looking\nbeast. It doesn\u2019t look exactly natural to get away into the centre of\nAfrica, to feed on snipe and partridge, just as if we were in England.\u201d\n",
        "\n\nThe Capital of Bornou.\u2014The Islands of the Biddiomahs.\u2014The\nCondors.\u2014The Doctor\u2019s Anxieties.\u2014His Precautions.\u2014An\nAttack in Mid-air.\u2014The Balloon Covering torn.\u2014The\nFall.\u2014Sublime Self-Sacrifice.\u2014The Northern Coast of the Lake.\n \nSince its arrival at Lake Tchad, the balloon had struck a current that edged it\nfarther to the westward. A few clouds tempered the heat of the day, and,\nbesides, a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of water; but about\none o\u2019clock, the Victoria, having slanted across this part of the\nlake, again advanced over the land for a space of seven or eight miles.\n \nThe doctor, who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course, no\nlonger thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of Kouka, the\ncapital of Bornou. He saw it for a moment, encircled by its walls of white\nclay, and a few rudely-constructed mosques rising clumsily above that\nconglomeration of houses that look like playing-dice, which form most Arab\ntowns. In the court-yards of the private dwellings, and on the public squares,\ngrew palms and caoutchouc-trees topped with a dome of foliage more than one\nhundred feet in breadth. Joe called attention to the fact that these immense\nparasols were in proper accordance with the intense heat of the sun, and made\nthereon some pious reflections which it were needless to repeat.\n \nKouka really consists of two distinct towns, separated by the\n\u201cDendal,\u201d a large boulevard three hundred yards wide, at that hour\ncrowded with horsemen and foot passengers. On one side, the rich quarter stands\nsquarely with its airy and lofty houses, laid out in regular order; on the\nother, is huddled together the poor quarter, a miserable collection of low\nhovels of a conical shape, in which a poverty-stricken multitude vegetate\nrather than live, since Kouka is neither a trading nor a commercial city.\n \nKennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh, were that city extended on\na plain, with its two distinct boroughs.\n \nBut our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of it, for,\nwith the fickleness that characterizes the air-currents of this region, a\ncontrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the surface of Lake\nTchad.\n \nThen then were regaled with a new spectacle. They could count the numerous\nislets of the lake, inhabited by the Biddiomahs, a race of bloodthirsty and\nformidable pirates, who are as greatly feared when neighbors as are the\nTouaregs of Sahara.\n \nThese estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely\nwith stones and arrows, but the balloon quickly passed their islands,\nfluttering over them, from one to the other with butterfly motion, like a\ngigantic beetle.\n \nAt this moment, Joe, who was scanning the horizon, said to Kennedy:\n \n\u201cThere, sir, as you are always thinking of good sport, yonder is just the\nthing for you!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is it, Joe?\u201d\n \n\u201cThis time, the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t you see that flock of big birds making for us?\u201d\n \n\u201cBirds?\u201d exclaimed the doctor, snatching his spy-glass.\n \n\u201cI see them,\u201d replied Kennedy; \u201cthere are at least a dozen of\nthem.\u201d\n \n\u201cFourteen, exactly!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cHeaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the\ndoctor to let me peg away at them!\u201d\n \n\u201cI should not object, but I would much rather see those birds at a\ndistance from us!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, are you afraid of those fowls?\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are condors, and of the largest size. Should they attack\nus\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, if they do, we\u2019ll defend ourselves. We have a whole arsenal\nat our disposal. I don\u2019t think those birds are so very formidable.\u201d\n \n\u201cWho can tell?\u201d was the doctor\u2019s only remark.\n \nTen minutes later, the flock had come within gunshot, and were making the air\nring with their hoarse cries. They came right toward the Victoria, more\nirritated than frightened by her presence.\n \n\u201cHow they scream! What a noise!\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cPerhaps they don\u2019t like to see anybody poaching in their country\nup in the air, or daring to fly like themselves!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, now, to tell the truth, when I take a good look at them, they are\nan ugly, ferocious set, and I should think them dangerous enough if they were\narmed with Purdy-Moore rifles,\u201d admitted Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThey have no need of such weapons,\u201d said Ferguson, looking very\ngrave.\n \nThe condors flew around them in wide circles, their flight growing gradually\ncloser and closer to the balloon. They swept through the air in rapid,\nfantastic curves, occasionally precipitating themselves headlong with the speed\nof a bullet, and then breaking their line of projection by an abrupt and daring\nangle.\n \nThe doctor, much disquieted, resolved to ascend so as to escape this dangerous\nproximity. He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon, and it rapidly\nrose.\n \nBut the condors mounted with him, apparently determined not to part company.\n \n\u201cThey seem to mean mischief!\u201d said the hunter, cocking his rifle.\n \nAnd, in fact, they were swooping nearer, and more than one came within fifty\nfeet of them, as if defying the fire-arms.\n \n\u201cBy George, I\u2019m itching to let them have it!\u201d exclaimed\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cNo, Dick; not now! Don\u2019t exasperate them needlessly. That would\nonly be exciting them to attack us!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I could soon settle those fellows!\u201d\n \n\u201cYou may think so, Dick. But you are wrong!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy, we have a bullet for each of them!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what\nwould you do? How would you get at them? Just imagine yourself in the presence\nof a troop of lions on the plain, or a school of sharks in the open ocean! For\ntravellers in the air, this situation is just as dangerous.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you speaking seriously, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cVery seriously, Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us wait, then!\u201d\n \n\u201cWait! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack, but do not fire\nwithout my orders.\u201d\n \nThe birds then collected at a short distance, yet so near that their naked\nnecks, entirely bare of feathers, could be plainly seen, as they stretched them\nout with the effort of their cries, while their gristly crests, garnished with\na comb and gills of deep violet, stood erect with rage. They were of the very\nlargest size, their bodies being more than three feet in length, and the lower\nsurface of their white wings glittering in the sunlight. They might well have\nbeen considered winged sharks, so striking was their resemblance to those\nferocious rangers of the deep.\n \n\u201cThey are following us!\u201d said the doctor, as he saw them ascending\nwith him, \u201cand, mount as we may, they can fly still higher!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, what are we to do?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \nThe doctor made no answer.\n \n\u201cListen, Samuel!\u201d said the sportsman. \u201cThere are fourteen of\nthose birds; we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our\nweapons. Have we not the means, then, to destroy them or disperse them? I will\ngive a good account of some of them!\u201d\n \n\u201cI have no doubt of your skill, Dick; I look upon all as dead that may\ncome within range of your rifle, but I repeat that, if they attack the upper\npart of the balloon, you could not get a sight at them. They would tear the\nsilk covering that sustains us, and we are three thousand feet up in the\nair!\u201d\n \nAt this moment, one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon, with\noutstretched beak and claws, ready to rend it with either or both.\n \n\u201cFire! fire at once!\u201d cried the doctor.\n \nHe had scarcely ceased, ere the huge creature, stricken dead, dropped headlong,\nturning over and over in space as he fell.\n \nKennedy had already grasped one of the two-barrelled fowling-pieces and Joe was\ntaking aim with another.\n \nFrightened by the report, the condors drew back for a moment, but they almost\ninstantly returned to the charge with extreme fury. Kennedy severed the head of\none from its body with his first shot, and Joe broke the wing of another.\n \n\u201cOnly eleven left,\u201d said he.\n \nThereupon the birds changed their tactics, and by common consent soared above\nthe balloon. Kennedy glanced at Ferguson. The latter, in spite of his\nimperturbability, grew pale. Then ensued a moment of terrifying silence. In the\nnext they heard a harsh tearing noise, as of something rending the silk, and\nthe car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of our three a\u00ebronauts.\n \n\u201cWe are lost!\u201d exclaimed Ferguson, glancing at the barometer, which\nwas now swiftly rising.\n \n\u201cOver with the ballast!\u201d he shouted, \u201cover with it!\u201d\n \nAnd in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared.\n \n\u201cWe are still falling! Empty the water-tanks! Do you hear me, Joe? We are\npitching into the lake!\u201d\n \nJoe obeyed. The doctor leaned over and looked out. The lake seemed to come up\ntoward him like a rising tide. Every object around grew rapidly in size while\nthey were looking at it. The car was not two hundred feet from the surface of\nLake Tchad.\n \n\u201cThe provisions! the provisions!\u201d cried the doctor.\n \nAnd the box containing them was launched into space.\n \nTheir descent became less rapid, but the luckless a\u00ebronauts were still falling,\nand into the lake.\n \n\u201cThrow out something\u2014something more!\u201d cried the doctor.\n \n\u201cThere is nothing more to throw!\u201d was Kennedy\u2019s despairing\nresponse.\n \n\u201cYes, there is!\u201d called Joe, and with a wave of the hand he\ndisappeared like a flash, over the edge of the car.\n \n\u201cJoe! Joe!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, horror-stricken.\n \nThe Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion, mounted a\nthousand feet into the air, and the wind, burying itself in the disinflated\ncovering, bore them away toward the northern part of the lake.\n \n\u201cLost!\u201d exclaimed the sportsman, with a gesture of despair.\n \n\u201cLost to save us!\u201d responded Ferguson.\n \nAnd these men, intrepid as they were, felt the large tears streaming down their\ncheeks. They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some trace of their\nheroic companion, but they were already far away from him.\n \n\u201cWhat course shall we pursue?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAlight as soon as possible, Dick, and then wait.\u201d\n \nAfter a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore,\non the north of the lake. The anchors caught in a low tree and the sportsman\nfastened it securely. Night came, but neither Ferguson nor Kennedy could find\none moment\u2019s sleep.\n",
        "\n\nConjectures.\u2014Reestablishment of the Victoria\u2019s\nEquilibrium.\u2014Dr. Ferguson\u2019s New Calculations.\u2014Kennedy\u2019s\nHunt.\u2014A Complete Exploration of Lake Tchad.\u2014Tangalia.\u2014The\nReturn.\u2014Lari.\n \nOn the morrow, the 13th of May, our travellers, for the first time,\nreconnoitred the part of the coast on which they had landed. It was a sort of\nisland of solid ground in the midst of an immense marsh. Around this fragment\nof terra firma grew reeds as lofty as trees are in Europe, and\nstretching away out of sight.\n \nThese impenetrable swamps gave security to the position of the balloon. It was\nnecessary to watch only the borders of the lake. The vast stretch of water\nbroadened away from the spot, especially toward the east, and nothing could be\nseen on the horizon, neither mainland nor islands.\n \nThe two friends had not yet ventured to speak of their recent companion.\nKennedy first imparted his conjectures to the doctor.\n \n\u201cPerhaps Joe is not lost after all,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a\nskilful lad, and had few equals as a swimmer. He would find no difficulty in\nswimming across the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh. We shall see him\nagain\u2014but how and where I know not. Let us omit nothing on our part to\ngive him the chance of rejoining us.\u201d\n \n\u201cMay God grant it as you say, Dick!\u201d replied the doctor, with much\nemotion. \u201cWe shall do everything in the world to find our lost friend\nagain. Let us, in the first place, see where we are. But, above all things, let\nus rid the Victoria of this outside covering, which is of no further\nuse. That will relieve us of six hundred and fifty pounds, a weight not to be\ndespised\u2014and the end is worth the trouble!\u201d\n \nThe doctor and Kennedy went to work at once, but they encountered great\ndifficulty. They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece, and then cut\nit in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of the network. The\ntear made by the beaks of the condors was found to be several feet in length.\n \nThis operation took at least four hours, but at length the inner balloon once\ncompletely extricated did not appear to have suffered in the least degree. The\nVictoria was thus diminished in size by one fifth, and this difference\nwas sufficiently noticeable to excite Kennedy\u2019s surprise.\n \n\u201cWill it be large enough?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cHave no fears on that score, I will reestablish the equilibrium, and\nshould our poor Joe return we shall find a way to start off with him again on\nour old route.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt the moment of our fall, unless I am mistaken, we were not far from an\nisland.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I recollect it,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cbut that island,\nlike all the islands on Lake Tchad, is, no doubt, inhabited by a gang of\npirates and murderers. They certainly witnessed our misfortune, and should Joe\nfall into their hands, what will become of him unless protected by their\nsuperstitions?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, he\u2019s just the lad to get safely out of the scrape, I repeat. I\nhave great confidence in his shrewdness and skill.\u201d\n \n\u201cI hope so. Now, Dick, you may go and hunt in the neighborhood, but\ndon\u2019t get far away whatever you do. It has become a pressing necessity\nfor us to renew our stock of provisions, since we had to sacrifice nearly all\nthe old lot.\u201d\n \n\u201cVery good, doctor, I shall not be long absent.\u201d\n \nHereupon, Kennedy took a double-barrelled fowling-piece, and strode through the\nlong grass toward a thicket not far off, where the frequent sound of shooting\nsoon let the doctor know that the sportsman was making a good use of his time.\n \nMeanwhile Ferguson was engaged in calculating the relative weight of the\narticles still left in the car, and in establishing the equipoise of the second\nballoon. He found that there were still left some thirty pounds of pemmican, a\nsupply of tea and coffee, about a gallon and a half of brandy, and one empty\nwater-tank. All the dried meat had disappeared.\n \nThe doctor was aware that, by the loss of the hydrogen in the first balloon,\nthe ascensional force at his disposal was now reduced to about nine hundred\npounds. He therefore had to count upon this difference in order to rearrange\nhis equilibrium. The new balloon measured sixty-seven thousand cubic feet, and\ncontained thirty-three thousand four hundred and eighty feet of gas. The\ndilating apparatus appeared to be in good condition, and neither the battery\nnor the spiral had been injured.\n \nThe ascensional force of the new balloon was then about three thousand pounds,\nand, in adding together the weight of the apparatus, of the passengers, of the\nstock of water, of the car and its accessories, and putting aboard fifty\ngallons of water, and one hundred pounds of fresh meat, the doctor got a total\nweight of twenty-eight hundred and thirty pounds. He could then take with him\none hundred and seventy pounds of ballast, for unforeseen emergencies, and the\nballoon would be in exact balance with the surrounding atmosphere.\n \nHis arrangements were completed accordingly, and he made up for Joe\u2019s\nweight with a surplus of ballast. He spent the whole day in these preparations,\nand the latter were finished when Kennedy returned. The hunter had been\nsuccessful, and brought back a regular cargo of geese, wild-duck, snipe, teal,\nand plover. He went to work at once to draw and smoke the game. Each piece,\nsuspended on a small, thin skewer, was hung over a fire of green wood. When\nthey seemed in good order, Kennedy, who was perfectly at home in the business,\npacked them away in the car.\n \nOn the morrow, the hunter was to complete his supplies.\n \nEvening surprised our travellers in the midst of this work. Their supper\nconsisted of pemmican, biscuit, and tea; and fatigue, after having given them\nappetite, brought them sleep. Each of them strained eyes and ears into the\ngloom during his watch, sometimes fancying that they heard the voice of poor\nJoe; but, alas! the voice that they so longed to hear, was far away.\n \nAt the first streak of day, the doctor aroused Kennedy.\n \n\u201cI have been long and carefully considering what should be done,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cto find our companion.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhatever your plan may be, doctor, it will suit me. Speak!\u201d\n \n\u201cAbove all things, it is important that Joe should hear from us in some\nway.\u201d\n \n\u201cUndoubtedly. Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that\nwe have abandoned him?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe! He knows us too well for that. Such a thought would never come into\nhis mind. But he must be informed as to where we are.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow can that be managed?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall get into our car and be off again through the air.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, should the wind bear us away?\u201d\n \n\u201cHappily, it will not. See, Dick! it is carrying us back to the lake; and\nthis circumstance, which would have been vexatious yesterday, is fortunate now.\nOur efforts, then, will be limited to keeping ourselves above that vast sheet\nof water throughout the day. Joe cannot fail to see us, and his eyes will be\nconstantly on the lookout in that direction. Perhaps he will even manage to let\nus know the place of his retreat.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf he be alone and at liberty, he certainly will.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd if a prisoner,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cit not being the\npractice of the natives to confine their captives, he will see us, and\ncomprehend the object of our researches.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, at last,\u201d put in Kennedy\u2014\u201cfor we must anticipate\nevery thing\u2014should we find no trace\u2014if he should have left no mark\nto follow him by, what are we to do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall endeavor to regain the northern part of the lake, keeping\nourselves as much in sight as possible. There we\u2019ll wait; we\u2019ll\nexplore the banks; we\u2019ll search the water\u2019s edge, for Joe will\nassuredly try to reach the shore; and we will not leave the country without\nhaving done every thing to find him.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us set out, then!\u201d said the hunter.\n \nThe doctor hereupon took the exact bearings of the patch of solid land they\nwere about to leave, and arrived at the conclusion that it lay on the north\nshore of Lake Tchad, between the village of Lari and the village of Ingemini,\nboth visited by Major Denham. During this time Kennedy was completing his stock\nof fresh meat. Although the neighboring marshes showed traces of the\nrhinoceros, the lamantine (or manatee), and the hippopotamus, he had no\nopportunity to see a single specimen of those animals.\n \nAt seven in the morning, but not without great difficulty\u2014which to Joe\nwould have been nothing\u2014the balloon\u2019s anchor was detached from its\nhold, the gas dilated, and the new Victoria rose two hundred feet into\nthe air. It seemed to hesitate at first, and went spinning around, like a top;\nbut at last a brisk current caught it, and it advanced over the lake, and was\nsoon borne away at a speed of twenty miles per hour.\n \nThe doctor continued to keep at a height of from two hundred to five hundred\nfeet. Kennedy frequently discharged his rifle; and, when passing over islands,\nthe a\u00ebronauts approached them even imprudently, scrutinizing the thickets, the\nbushes, the underbrush\u2014in fine, every spot where a mass of shade or\njutting rock could have afforded a retreat to their companion. They swooped\ndown close to the long pirogues that navigated the lake; and the wild\nfishermen, terrified at the sight of the balloon, would plunge into the water\nand regain their islands with every symptom of undisguised affright.\n \n\u201cWe can see nothing,\u201d said Kennedy, after two hours of search.\n \n\u201cLet us wait a little longer, Dick, and not lose heart. We cannot be far\naway from the scene of our accident.\u201d\n \nBy eleven o\u2019clock the balloon had gone ninety miles. It then fell in with\na new current, which, blowing almost at right angles to the other, drove them\neastward about sixty miles. It next floated over a very large and populous\nisland, which the doctor took to be Farram, on which the capital of the\nBiddiomahs is situated. Ferguson expected at every moment to see Joe spring up\nout of some thicket, flying for his life, and calling for help. Were he free,\nthey could pick him up without trouble; were he a prisoner, they could rescue\nhim by repeating the man\u0153uvre they had practised to save the missionary, and he\nwould soon be with his friends again; but nothing was seen, not a sound was\nheard. The case seemed desperate.\n \nAbout half-past two o\u2019clock, the Victoria hove in sight of\nTangalia, a village situated on the eastern shore of Lake Tchad, where it marks\nthe extreme point attained by Denham at the period of his exploration.\n \nThe doctor became uneasy at this persistent setting of the wind in that\ndirection, for he felt that he was being thrown back to the eastward, toward\nthe centre of Africa, and the interminable deserts of that region.\n \n\u201cWe must absolutely come to a halt,\u201d said he, \u201cand even\nalight. For Joe\u2019s sake, particularly, we ought to go back to the lake;\nbut, to begin with, let us endeavor to find an opposite current.\u201d\n \nDuring more than an hour he searched at different altitudes: the balloon always\ncame back toward the mainland. But at length, at the height of a thousand feet,\na very violent breeze swept to the northwestward.\n \nIt was out of the question that Joe should have been detained on one of the\nislands of the lake; for, in such case he would certainly have found means to\nmake his presence there known. Perhaps he had been dragged to the mainland. The\ndoctor was reasoning thus to himself, when he again came in sight of the\nnorthern shore of Lake Tchad.\n \nAs for supposing that Joe had been drowned, that was not to be believed for a\nmoment. One horrible thought glanced across the minds of both Kennedy and the\ndoctor: caymans swarm in these waters! But neither one nor the other had the\ncourage to distinctly communicate this impression. However, it came up to them\nso forcibly at last that the doctor said, without further preface:\n \n\u201cCrocodiles are found only on the shores of the islands or of the lake,\nand Joe will have skill enough to avoid them. Besides, they are not very\ndangerous; and the Africans bathe with impunity, and quite fearless of their\nattacks.\u201d\n \nKennedy made no reply. He preferred keeping quiet to discussing this terrible\npossibility.\n \nThe doctor made out the town of Lari about five o\u2019clock in the evening.\nThe inhabitants were at work gathering in their cotton-crop in front of their\nhuts, constructed of woven reeds, and standing in the midst of clean and\nneatly-kept enclosures. This collection of about fifty habitations occupied a\nslight depression of the soil, in a valley extending between two low mountains.\nThe force of the wind carried the doctor farther onward than he wanted to go;\nbut it changed a second time, and bore him back exactly to his starting-point,\non the sort of enclosed island where he had passed the preceding night. The\nanchor, instead of catching the branches of the tree, took hold in the masses\nof reeds mixed with the thick mud of the marshes, which offered considerable\nresistance.\n \nThe doctor had much difficulty in restraining the balloon; but at length the\nwind died away with the setting in of nightfall; and the two friends kept watch\ntogether in an almost desperate state of mind.\n",
        "\n\nThe Hurricane.\u2014A Forced Departure.\u2014Loss of an\nAnchor.\u2014Melancholy Reflections.\u2014The Resolution adopted.\u2014The\nSand-Storm.\u2014The Buried Caravan.\u2014A Contrary yet Favorable\nWind.\u2014The Return southward.\u2014Kennedy at his Post.\n \nAt three o\u2019clock in the morning the wind was raging. It beat down with\nsuch violence that the Victoria could not stay near the ground without\ndanger. It was thrown almost flat over upon its side, and the reeds chafed the\nsilk so roughly that it seemed as though they would tear it.\n \n\u201cWe must be off, Dick,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwe cannot remain in\nthis situation.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, doctor, what of Joe?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am not likely to abandon him. No, indeed! and should the hurricane\ncarry me a thousand miles to the northward, I will return! But here we are\nendangering the safety of all.\u201d\n \n\u201cMust we go without him?\u201d asked the Scot, with an accent of\nprofound grief.\n \n\u201cAnd do you think, then,\u201d rejoined Ferguson, \u201cthat my heart\ndoes not bleed like your own? Am I not merely obeying an imperious\nnecessity?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am entirely at your orders,\u201d replied the hunter; \u201clet us\nstart!\u201d\n \nBut their departure was surrounded with unusual difficulty. The anchor, which\nhad caught very deeply, resisted all their efforts to disengage it; while the\nballoon, drawing in the opposite direction, increased its tension. Kennedy\ncould not get it free. Besides, in his present position, the man\u0153uvre had\nbecome a very perilous one, for the Victoria threatened to break away\nbefore he should be able to get into the car again.\n \nThe doctor, unwilling to run such a risk, made his friend get into his place,\nand resigned himself to the alternative of cutting the anchor-rope. The\nVictoria made one bound of three hundred feet into the air, and took her\nroute directly northward.\n \nFerguson had no other choice than to scud before the storm. He folded his arms,\nand soon became absorbed in his own melancholy reflections.\n \nAfter a few moments of profound silence, he turned to Kennedy, who sat there no\nless taciturn.\n \n\u201cWe have, perhaps, been tempting Providence,\u201d said he; \u201cit\ndoes not belong to man to undertake such a journey!\u201d\u2014and a sigh of\ngrief escaped him as he spoke.\n \n\u201cIt is but a few days,\u201d replied the sportsman, \u201csince we were\ncongratulating ourselves upon having escaped so many dangers! All three of us\nwere shaking hands!\u201d\n \n\u201cPoor Joe! kindly and excellent disposition! brave and candid heart!\nDazzled for a moment by his sudden discovery of wealth, he willingly sacrificed\nhis treasures! And now, he is far from us; and the wind is carrying us still\nfarther away with resistless speed!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, doctor, admitting that he may have found refuge among the lake\ntribes, can he not do as the travellers who visited them before us,\ndid;\u2014like Denham, like Barth? Both of those men got back to their own\ncountry.\u201d\n \n\u201cAh! my dear Dick! Joe doesn\u2019t know one word of the language; he is\nalone, and without resources. The travellers of whom you speak did not attempt\nto go forward without sending many presents in advance of them to the chiefs,\nand surrounded by an escort armed and trained for these expeditions. Yet, they\ncould not avoid sufferings of the worst description! What, then, can you expect\nthe fate of our companion to be? It is horrible to think of, and this is one of\nthe worst calamities that it has ever been my lot to endure!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, we\u2019ll come back again, doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cCome back, Dick? Yes, if we have to abandon the balloon! if we should be\nforced to return to Lake Tchad on foot, and put ourselves in communication with\nthe Sultan of Bornou! The Arabs cannot have retained a disagreeable remembrance\nof the first Europeans.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will follow you, doctor,\u201d replied the hunter, with emphasis.\n\u201cYou may count upon me! We would rather give up the idea of prosecuting\nthis journey than not return. Joe forgot himself for our sake; we will\nsacrifice ourselves for his!\u201d\n \nThis resolve revived some hope in the hearts of these two men; they felt strong\nin the same inspiration. Ferguson forthwith set every thing at work to get into\na contrary current, that might bring him back again to Lake Tchad; but this was\nimpracticable at that moment, and even to alight was out of the question on\nground completely bare of trees, and with such a hurricane blowing.\n \nThe Victoria thus passed over the country of the Tibbous, crossed the\nBelad el Djerid, a desert of briers that forms the border of the Soudan, and\nadvanced into the desert of sand streaked with the long tracks of the many\ncaravans that pass and repass there. The last line of vegetation was speedily\nlost in the dim southern horizon, not far from the principal oasis in this part\nof Africa, whose fifty wells are shaded by magnificent trees; but it was\nimpossible to stop. An Arab encampment, tents of striped stuff, some camels,\nstretching out their viper-like heads and necks along the sand, gave life to\nthis solitude, but the Victoria sped by like a shooting-star, and in\nthis way traversed a distance of sixty miles in three hours, without Ferguson\nbeing able to check or guide her course.\n \n\u201cWe cannot halt, we cannot alight!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cnot a\ntree, not an inequality of the ground! Are we then to be driven clear across\nSahara? Surely, Heaven is indeed against us!\u201d\n \nHe was uttering these words with a sort of despairing rage, when suddenly he\nsaw the desert sands rising aloft in the midst of a dense cloud of dust, and go\nwhirling through the air, impelled by opposing currents.\n \nAmid this tornado, an entire caravan, disorganized, broken, and overthrown, was\ndisappearing beneath an avalanche of sand. The camels, flung pell-mell\ntogether, were uttering dull and pitiful groans; cries and howls of despair\nwere heard issuing from that dusty and stifling cloud, and, from time to time,\na parti-colored garment cut the chaos of the scene with its vivid hues, and the\nmoaning and shrieking sounded over all, a terrible accompaniment to this\nspectacle of destruction.\n \nEre long the sand had accumulated in compact masses; and there, where so\nrecently stretched a level plain as far as the eye could see, rose now a ridgy\nline of hillocks, still moving from beneath\u2014the vast tomb of an entire\ncaravan!\n \nThe doctor and Kennedy, pallid with emotion, sat transfixed by this fearful\nspectacle. They could no longer manage their balloon, which went whirling round\nand round in contending currents, and refused to obey the different dilations\nof the gas. Caught in these eddies of the atmosphere, it spun about with a\nrapidity that made their heads reel, while the car oscillated and swung to and\nfro violently at the same time. The instruments suspended under the awning\nclattered together as though they would be dashed to pieces; the pipes of the\nspiral bent to and fro, threatening to break at every instant; and the\nwater-tanks jostled and jarred with tremendous din. Although but two feet\napart, our a\u00ebronauts could not hear each other speak, but with firmly-clinched\nhands they clung convulsively to the cordage, and endeavored to steady\nthemselves against the fury of the tempest.\n \nKennedy, with his hair blown wildly about his face, looked on without speaking;\nbut the doctor had regained all his daring in the midst of this deadly peril,\nand not a sign of his emotion was betrayed in his countenance, even when, after\na last violent twirl, the Victoria stopped suddenly in the midst of a\nmost unlooked-for calm; the north wind had abruptly got the upper hand, and now\ndrove her back with equal rapidity over the route she had traversed in the\nmorning.\n \n\u201cWhither are we going now?\u201d cried Kennedy.\n \n\u201cLet us leave that to Providence, my dear Dick; I was wrong in doubting\nit. It knows better than we, and here we are, returning to places that we had\nexpected never to see again!\u201d\n \nThe surface of the country, which had looked so flat and level when they were\ncoming, now seemed tossed and uneven, like the ocean-billows after a storm; a\nlong succession of hillocks, that had scarcely settled to their places yet,\nindented the desert; the wind blew furiously, and the balloon fairly flew\nthrough the atmosphere.\n \nThe direction taken by our a\u00ebronauts differed somewhat from that of the\nmorning, and thus about nine o\u2019clock, instead of finding themselves again\nnear the borders of Lake Tchad, they saw the desert still stretching away\nbefore them.\n \nKennedy remarked the circumstance.\n \n\u201cIt matters little,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cthe important point\nis to return southward; we shall come across the towns of Bornou, Wouddie, or\nKouka, and I should not hesitate to halt there.\u201d\n \n\u201cIf you are satisfied, I am content,\u201d replied the Scot, \u201cbut\nHeaven grant that we may not be reduced to cross the desert, as those\nunfortunate Arabs had to do! What we saw was frightful!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt often happens, Dick; these trips across the desert are far more\nperilous than those across the ocean. The desert has all the dangers of the\nsea, including the risk of being swallowed up, and added thereto are\nunendurable fatigues and privations.\u201d\n \n\u201cI think the wind shows some symptoms of moderating; the sand-dust is\nless dense; the undulations of the surface are diminishing, and the sky is\ngrowing clearer.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo much the better! We must now reconnoitre attentively with our\nglasses, and take care not to omit a single point.\u201d\n \n\u201cI will look out for that, doctor, and not a tree shall be seen without\nmy informing you of it.\u201d\n \nAnd, suiting the action to the word, Kennedy took his station, spy-glass in\nhand, at the forward part of the car.\n",
        "\n\nWhat happened to Joe.\u2014The Island of the Biddiomahs.\u2014The Adoration\nshown him.\u2014The Island that sank.\u2014The Shores of the Lake.\u2014The\nTree of the Serpents.\u2014The Foot-Tramp.\u2014Terrible\nSuffering.\u2014Mosquitoes and Ants.\u2014Hunger.\u2014The Victoria\nseen.\u2014She disappears.\u2014The Swamp.\u2014One Last Despairing Cry.\n \nWhat had become of Joe, while his master was thus vainly seeking for him?\n \nWhen he had dashed headlong into the lake, his first movement on coming to the\nsurface was to raise his eyes and look upward. He saw the Victoria\nalready risen far above the water, still rapidly ascending and growing smaller\nand smaller. It was soon caught in a rapid current and disappeared to the\nnorthward. His master\u2014both his friends were saved!\n \n\u201cHow lucky it was,\u201d thought he, \u201cthat I had that idea to\nthrow myself out into the lake! Mr. Kennedy would soon have jumped at it, and\nhe would not have hesitated to do as I did, for nothing\u2019s more natural\nthan for one man to give himself up to save two others. That\u2019s\nmathematics!\u201d\n \nSatisfied on this point, Joe began to think of himself. He was in the middle of\na vast lake, surrounded by tribes unknown to him, and probably ferocious. All\nthe greater reason why he should get out of the scrape by depending only on\nhimself. And so he gave himself no farther concern about it.\n \nBefore the attack by the birds of prey, which, according to him, had behaved\nlike real condors, he had noticed an island on the horizon, and determining to\nreach it, if possible, he put forth all his knowledge and skill in the art of\nswimming, after having relieved himself of the most troublesome part of his\nclothing. The idea of a stretch of five or six miles by no means disconcerted\nhim; and therefore, so long as he was in the open lake, he thought only of\nstriking out straight ahead and manfully.\n \nIn about an hour and a half the distance between him and the island had greatly\ndiminished.\n \nBut as he approached the land, a thought, at first fleeting and then tenacious,\narose in his mind. He knew that the shores of the lake were frequented by huge\nalligators, and was well aware of the voracity of those monsters.\n \nNow, no matter how much he was inclined to find every thing in this world quite\nnatural, the worthy fellow was no little disturbed by this reflection. He\nfeared greatly lest white flesh like his might be particularly acceptable to\nthe dreaded brutes, and advanced only with extreme precaution, his eyes on the\nalert on both sides and all around him. At length, he was not more than one\nhundred yards from a bank, covered with green trees, when a puff of air\nstrongly impregnated with a musky odor reached him.\n \n\u201cThere!\u201d said he to himself, \u201cjust what I expected. The\ncrocodile isn\u2019t far off!\u201d\n \nWith this he dived swiftly, but not sufficiently so to avoid coming into\ncontact with an enormous body, the scaly surface of which scratched him as he\npassed. He thought himself lost and swam with desperate energy. Then he rose\nagain to the top of the water, took breath and dived once more. Thus passed a\nfew minutes of unspeakable anguish, which all his philosophy could not\novercome, for he thought, all the while, that he heard behind him the sound of\nthose huge jaws ready to snap him up forever. In this state of mind he was\nstriking out under the water as noiselessly as possible when he felt himself\nseized by the arm and then by the waist.\n \nPoor Joe! he gave one last thought to his master; and began to struggle with\nall the energy of despair, feeling himself the while drawn along, but not\ntoward the bottom of the lake, as is the habit of the crocodile when about to\ndevour its prey, but toward the surface.\n \nSo soon as he could get breath and look around him, he saw that he was between\ntwo natives as black as ebony, who held him, with a firm grip, and uttered\nstrange cries.\n \n\u201cHa!\u201d said Joe, \u201cblacks instead of crocodiles! Well, I prefer\nit as it is; but how in the mischief dare these fellows go in bathing in such\nplaces?\u201d\n \nJoe was not aware that the inhabitants of the islands of Lake Tchad, like many\nother negro tribes, plunge with impunity into sheets of water infested with\ncrocodiles and caymans, and without troubling their heads about them. The\namphibious denizens of this lake enjoy the well-deserved reputation of being\nquite inoffensive.\n \nBut had not Joe escaped one peril only to fall into another? That was a\nquestion which he left events to decide; and, since he could not do otherwise,\nhe allowed himself to be conducted to the shore without manifesting any alarm.\n \n\u201cEvidently,\u201d thought he, \u201cthese chaps saw the Victoria\nskimming the waters of the lake, like a monster of the air. They were the\ndistant witnesses of my tumble, and they can\u2019t fail to have some respect\nfor a man that fell from the sky! Let them have their own way, then.\u201d\n \nJoe was at this stage of his meditations, when he was landed amid a yelling\ncrowd of both sexes, and all ages and sizes, but not of all colors. In fine, he\nwas surrounded by a tribe of Biddiomahs as black as jet. Nor had he to blush\nfor the scantiness of his costume, for he saw that he was in\n\u201cundress\u201d in the highest style of that country.\n \nBut before he had time to form an exact idea of the situation, there was no\nmistaking the agitation of which he instantly became the object, and this soon\nenabled him to pluck up courage, although the adventure of Kazeh did come back\nrather vividly to his memory.\n \n\u201cI foresee that they are going to make a god of me again,\u201d thought\nhe, \u201csome son of the moon most likely. Well, one trade\u2019s as good as\nanother when a man has no choice. The main thing is to gain time. Should the\nVictoria pass this way again, I\u2019ll take advantage of my new\nposition to treat my worshippers here to a miracle when I go sailing up into\nthe sky!\u201d\n \nWhile Joe\u2019s thoughts were running thus, the throng pressed around him.\nThey prostrated themselves before him; they howled; they felt him; they became\neven annoyingly familiar; but at the same time they had the consideration to\noffer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk and rice pounded in honey.\nThe worthy fellow, making the best of every thing, took one of the heartiest\nluncheons he ever ate in his life, and gave his new adorers an exalted idea of\nhow the gods tuck away their food upon grand occasions.\n \nWhen evening came, the sorcerers of the island took him respectfully by the\nhand, and conducted him to a sort of house surrounded with talismans; but, as\nhe was entering it, Joe cast an uneasy look at the heaps of human bones that\nlay scattered around this sanctuary. But he had still more time to think about\nthem when he found himself at last shut up in the cabin.\n \nDuring the evening and through a part of the night, he heard festive chantings,\nthe reverberations of a kind of drum, and a clatter of old iron, which were\nvery sweet, no doubt, to African ears. Then there were howling choruses,\naccompanied by endless dances by gangs of natives who circled round and round\nthe sacred hut with contortions and grimaces.\n \nJoe could catch the sound of this deafening orchestra, through the mud and\nreeds of which his cabin was built; and perhaps under other circumstances he\nmight have been amused by these strange ceremonies; but his mind was soon\ndisturbed by quite different and less agreeable reflections. Even looking at\nthe bright side of things, he found it both stupid and sad to be left alone in\nthe midst of this savage country and among these wild tribes. Few travellers\nwho had penetrated to these regions had ever again seen their native land.\nMoreover, could he trust to the worship of which he saw himself the object? He\nhad good reason to believe in the vanity of human greatness; and he asked\nhimself whether, in this country, adoration did not sometimes go to the length\nof eating the object adored!\n \nBut, notwithstanding this rather perplexing prospect, after some hours of\nmeditation, fatigue got the better of his gloomy thoughts, and Joe fell into a\nprofound slumber, which would have lasted no doubt until sunrise, had not a\nvery unexpected sensation of dampness awakened the sleeper. Ere long this\ndampness became water, and that water gained so rapidly that it had soon\nmounted to Joe\u2019s waist.\n \n\u201cWhat can this be?\u201d said he; \u201ca flood! a water-spout! or a\nnew torture invented by these blacks? Faith, though, I\u2019m not going to\nwait here till it\u2019s up to my neck!\u201d\n \nAnd, so saying, he burst through the frail wall with a jog of his powerful\nshoulder, and found himself\u2014where?\u2014in the open lake! Island there\nwas none. It had sunk during the night. In its place, the watery immensity of\nLake Tchad!\n \n\u201cA poor country for the land-owners!\u201d said Joe, once more\nvigorously resorting to his skill in the art of natation.\n \nOne of those phenomena, which are by no means unusual on Lake Tchad, had\nliberated our brave Joe. More than one island, that previously seemed to have\nthe solidity of rock, has been submerged in this way; and the people living\nalong the shores of the mainland have had to pick up the unfortunate survivors\nof these terrible catastrophes.\n \nJoe knew nothing about this peculiarity of the region, but he was none the less\nready to profit by it. He caught sight of a boat drifting about, without\noccupants, and was soon aboard of it. He found it to be but the trunk of a tree\nrudely hollowed out; but there were a couple of paddles in it, and Joe,\navailing himself of a rapid current, allowed his craft to float along.\n \n\u201cBut let us see where we are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe polar-star\nthere, that does its work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to\neverybody else, will, most likely, do me that service.\u201d\n \nHe discovered, with satisfaction, that the current was taking him toward the\nnorthern shore of the lake, and he allowed himself to glide with it. About two\no\u2019clock in the morning he disembarked upon a promontory covered with\nprickly reeds, that proved very provoking and inconvenient even to a\nphilosopher like him; but a tree grew there expressly to offer him a bed among\nits branches, and Joe climbed up into it for greater security, and there,\nwithout sleeping much, however, awaited the dawn of day.\n \nWhen morning had come with that suddenness which is peculiar to the equatorial\nregions, Joe cast a glance at the tree which had sheltered him during the last\nfew hours, and beheld a sight that chilled the marrow in his bones. The\nbranches of the tree were literally covered with snakes and chameleons! The\nfoliage actually was hidden beneath their coils, so that the beholder might\nhave fancied that he saw before him a new kind of tree that bore reptiles for\nits leaves and fruit. And all this horrible living mass writhed and twisted in\nthe first rays of the morning sun! Joe experienced a keen sensation or terror\nmingled with disgust, as he looked at it, and he leaped precipitately from the\ntree amid the hissings of these new and unwelcome bedfellows.\n \n\u201cNow, there\u2019s something that I would never have believed!\u201d\nsaid he.\n \nHe was not aware that Dr. Vogel\u2019s last letters had made known this\nsingular feature of the shores of Lake Tchad, where reptiles are more numerous\nthan in any other part of the world. But after what he had just seen, Joe\ndetermined to be more circumspect for the future; and, taking his bearings by\nthe sun, he set off afoot toward the northeast, avoiding with the utmost care\ncabins, huts, hovels, and dens of every description, that might serve in any\nmanner as a shelter for human beings.\n \nHow often his gaze was turned upward to the sky! He hoped to catch a glimpse,\neach time, of the Victoria; and, although he looked vainly during all\nthat long, fatiguing day of sore foot-travel, his confident reliance on his\nmaster remained undiminished. Great energy of character was needed to enable\nhim thus to sustain the situation with philosophy. Hunger conspired with\nfatigue to crush him, for a man\u2019s system is not greatly restored and\nfortified by a diet of roots, the pith of plants, such as the m\u00e9l\u00e9, or\nthe fruit of the doum palm-tree; and yet, according to his own\ncalculations, Joe was enabled to push on about twenty miles to the westward.\n \nHis body bore in scores of places the marks of the thorns with which the\nlake-reeds, the acacias, the mimosas, and other wild shrubbery through which he\nhad to force his way, are thickly studded; and his torn and bleeding feet\nrendered walking both painful and difficult. But at length he managed to react\nagainst all these sufferings; and when evening came again, he resolved to pass\nthe night on the shores of Lake Tchad.\n \nThere he had to endure the bites of myriads of insects\u2014gnats, mosquitoes,\nants half an inch long, literally covered the ground; and, in less than two\nhours, Joe had not a rag remaining of the garments that had covered him, the\ninsects having devoured them! It was a terrible night, that did not yield our\nexhausted traveller an hour of sleep. During all this time the wild-boars and\nnative buffaloes, re\u00ebnforced by the ajoub\u2014a very dangerous species\nof lamantine\u2014carried on their ferocious revels in the bushes and\nunder the waters of the lake, filling the night with a hideous concert. Joe\ndared scarcely breathe. Even his courage and coolness had hard work to bear up\nagainst so terrible a situation.\n \nAt length, day came again, and Joe sprang to his feet precipitately; but judge\nof the loathing he felt when he saw what species of creature had shared his\ncouch\u2014a toad!\u2014but a toad five inches in length, a monstrous,\nrepulsive specimen of vermin that sat there staring at him with huge round\neyes. Joe felt his stomach revolt at the sight, and, regaining a little\nstrength from the intensity of his repugnance, he rushed at the top of his\nspeed and plunged into the lake. This sudden bath somewhat allayed the pangs of\nthe itching that tortured his whole body; and, chewing a few leaves, he set\nforth resolutely, again feeling an obstinate resolution in the act, for which\nhe could hardly account even to his own mind. He no longer seemed to have\nentire control of his own acts, and, nevertheless, he felt within him a\nstrength superior to despair.\n \nHowever, he began now to suffer terribly from hunger. His stomach, less\nresigned than he was, rebelled, and he was obliged to fasten a tendril of\nwild-vine tightly about his waist. Fortunately, he could quench his thirst at\nany moment, and, in recalling the sufferings he had undergone in the desert, he\nexperienced comparative relief in his exemption from that other distressing\nwant.\n \n\u201cWhat can have become of the Victoria?\u201d he wondered.\n\u201cThe wind blows from the north, and she should be carried back by it\ntoward the lake. No doubt the doctor has gone to work to right her balance, but\nyesterday would have given him time enough for that, so that may be\nto-day\u2014but I must act just as if I was never to see him again. After all,\nif I only get to one of the large towns on the lake, I\u2019ll find myself no\nworse off than the travellers my master used to talk about. Why shouldn\u2019t\nI work my way out of the scrape as well as they did? Some of them got back home\nagain. Come, then! the deuce! Cheer up, my boy!\u201d\n \nThus talking to himself and walking on rapidly, Joe came right upon a horde of\nnatives in the very depths of the forest, but he halted in time and was not\nseen by them. The negroes were busy poisoning arrows with the juice of the\neuphorbium\u2014a piece of work deemed a great affair among these\nsavage tribes, and carried on with a sort of ceremonial solemnity.\n \nJoe, entirely motionless and even holding his breath, was keeping himself\nconcealed in a thicket, when, happening to raise his eyes, he saw through an\nopening in the foliage the welcome apparition of the balloon\u2014the\nVictoria herself\u2014moving toward the lake, at a height of only about\none hundred feet above him. But he could not make himself heard; he dared not,\ncould not make his friends even see him!\n \nTears came to his eyes, not of grief but of thankfulness; his master was then\nseeking him; his master had not left him to perish! He would have to wait for\nthe departure of the blacks; then he could quit his hiding-place and run toward\nthe borders of Lake Tchad!\n \nBut by this time the Victoria was disappearing in the distant sky. Joe\nstill determined to wait for her; she would come back again, undoubtedly. She\ndid, indeed, return, but farther to the eastward. Joe ran, gesticulated,\nshouted\u2014but all in vain! A strong breeze was sweeping the balloon away\nwith a speed that deprived him of all hope.\n \nFor the first time, energy and confidence abandoned the heart of the\nunfortunate man. He saw that he was lost. He thought his master gone beyond all\nprospect of return. He dared no longer think; he would no longer reflect!\n \nLike a crazy man, his feet bleeding, his body cut and torn, he walked on during\nall that day and a part of the next night. He even dragged himself along,\nsometimes on his knees, sometimes with his hands. He saw the moment nigh when\nall his strength would fail, and nothing would be left to him but to sink upon\nthe ground and die.\n \nThus working his way along, he at length found himself close to a marsh, or\nwhat he knew would soon become a marsh, for night had set in some hours before,\nand he fell by a sudden misstep into a thick, clinging mire. In spite of all\nhis efforts, in spite of his desperate struggles, he felt himself sinking\ngradually in the swampy ooze, and in a few minutes he was buried to his waist.\n \n\u201cHere, then, at last, is death!\u201d he thought, in agony, \u201cand\nwhat a death!\u201d\n \nHe now began to struggle again, like a madman; but his efforts only served to\nbury him deeper in the tomb that the poor doomed lad was hollowing for himself;\nnot a log of wood or a branch to buoy him up; not a reed to which he might\ncling! He felt that all was over! His eyes convulsively closed!\n \n\u201cMaster! master!\u2014Help!\u201d were his last words; but his voice,\ndespairing, unaided, half stifled already by the rising mire, died away feebly\non the night.\n",

It is impossible to make them out yet, but I\nobserve that they are in violent motion, for they are raising a great cloud of\ndust.\u201d\n \n\u201cMay it not be another contrary breeze?\u201d said the doctor,\n\u201canother whirlwind coming to drive us back northward again?\u201d and\nwhile speaking he stood up to examine the horizon.\n \n\u201cI think not, Samuel; it is a troop of gazelles or of wild oxen.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerhaps so, Dick; but yon throng is some nine or ten miles from us at\nleast, and on my part, even with the glass, I can make nothing of it!\u201d\n \n\u201cAt all events I shall not lose sight of it. There is something\nremarkable about it that excites my curiosity. Sometimes it looks like a body\nof cavalry man\u0153uvring. Ah! I was not mistaken. It is, indeed, a squadron of\nhorsemen. Look\u2014look there!\u201d\n \nThe doctor eyed the group with great attention, and, after a moment\u2019s\npause, remarked:\n \n\u201cI believe that you are right. It is a detachment of Arabs or Tibbous,\nand they are galloping in the same direction with us, as though in flight, but\nwe are going faster than they, and we are rapidly gaining on them. In half an\nhour we shall be near enough to see them and know what they are.\u201d\n \nKennedy had again lifted his glass and was attentively scrutinizing them.\nMeanwhile the crowd of horsemen was becoming more distinctly visible, and a few\nwere seen to detach themselves from the main body.\n \n\u201cIt is some hunting man\u0153uvre, evidently,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\u201cThose fellows seem to be in pursuit of something. I would like to know\nwhat they are about.\u201d\n \n\u201cPatience, Dick! In a little while we shall overtake them, if they\ncontinue on the same route. We are going at the rate of twenty miles per hour,\nand no horse can keep up with that.\u201d\n \nKennedy again raised his glass, and a few minutes later he exclaimed:\n \n\u201cThey are Arabs, galloping at the top of their speed; I can make them out\ndistinctly. They are about fifty in number. I can see their bournouses\npuffed out by the wind. It is some cavalry exercise that they are going\nthrough. Their chief is a hundred paces ahead of them and they are rushing\nafter him at headlong speed.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhoever they may be, Dick, they are not to be feared, and then, if\nnecessary, we can go higher.\u201d\n \n\u201cWait, doctor\u2014wait a little!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s curious,\u201d said Kennedy again, after a brief pause,\n\u201cbut there\u2019s something going on that I can\u2019t exactly explain.\nBy the efforts they make, and the irregularity of their line, I should fancy\nthat those Arabs are pursuing some one, instead of following.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre you certain of that, Dick?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! yes, it\u2019s clear enough now. I am right! It is a\npursuit\u2014a hunt\u2014but a man-hunt! That is not their chief riding ahead\nof them, but a fugitive.\u201d\n \n\u201cA fugitive!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, growing more and more\ninterested.\n \n\u201cYes!\u201d\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t lose sight of him, and let us wait!\u201d\n \nThree or four miles more were quickly gained upon these horsemen, who\nnevertheless were dashing onward with incredible speed.\n \n\u201cDoctor! doctor!\u201d shouted Kennedy in an agitated voice.\n \n\u201cWhat is the matter, Dick?\u201d\n \n\u201cIs it an illusion? Can it be possible?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \n\u201cWait!\u201d and so saying, the Scot wiped the sights of his spy-glass\ncarefully, and looked through it again intently.\n \n\u201cWell?\u201d questioned the doctor.\n \n\u201cIt is he, doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe!\u201d exclaimed Ferguson with emotion.\n \n\u201cIt is he! no other!\u201d and it was needless to pronounce the name.\n \n\u201cYes! it is he! on horseback, and only a hundred paces in advance of his\nenemies! He is pursued!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is Joe\u2014Joe himself!\u201d cried the doctor, turning pale.\n \n\u201cHe cannot see us in his flight!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe will see us, though!\u201d said the doctor, lowering the flame of\nhis blow-pipe.\n \n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n \n\u201cIn five minutes we shall be within fifty feet of the ground, and in\nfifteen we shall be right over him!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe must let him know it by firing a gun!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! he can\u2019t turn back to come this way. He\u2019s headed\noff!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat shall we do, then?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe must wait.\u201d\n \n\u201cWait?\u2014and these Arabs!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall overtake them. We\u2019ll pass them. We are not more than two\nmiles from them, and provided that Joe\u2019s horse holds out!\u201d\n \n\u201cGreat God!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, suddenly.\n \n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\n \nKennedy had uttered a cry of despair as he saw Joe fling himself to the ground.\nHis horse, evidently exhausted, had just fallen headlong.\n \n\u201cHe sees us!\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cand he motions to us, as he\ngets upon his feet!\u201d\n \n\u201cBut the Arabs will overtake him! What is he waiting for? Ah! the brave\nlad! Huzza!\u201d shouted the sportsman, who could no longer restrain his\nfeelings.\n \nJoe, who had immediately sprung up after his fall, just as one of the swiftest\nhorsemen rushed upon him, bounded like a panther, avoided his assailant by\nleaping to one side, jumped up behind him on the crupper, seized the Arab by\nthe throat, and, strangling him with his sinewy hands and fingers of steel,\nflung him on the sand, and continued his headlong flight.\n \nA tremendous howl was heard from the Arabs, but, completely engrossed by the\npursuit, they had not taken notice of the balloon, which was now but five\nhundred paces behind them, and only about thirty feet from the ground. On their\npart, they were not twenty lengths of their horses from the fugitive.\n \nOne of them was very perceptibly gaining on Joe, and was about to pierce him\nwith his lance, when Kennedy, with fixed eye and steady hand, stopped him short\nwith a ball, that hurled him to the earth.\n \nJoe did not even turn his head at the report. Some of the horsemen reined in\ntheir barbs, and fell on their faces in the dust as they caught sight of the\nVictoria; the rest continued their pursuit.\n \n\u201cBut what is Joe about?\u201d said Kennedy; \u201che don\u2019t\nstop!\u201d\n \n\u201cHe\u2019s doing better than that, Dick! I understand him! He\u2019s\nkeeping on in the same direction as the balloon. He relies upon our\nintelligence. Ah! the noble fellow! We\u2019ll carry him off in the very teeth\nof those Arab rascals! We are not more than two hundred paces from him!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cLay aside your rifle, Dick.\u201d\n \nAnd the Scot obeyed the request at once.\n \n\u201cDo you think that you can hold one hundred and fifty pounds of ballast\nin your arms?\u201d\n \n\u201cAy, more than that!\u201d\n \n\u201cNo! That will be enough!\u201d\n \nAnd the doctor proceeded to pile up bags of sand in Kennedy\u2019s arms.\n \n\u201cHold yourself in readiness in the back part of the car, and be prepared\nto throw out that ballast at a single effort. But, for your life, don\u2019t\ndo so until I give the word!\u201d\n \n\u201cBe easy on that point.\u201d\n \n\u201cOtherwise, we should miss Joe, and he would be lost.\u201d\n \n\u201cCount upon me!\u201d\n \nThe Victoria at that moment almost commanded the troop of horsemen who\nwere still desperately urging their steeds at Joe\u2019s heels. The doctor,\nstanding in the front of the car, held the ladder clear, ready to throw it at\nany moment. Meanwhile, Joe had still maintained the distance between himself\nand his pursuers\u2014say about fifty feet. The Victoria was now ahead\nof the party.\n \n\u201cAttention!\u201d exclaimed the doctor to Kennedy.\n \n\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d\n \n\u201cJoe, look out for yourself!\u201d shouted the doctor in his sonorous,\nringing voice, as he flung out the ladder, the lowest ratlines of which tossed\nup the dust of the road.\n \nAs the doctor shouted, Joe had turned his head, but without checking his horse.\nThe ladder dropped close to him, and at the instant he grasped it the doctor\nagain shouted to Kennedy:\n \n\u201cThrow ballast!\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d\n \nAnd the Victoria, lightened by a weight greater than Joe\u2019s, shot\nup one hundred and fifty feet into the air.\n \nJoe clung with all his strength to the ladder during the wide oscillations that\nit had to describe, and then making an indescribable gesture to the Arabs, and\nclimbing with the agility of a monkey, he sprang up to his companions, who\nreceived him with open arms.\n \nThe Arabs uttered a scream of astonishment and rage. The fugitive had been\nsnatched from them on the wing, and the Victoria was rapidly speeding\nfar beyond their reach.\n \n\u201cMaster! Kennedy!\u201d ejaculated Joe, and overwhelmed, at last, with\nfatigue and emotion, the poor fellow fainted away, while Kennedy, almost beside\nhimself, kept exclaiming:\n \n\u201cSaved\u2014saved!\u201d\n \n\u201cSaved indeed!\u201d murmured the doctor, who had recovered all his\nphlegmatic coolness.\n \nJoe was almost naked. His bleeding arms, his body covered with cuts and\nbruises, told what his sufferings had been. The doctor quietly dressed his\nwounds, and laid him comfortably under the awning.\n \nJoe soon returned to consciousness, and asked for a glass of brandy, which the\ndoctor did not see fit to refuse, as the faithful fellow had to be indulged.\n \nAfter he had swallowed the stimulant, Joe grasped the hands of his two friends\nand announced that he was ready to relate what had happened to him.\n \nBut they would not allow him to talk at that time, and he sank back into a\nprofound sleep, of which he seemed to have the greatest possible need.\n \nThe Victoria was then taking an oblique line to the westward. Driven by\na tempestuous wind, it again approached the borders of the thorny desert, which\nthe travellers descried over the tops of palm-trees, bent and broken by the\nstorm; and, after having made a run of two hundred miles since rescuing Joe, it\npassed the tenth degree of east longitude about nightfall.\n",

The doctor and Kennedy kept watch by turns, and Joe availed himself\nof the chance to sleep most sturdily for twenty-four hours at a stretch.\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s the remedy he needs,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson.\n\u201cNature will take charge of his care.\u201d\n \nWith the dawn the wind sprang up again in quite strong, and moreover capricious\ngusts. It shifted abruptly from south to north, but finally the Victoria\nwas carried away by it toward the west.\n \nThe doctor, map in hand, recognized the kingdom of Damerghou, an undulating\nregion of great fertility, in which the huts that compose the villages are\nconstructed of long reeds interwoven with branches of the asclepia. The\ngrain-mills were seen raised in the cultivated fields, upon small scaffoldings\nor platforms, to keep them out of the reach of the mice and the huge ants of\nthat country.\n \nThey soon passed the town of Zinder, recognized by its spacious place of\nexecution, in the centre of which stands the \u201ctree of death.\u201d At\nits foot the executioner stands waiting, and whoever passes beneath its shadow\nis immediately hung!\n \nUpon consulting his compass, Kennedy could not refrain from saying:\n \n\u201cLook! we are again moving northward.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo matter; if it only takes us to Timbuctoo, we shall not complain.\nNever was a finer voyage accomplished under better circumstances!\u201d\n \n\u201cNor in better health,\u201d said Joe, at that instant thrusting his\njolly countenance from between the curtains of the awning.\n \n\u201cThere he is! there\u2019s our gallant friend\u2014our\npreserver!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, cordially.\u2014\u201cHow goes it,\nJoe?\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! why, naturally enough, Mr. Kennedy, very naturally! I never felt\nbetter in my life! Nothing sets a man up like a little pleasure-trip with a\nbath in Lake Tchad to start on\u2014eh, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cBrave fellow!\u201d said Ferguson, pressing Joe\u2019s hand,\n\u201cwhat terrible anxiety you caused us!\u201d\n \n\u201cHumph! and you, sir? Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about you,\ngentlemen? You gave me a fine fright, let me tell you!\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall never agree in the world, Joe, if you take things in that\nstyle.\u201d\n \n\u201cI see that his tumble hasn\u2019t changed him a bit,\u201d added\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cYour devotion and self-forgetfulness were sublime, my brave lad, and\nthey saved us, for the Victoria was falling into the lake, and, once\nthere, nobody could have extricated her.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut, if my devotion, as you are pleased to call my summerset, saved you,\ndid it not save me too, for here we are, all three of us, in first-rate health?\nConsequently we have nothing to squabble about in the whole affair.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh! we can never come to a settlement with that youth,\u201d said the\nsportsman.\n \n\u201cThe best way to settle it,\u201d replied Joe, \u201cis to say nothing\nmore about the matter. What\u2019s done is done. Good or bad, we can\u2019t\ntake it back.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou obstinate fellow!\u201d said the doctor, laughing; \u201cyou\ncan\u2019t refuse, though, to tell us your adventures, at all events.\u201d\n \n\u201cNot if you think it worth while. But, in the first place, I\u2019m\ngoing to cook this fat goose to a turn, for I see that Mr. Kennedy has not\nwasted his time.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right, Joe!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, let us see then how this African game will sit on a European\nstomach!\u201d\n \nThe goose was soon roasted by the flame of the blow-pipe, and not long\nafterward was comfortably stowed away. Joe took his own good share, like a man\nwho had eaten nothing for several days. After the tea and the punch, he\nacquainted his friends with his recent adventures. He spoke with some emotion,\neven while looking at things with his usual philosophy. The doctor could not\nrefrain from frequently pressing his hand when he saw his worthy servant more\nconsiderate of his master\u2019s safety than of his own, and, in relation to\nthe sinking of the island of the Biddiomahs, he explained to him the frequency\nof this phenomenon upon Lake Tchad.\n \nAt length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where, sinking in\nthe swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.\n \n\u201cI thought I was gone,\u201d said he, \u201cand as you came right into\nmy mind, I made a hard fight for it. How, I couldn\u2019t tell you\u2014but\nI\u2019d made up my mind that I wouldn\u2019t go under without knowing why.\nJust then, I saw\u2014two or three feet from me\u2014what do you think? the\nend of a rope that had been fresh cut; so I took leave to make another jerk,\nand, by hook or by crook, I got to the rope. When I pulled, it didn\u2019t\ngive; so I pulled again and hauled away and there I was on dry ground! At the\nend of the rope, I found an anchor! Ah, master, I\u2019ve a right to call that\nthe anchor of safety, anyhow, if you have no objection. I knew it again! It was\nthe anchor of the Victoria! You had grounded there! So I followed the\ndirection of the rope and that gave me your direction, and, after trying hard a\nfew times more, I got out of the swamp. I had got my strength back with my\nspunk, and I walked on part of the night away from the lake, until I got to the\nedge of a very big wood. There I saw a fenced-in place, where some horses were\ngrazing, without thinking of any harm. Now, there are times when everybody\nknows how to ride a horse, are there not, doctor? So I didn\u2019t spend much\ntime thinking about it, but jumped right on the back of one of those innocent\nanimals and away we went galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us. I\nneedn\u2019t tell you about the towns that I didn\u2019t see nor the villages\nthat I took good care to go around. No! I crossed the ploughed fields; I leaped\nthe hedges; I scrambled over the fences; I dug my heels into my nag; I thrashed\nhim; I fairly lifted the poor fellow off his feet! At last I got to the end of\nthe tilled land. Good! There was the desert. \u2018That suits me!\u2019 said\nI, \u2018for I can see better ahead of me and farther too.\u2019 I was hoping\nall the time to see the balloon tacking about and waiting for me. But not a bit\nof it; and so, in about three hours, I go plump, like a fool, into a camp of\nArabs! Whew! what a hunt that was! You see, Mr. Kennedy, a hunter don\u2019t\nknow what a real hunt is until he\u2019s been hunted himself! Still I advise\nhim not to try it if he can keep out of it! My horse was so tired, he was ready\nto drop off his legs; they were close on me; I threw myself to the ground; then\nI jumped up again behind an Arab! I didn\u2019t mean the fellow any harm, and\nI hope he has no grudge against me for choking him, but I saw you\u2014and you\nknow the rest. The Victoria came on at my heels, and you caught me up\nflying, as a circus-rider does a ring. Wasn\u2019t I right in counting on you?\nNow, doctor, you see how simple all that was! Nothing more natural in the\nworld! I\u2019m ready to begin over again, if it would be of any service to\nyou. And besides, master, as I said a while ago, it\u2019s not worth\nmentioning.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy noble, gallant Joe!\u201d said the doctor, with great feeling.\n\u201cHeart of gold! we were not astray in trusting to your intelligence and\nskill.\u201d\n \n\u201cPoh! doctor, one has only just to follow things along as they happen,\nand he can always work his way out of a scrape! The safest plan, you see, is to\ntake matters as they come.\u201d\n \nWhile Joe was telling his experience, the balloon had rapidly passed over a\nlong reach of country, and Kennedy soon pointed out on the horizon a collection\nof structures that looked like a town. The doctor glanced at his map and\nrecognized the place as the large village of Tagelei, in the Damerghou country.\n \n\u201cHere,\u201d said he, \u201cwe come upon Dr. Barth\u2019s route. It\nwas at this place that he parted from his companions, Richardson and Overweg;\nthe first was to follow the Zinder route, and the second that of Maradi; and\nyou may remember that, of these three travellers, Barth was the only one who\never returned to Europe.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen,\u201d said Kennedy, following out on the map the direction of the\nVictoria, \u201cwe are going due north.\u201d\n \n\u201cDue north, Dick.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd don\u2019t that give you a little uneasiness?\u201d\n \n\u201cWhy should it?\u201d\n \n\u201cBecause that line leads to Tripoli, and over the Great Desert.\u201d\n \n\u201cOh, we shall not go so far as that, my friend\u2014at least, I hope\nnot.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut where do you expect to halt?\u201d\n \n\u201cCome, Dick, don\u2019t you feel some curiosity to see Timbuctoo?\u201d\n \n\u201cTimbuctoo?\u201d\n \n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Joe; \u201cnobody nowadays can think of making\nthe trip to Africa without going to see Timbuctoo.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou will be only the fifth or sixth European who has ever set eyes on\nthat mysterious city.\u201d\n \n\u201cHo, then, for Timbuctoo!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, then, let us try to get as far as between the seventeenth and\neighteenth degrees of north latitude, and there we will seek a favorable wind\nto carry us westward.\u201d\n \n\u201cGood!\u201d said the hunter. \u201cBut have we still far to go to the\nnorthward?\u201d\n \n\u201cOne hundred and fifty miles at least.\u201d\n \n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cI\u2019ll turn in and sleep a\nbit.\u201d\n \n\u201cSleep, sir; sleep!\u201d urged Joe. \u201cAnd you, doctor, do the same\nyourself: you must have need of rest, for I made you keep watch a little out of\ntime.\u201d\n \nThe sportsman stretched himself under the awning; but Ferguson, who was not\neasily conquered by fatigue, remained at his post.\n \nIn about three hours the Victoria was crossing with extreme rapidity an\nexpanse of stony country, with ranges of lofty, naked mountains of granitic\nformation at the base. A few isolated peaks attained the height of even four\nthousand feet. Giraffes, antelopes, and ostriches were seen running and\nbounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of acacias, mimosas,\nsouahs, and date-trees. After the barrenness of the desert, vegetation was now\nresuming its empire. This was the country of the Kailouas, who veil their faces\nwith a bandage of cotton, like their dangerous neighbors, the Touaregs.\n \nAt ten o\u2019clock in the evening, after a splendid trip of two hundred and\nfifty miles, the Victoria halted over an important town. The moonlight\nrevealed glimpses of one district half in ruins; and some pinnacles of mosques\nand minarets shot up here and there, glistening in the silvery rays. The doctor\ntook a stellar observation, and discovered that he was in the latitude of\nAghades.\n \nThis city, once the seat of an immense trade, was already falling into ruin\nwhen Dr. Barth visited it.\n \nThe Victoria, not being seen in the obscurity of night, descended about\ntwo miles above Aghades, in a field of millet. The night was calm, and began to\nbreak into dawn about three o\u2019clock A.M.; while a light\nwind coaxed the balloon westward, and even a little toward the south.\n \nDr. Ferguson hastened to avail himself of such good fortune, and rapidly\nascending resumed his a\u00ebrial journey amid a long wake of golden morning\nsunshine.\n",
        "\n\nA Rapid Passage.\u2014Prudent Resolves.\u2014Caravans in\nSight.\u2014Incessant Rains.\u2014Goa.\u2014The Niger.\u2014Golberry,\nGeoffroy, and Gray.\u2014Mungo Park.\u2014Laing.\u2014Ren\u00e9\nCailli\u00e9.\u2014Clapperton.\u2014John and Richard Lander.\n \nThe 17th of May passed tranquilly, without any remarkable incident; the desert\ngained upon them once more; a moderate wind bore the Victoria toward the\nsouthwest, and she never swerved to the right or to the left, but her shadow\ntraced a perfectly straight line on the sand.\n \nBefore starting, the doctor had prudently renewed his stock of water, having\nfeared that he should not be able to touch ground in these regions, infested as\nthey are by the Aouelim-Minian Touaregs. The plateau, at an elevation of\neighteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, sloped down toward the south.\nOur travellers, having crossed the Aghades route at Murzouk\u2014a route often\npressed by the feet of camels\u2014arrived that evening, in the sixteenth\ndegree of north latitude, and four degrees fifty-five minutes east longitude,\nafter having passed over one hundred and eighty miles of a long and monotonous\nday\u2019s journey.\n \nDuring the day Joe dressed the last pieces of game, which had been only hastily\nprepared, and he served up for supper a mess of snipe, that were greatly\nrelished. The wind continuing good, the doctor resolved to keep on during the\nnight, the moon, still nearly at the full, illumining it with her radiance. The\nVictoria ascended to a height of five hundred feet, and, during her\nnocturnal trip of about sixty miles, the gentle slumbers of an infant would not\nhave been disturbed by her motion.\n \nOn Sunday morning, the direction of the wind again changed, and it bore to the\nnorthwestward. A few crows were seen sweeping through the air, and, off on the\nhorizon, a flock of vultures which, fortunately, however, kept at a distance.\n \nThe sight of these birds led Joe to compliment his master on the idea of having\ntwo balloons.\n \n\u201cWhere would we be,\u201d said he, \u201cwith only one balloon? The\nsecond balloon is like the life-boat to a ship; in case of wreck we could\nalways take to it and escape.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou are right, friend Joe,\u201d said the doctor, \u201conly that my\nlife-boat gives me some uneasiness. It is not so good as the main craft.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat do you mean by that, doctor?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cI mean to say that the new Victoria is not so good as the old\none. Whether it be that the stuff it is made of is too much worn, or that the\nheat of the spiral has melted the gutta-percha, I can observe a certain loss of\ngas. It don\u2019t amount to much thus far, but still it is noticeable. We\nhave a tendency to sink, and, in order to keep our elevation, I am compelled to\ngive greater dilation to the hydrogen.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe deuce!\u201d exclaimed Kennedy with concern; \u201cI see no remedy\nfor that.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere is none, Dick, and that is why we must hasten our progress, and\neven avoid night halts.\u201d\n \n\u201cAre we still far from the coast?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cWhich coast, my boy? How are we to know whither chance will carry us?\nAll that I can say is, that Timbuctoo is still about four hundred miles to the\nwestward.\n \n\u201cAnd how long will it take us to get there?\u201d\n \n\u201cShould the wind not carry us too far out of the way, I hope to reach\nthat city by Tuesday evening.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen,\u201d remarked Joe, pointing to a long file of animals and men\nwinding across the open desert, \u201cwe shall arrive there sooner than that\ncaravan.\u201d\n \nFerguson and Kennedy leaned over and saw an immense cavalcade. There were at\nleast one hundred and fifty camels of the kind that, for twelve mutkals\nof gold, or about twenty-five dollars, go from Timbuctoo to Tafilet with a load\nof five hundred pounds upon their backs. Each animal had dangling to its tail a\nbag to receive its excrement, the only fuel on which the caravans can depend\nwhen crossing the desert.\n \nThese Touareg camels are of the very best race. They can go from three to seven\ndays without drinking, and for two without eating. Their speed surpasses that\nof the horse, and they obey with intelligence the voice of the khabir,\nor guide of the caravan. They are known in the country under the name of\nmehari.\n \nSuch were the details given by the doctor while his companions continued to\ngaze upon that multitude of men, women, and children, advancing on foot and\nwith difficulty over a waste of sand half in motion, and scarcely kept in its\nplace by scanty nettles, withered grass, and stunted bushes that grew upon it.\nThe wind obliterated the marks of their feet almost instantly.\n \nJoe inquired how the Arabs managed to guide themselves across the desert, and\ncome to the few wells scattered far between throughout this vast solitude.\n \n\u201cThe Arabs,\u201d replied Dr. Ferguson, \u201care endowed by nature\nwith a wonderful instinct in finding their way. Where a European would be at a\nloss, they never hesitate for a moment. An insignificant fragment of rock, a\npebble, a tuft of grass, a different shade of color in the sand, suffice to\nguide them with accuracy. During the night they go by the polar star. They\nnever travel more than two miles per hour, and always rest during the noonday\nheat. You may judge from that how long it takes them to cross Sahara, a desert\nmore than nine hundred miles in breadth.\u201d\n \nBut the Victoria had already disappeared from the astonished gaze of the\nArabs, who must have envied her rapidity. That evening she passed two degrees\ntwenty minutes east longitude, and during the night left another degree behind\nher.\n \nOn Monday the weather changed completely. Rain began to fall with extreme\nviolence, and not only had the balloon to resist the power of this deluge, but\nalso the increase of weight which it caused by wetting the whole machine, car\nand all. This continuous shower accounted for the swamps and marshes that\nformed the sole surface of the country. Vegetation reappeared, however, along\nwith the mimosas, the baobabs, and the tamarind-trees.\n \nSuch was the Sonray country, with its villages topped with roofs turned over\nlike Armenian caps. There were few mountains, and only such hills as were\nenough to form the ravines and pools where the pintadoes and snipes went\nsailing and diving through. Here and there, an impetuous torrent cut the roads,\nand had to be crossed by the natives on long vines stretched from tree to tree.\nThe forests gave place to jungles, which alligators, hippopotami, and the\nrhinoceros, made their haunts.\n \n\u201cIt will not be long before we see the Niger,\u201d said the doctor.\n\u201cThe face of the country always changes in the vicinity of large rivers.\nThese moving highways, as they are sometimes correctly called, have first\nbrought vegetation with them, as they will at last bring civilization. Thus, in\nits course of twenty-five hundred miles, the Niger has scattered along its\nbanks the most important cities of Africa.\u201d\n \n\u201cBy-the-way,\u201d put in Joe, \u201cthat reminds me of what was said\nby an admirer of the goodness of Providence, who praised the foresight with\nwhich it had generally caused rivers to flow close to large cities!\u201d\n \nAt noon the Victoria was passing over a petty town, a mere assemblage of\nmiserable huts, which once was Goa, a great capital.\n \n\u201cIt was there,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthat Barth crossed the\nNiger, on his return from Timbuctoo. This is the river so famous in antiquity,\nthe rival of the Nile, to which pagan superstition ascribed a celestial origin.\nLike the Nile, it has engaged the attention of geographers in all ages; and\nlike it, also, its exploration has cost the lives of many victims; yes, even\nmore of them than perished on account of the other.\u201d\n \nThe Niger flowed broadly between its banks, and its waters rolled southward\nwith some violence of current; but our travellers, borne swiftly by as they\nwere, could scarcely catch a glimpse of its curious outline.\n \n\u201cI wanted to talk to you about this river,\u201d said Dr. Ferguson,\n\u201cand it is already far from us. Under the names of Dhiouleba, Mayo,\nEgghirreou, Quorra, and other titles besides, it traverses an immense extent of\ncountry, and almost competes in length with the Nile. These appellations\nsignify simply \u2018the River,\u2019 according to the dialects of the\ncountries through which it passes.\u201d\n \n\u201cDid Dr. Barth follow this route?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cNo, Dick: in quitting Lake Tchad, he passed through the different towns\nof Bornou, and intersected the Niger at Say, four degrees below Goa; then he\npenetrated to the bosom of those unexplored countries which the Niger embraces\nin its elbow; and, after eight months of fresh fatigues, he arrived at\nTimbuctoo; all of which we may do in about three days with as swift a wind as\nthis.\u201d\n \n\u201cHave the sources of the Niger been discovered?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cLong since,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cThe exploration of the\nNiger and its tributaries was the object of several expeditions, the principal\nof which I shall mention: Between 1749 and 1758, Adamson made a reconnoissance\nof the river, and visited Gorea; from 1785 to 1788, Golberry and Geoffroy\ntravelled across the deserts of Senegambia, and ascended as far as the country\nof the Moors, who assassinated Saugnier, Brisson, Adam, Riley, Cochelet, and so\nmany other unfortunate men. Then came the illustrious Mungo Park, the friend of\nSir Walter Scott, and, like him, a Scotchman by birth. Sent out in 1795 by the\nAfrican Society of London, he got as far as Bambarra, saw the Niger, travelled\nfive hundred miles with a slave-merchant, reconnoitred the Gambia River, and\nreturned to England in 1797. He again set out, on the 30th of January, 1805,\nwith his brother-in-law Anderson, Scott, the designer, and a gang of workmen;\nhe reached Gorea, there added a detachment of thirty-five soldiers to his\nparty, and saw the Niger again on the 19th of August. But, by that time, in\nconsequence of fatigue, privations, ill-usage, the inclemencies of the weather,\nand the unhealthiness of the country, only eleven persons remained alive of the\nforty Europeans in the party. On the 16th of November, the last letters from\nMungo Park reached his wife; and, a year later a trader from that country gave\ninformation that, having got as far as Boussa, on the Niger, on the 23d of\nDecember, the unfortunate traveller\u2019s boat was upset by the cataracts in\nthat part of the river, and he was murdered by the natives.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd his dreadful fate did not check the efforts of others to explore\nthat river?\u201d\n \n\u201cOn the contrary, Dick. Since then, there were two objects in view:\nnamely, to recover the lost man\u2019s papers, as well as to pursue the\nexploration. In 1816, an expedition was organized, in which Major Grey took\npart. It arrived in Senegal, penetrated to the Fonta-Jallon, visited the\nFoullah and Mandingo populations, and returned to England without further\nresults. In 1822, Major Laing explored all the western part of Africa near to\nthe British possessions; and he it was who got so far as the sources of the\nNiger; and, according to his documents, the spring in which that immense river\ntakes its rise is not two feet broad.\n \n\u201cEasy to jump over,\u201d said Joe.\n \n\u201cHow\u2019s that? Easy you think, eh?\u201d retorted the doctor.\n\u201cIf we are to believe tradition, whoever attempts to pass that spring, by\nleaping over it, is immediately swallowed up; and whoever tries to draw water\nfrom it, feels himself repulsed by an invisible hand.\u201d\n \n\u201cI suppose a man has a right not to believe a word of that!\u201d\npersisted Joe.\n \n\u201cOh, by all means!\u2014Five years later, it was Major Laing\u2019s\ndestiny to force his way across the desert of Sahara, penetrate to Timbuctoo,\nand perish a few miles above it, by strangling, at the hands of the\nOuelad-shiman, who wanted to compel him to turn Mussulman.\u201d\n \n\u201cStill another victim!\u201d said the sportsman.\n \n\u201cIt was then that a brave young man, with his own feeble resources,\nundertook and accomplished the most astonishing of modern journeys\u2014I mean\nthe Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9, who, after sundry attempts in 1819 and 1824, set\nout again on the 19th of April, 1827, from Rio Nunez. On the 3d of August he\narrived at Tim\u00e9, so thoroughly exhausted and ill that he could not resume his\njourney until six months later, in January, 1828. He then joined a caravan,\nand, protected by his Oriental dress, reached the Niger on the 10th of March,\npenetrated to the city of Jenn\u00e9, embarked on the river, and descended it, as\nfar as Timbuctoo, where he arrived on the 30th of April. In 1760, another\nFrenchman, Imbert by name, and, in 1810, an Englishman, Robert Adams, had seen\nthis curious place; but Ren\u00e9 Cailli\u00e9 was to be the first European who could\nbring back any authentic data concerning it. On the 4th of May he quitted this\n\u2018Queen of the desert;\u2019 on the 9th, he surveyed the very spot where\nMajor Laing had been murdered; on the 19th, he arrived at El-Arouan, and left\nthat commercial town to brave a thousand dangers in crossing the vast solitudes\ncomprised between the Soudan and the northern regions of Africa. At length he\nentered Tangiers, and on the 28th of September sailed for Toulon. In nineteen\nmonths, notwithstanding one hundred and eighty days\u2019 sickness, he had\ntraversed Africa from west to north. Ah! had Cailli\u00e9 been born in England, he\nwould have been honored as the most intrepid traveller of modern times, as was\nthe case with Mungo Park. But in France he was not appreciated according to his\nworth.\u201d\n \n\u201cHe was a sturdy fellow!\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cbut what became of\nhim?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe died at the age of thirty-nine, from the consequences of his long\nfatigues. They thought they had done enough in decreeing him the prize of the\nGeographical Society in 1828; the highest honors would have been paid to him in\nEngland.\n \n\u201cWhile he was accomplishing this remarkable journey, an Englishman had\nconceived a similar enterprise and was trying to push it through with equal\ncourage, if not with equal good fortune. This was Captain Clapperton, the\ncompanion of Denham. In 1829 he reentered Africa by the western coast of the\nGulf of Benin; he then followed in the track of Mungo Park and of Laing,\nrecovered at Boussa the documents relative to the death of the former, and\narrived on the 20th of August at Sackatoo, where he was seized and held as a\nprisoner, until he expired in the arms of his faithful attendant Richard\nLander.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what became of this Lander?\u201d asked Joe, deeply interested.\n \n\u201cHe succeeded in regaining the coast and returned to London, bringing\nwith him the captain\u2019s papers, and an exact narrative of his own journey.\nHe then offered his services to the government to complete the reconnoissance\nof the Niger. He took with him his brother John, the second child of a poor\ncouple in Cornwall, and, together, these men, between 1829 and 1831,\nredescended the river from Boussa to its mouth, describing it village by\nvillage, mile by mile.\u201d\n \n\u201cSo both the brothers escaped the common fate?\u201d queried Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes, on this expedition, at least; but in 1833 Richard undertook a third\ntrip to the Niger, and perished by a bullet, near the mouth of the river. You\nsee, then, my friends, that the country over which we are now passing has\nwitnessed some noble instances of self-sacrifice which, unfortunately, have\nonly too often had death for their reward.\u201d\n",
        "\n\nThe Country in the Elbow of the Niger.\u2014A Fantastic View of the Hombori\nMountains.\u2014Kabra.\u2014Timbuctoo.\u2014The Chart of Dr. Barth.\u2014A\nDecaying City.\u2014Whither Heaven wills.\n \nDuring this dull Monday, Dr. Ferguson diverted his thoughts by giving his\ncompanions a thousand details concerning the country they were crossing. The\nsurface, which was quite flat, offered no impediment to their progress. The\ndoctor\u2019s sole anxiety arose from the obstinate northeast wind which\ncontinued to blow furiously, and bore them away from the latitude of Timbuctoo.\n \nThe Niger, after running northward as far as that city, sweeps around, like an\nimmense water-jet from some fountain, and falls into the Atlantic in a broad\nsheaf. In the elbow thus formed the country is of varied character, sometimes\nluxuriantly fertile, and sometimes extremely bare; fields of maize succeeded by\nwide spaces covered with broom-corn and uncultivated plains. All kinds of\naquatic birds\u2014pelicans, wild-duck, kingfishers, and the rest\u2014were\nseen in numerous flocks hovering about the borders of the pools and torrents.\n \nFrom time to time there appeared an encampment of Touaregs, the men sheltered\nunder their leather tents, while their women were busied with the domestic toil\noutside, milking their camels and smoking their huge-bowled pipes.\n \nBy eight o\u2019clock in the evening the Victoria had advanced more\nthan two hundred miles to the westward, and our a\u00ebronauts became the spectators\nof a magnificent scene.\n \nA mass of moonbeams forcing their way through an opening in the clouds, and\ngliding between the long lines of falling rain, descended in a golden shower on\nthe ridges of the Hombori Mountains. Nothing could be more weird than the\nappearance of these seemingly basaltic summits; they stood out in fantastic\nprofile against the sombre sky, and the beholder might have fancied them to be\nthe legendary ruins of some vast city of the middle ages, such as the icebergs\nof the polar seas sometimes mimic them in nights of gloom.\n \n\u201cAn admirable landscape for the \u2018Mysteries of\nUdolpho\u2019!\u201d exclaimed the doctor. \u201cAnn Radcliffe could not\nhave depicted yon mountains in a more appalling aspect.\u201d\n \n\u201cFaith!\u201d said Joe, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to be strolling\nalone in the evening through this country of ghosts. Do you see now, master, if\nit wasn\u2019t so heavy, I\u2019d like to carry that whole landscape home to\nScotland! It would do for the borders of Loch Lomond, and tourists would rush\nthere in crowds.\u201d\n \n\u201cOur balloon is hardly large enough to admit of that little\nexperiment\u2014but I think our direction is changing. Bravo!\u2014the elves\nand fairies of the place are quite obliging. See, they\u2019ve sent us a nice\nlittle southeast breeze, that will put us on the right track again.\u201d\n \nIn fact, the Victoria was resuming a more northerly route, and on the\nmorning of the 20th she was passing over an inextricable network of channels,\ntorrents, and streams, in fine, the whole complicated tangle of the\nNiger\u2019s tributaries. Many of these channels, covered with a thick growth\nof herbage, resembled luxuriant meadow-lands. There the doctor recognized the\nroute followed by the explorer Barth when he launched upon the river to descend\nto Timbuctoo. Eight hundred fathoms broad at this point, the Niger flowed\nbetween banks richly grown with cruciferous plants and tamarind-trees. Herds of\nagile gazelles were seen skipping about, their curling horns mingling with the\ntall herbage, within which the alligator, half concealed, lay silently in wait\nfor them with watchful eyes.\n \nLong files of camels and asses laden with merchandise from Jenn\u00e9 were winding\nin under the noble trees. Ere long, an amphitheatre of low-built houses was\ndiscovered at a turn of the river, their roofs and terraces heaped up with hay\nand straw gathered from the neighboring districts.\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s Kabra!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, joyously; \u201cthere\nis the harbor of Timbuctoo, and the city is not five miles from here!\u201d\n \n\u201cThen, sir, you are satisfied?\u201d half queried Joe.\n \n\u201cDelighted, my boy!\u201d\n \n\u201cVery good; then every thing\u2019s for the best!\u201d\n \nIn fact, about two o\u2019clock, the Queen of the Desert, mysterious\nTimbuctoo, which once, like Athens and Rome, had her schools of learned men,\nand her professorships of philosophy, stretched away before the gaze of our\ntravellers.\n \nFerguson followed the most minute details upon the chart traced by Barth\nhimself, and was enabled to recognize its perfect accuracy.\n \nThe city forms an immense triangle marked out upon a vast plain of white sand,\nits acute angle directed toward the north and piercing a corner of the desert.\nIn the environs there was almost nothing, hardly even a few grasses, with some\ndwarf mimosas and stunted bushes.\n \nAs for the appearance of Timbuctoo, the reader has but to imagine a collection\nof billiard-balls and thimbles\u2014such is the bird\u2019s-eye view! The\nstreets, which are quite narrow, are lined with houses only one story in\nheight, built of bricks dried in the sun, and huts of straw and reeds, the\nformer square, the latter conical. Upon the terraces were seen some of the male\ninhabitants, carelessly lounging at full length in flowing apparel of bright\ncolors, and lance or musket in hand; but no women were visible at that hour of\nthe day.\n \n\u201cYet they are said to be handsome,\u201d remarked the doctor. \u201cYou\nsee the three towers of the three mosques that are the only ones left standing\nof a great number\u2014the city has indeed fallen from its ancient splendor!\nAt the top of the triangle rises the Mosque of Sankore, with its ranges of\ngalleries resting on arcades of sufficiently pure design. Farther on, and near\nto the Sane-Gungu quarter, is the Mosque of Sidi-Yahia and some two-story\nhouses. But do not look for either palaces or monuments: the sheik is a mere\nson of traffic, and his royal palace is a counting-house.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt seems to me that I can see half-ruined ramparts,\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cThey were destroyed by the Fouillanes in 1826; the city was one-third\nlarger then, for Timbuctoo, an object generally coveted by all the tribes,\nsince the eleventh century, has belonged in succession to the Touaregs, the\nSonrayans, the Morocco men, and the Fouillanes; and this great centre of\ncivilization, where a sage like Ahmed-Baba owned, in the sixteenth century, a\nlibrary of sixteen hundred manuscripts, is now nothing but a mere half-way\nhouse for the trade of Central Africa.\u201d\n \nThe city, indeed, seemed abandoned to supreme neglect; it betrayed that\nindifference which seems epidemic to cities that are passing away. Huge heaps\nof rubbish encumbered the suburbs, and, with the hill on which the market-place\nstood, formed the only inequalities of the ground.\n \nWhen the Victoria passed, there was some slight show of movement; drums\nwere beaten; but the last learned man still lingering in the place had hardly\ntime to notice the new phenomenon, for our travellers, driven onward by the\nwind of the desert, resumed the winding course of the river, and, ere long,\nTimbuctoo was nothing more than one of the fleeting reminiscences of their\njourney.\n \n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cHeaven may waft us whither it\npleases!\u201d\n \n\u201cProvided only that we go westward,\u201d added Kennedy.\n \n\u201cBah!\u201d said Joe; \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be afraid if it was to go\nback to Zanzibar by the same road, or to cross the ocean to America.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe would first have to be able to do that, Joe!\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd what\u2019s wanting, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cGas, my boy; the ascending force of the balloon is evidently growing\nweaker, and we shall need all our management to make it carry us to the\nsea-coast. I shall even have to throw over some ballast. We are too\nheavy.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what comes of doing nothing, doctor; when a man lies\nstretched out all day long in his hammock, he gets fat and heavy. It\u2019s a\nlazybones trip, this of ours, master, and when we get back every body will find\nus big and stout.\u201d\n \n\u201cJust like Joe,\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cjust the ideas for him: but\nwait a bit! Can you tell what we may have to go through yet? We are still far\nfrom the end of our trip. Where do you expect to strike the African coast,\ndoctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cI should find it hard to answer you, Kennedy. We are at the mercy of\nvery variable winds; but I should think myself fortunate were we to strike it\nbetween Sierra Leone and Portendick. There is a stretch of country in that\nquarter where we should meet with friends.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd it would be a pleasure to press their hands; but, are we going in\nthe desirable direction?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot any too well, Dick; not any too well! Look at the needle of the\ncompass; we are bearing southward, and ascending the Niger toward its\nsources.\u201d\n \n\u201cA fine chance to discover them,\u201d said Joe, \u201cif they were not\nknown already. Now, couldn\u2019t we just find others for it, on a\npinch?\u201d\n \n\u201cNot exactly, Joe; but don\u2019t be alarmed: I hardly expect to go so\nfar as that.\u201d\n \nAt nightfall the doctor threw out the last bags of sand. The Victoria\nrose higher, and the blow-pipe, although working at full blast, could scarcely\nkeep her up. At that time she was sixty miles to the southward of Timbuctoo,\nand in the morning the a\u00ebronauts awoke over the banks of the Niger, not far\nfrom Lake Debo.\n",
        "\n\nDr. Ferguson\u2019s Anxieties.\u2014Persistent Movement southward.\u2014A\nCloud of Grasshoppers.\u2014A View of Jenn\u00e9.\u2014A View of\nS\u00e9go.\u2014Change of the Wind.\u2014Joe\u2019s Regrets.\n \nThe flow of the river was, at that point, divided by large islands into narrow\nbranches, with a very rapid current. Upon one among them stood some\nshepherds\u2019 huts, but it had become impossible to take an exact\nobservation of them, because the speed of the balloon was constantly\nincreasing. Unfortunately, it turned still more toward the south, and in a few\nmoments crossed Lake Debo.\n \nDr. Ferguson, forcing the dilation of his a\u00ebrial craft to the utmost, sought\nfor other currents of air at different heights, but in vain; and he soon gave\nup the attempt, which was only augmenting the waste of gas by pressing it\nagainst the well-worn tissue of the balloon.\n \nHe made no remark, but he began to feel very anxious. This persistence of the\nwind to head him off toward the southern part of Africa was defeating his\ncalculations, and he no longer knew upon whom or upon what to depend. Should he\nnot reach the English or French territories, what was to become of him in the\nmidst of the barbarous tribes that infest the coasts of Guinea? How should he\nthere get to a ship to take him back to England? And the actual direction of\nthe wind was driving him along to the kingdom of Dahomey, among the most savage\nraces, and into the power of a ruler who was in the habit of sacrificing\nthousands of human victims at his public orgies. There he would be lost!\n \nOn the other hand, the balloon was visibly wearing out, and the doctor felt it\nfailing him. However, as the weather was clearing up a little, he hoped that\nthe cessation of the rain would bring about a change in the atmospheric\ncurrents.\n \nIt was therefore a disagreeable reminder of the actual situation when Joe said\naloud:\n \n\u201cThere! the rain\u2019s going to pour down harder than ever; and this\ntime it will be the deluge itself, if we\u2019re to judge by yon cloud\nthat\u2019s coming up!\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! another cloud?\u201d asked Ferguson.\n \n\u201cYes, and a famous one,\u201d replied Kennedy.\n \n\u201cI never saw the like of it,\u201d added Joe.\n \n\u201cI breathe freely again!\u201d said the doctor, laying down his\nspy-glass. \u201cThat\u2019s not a cloud!\u201d\n \n\u201cNot a cloud?\u201d queried Joe, with surprise.\n \n\u201cNo; it is a swarm.\u201d\n \n\u201cEh?\u201d\n \n\u201cA swarm of grasshoppers!\u201d\n \n\u201cThat? Grasshoppers!\u201d\n \n\u201cMyriads of grasshoppers, that are going to sweep over this country like\na water-spout; and woe to it! for, should these insects alight, it will be laid\nwaste.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat would be a sight worth beholding!\u201d\n \n\u201cWait a little, Joe. In ten minutes that cloud will have arrived where we\nare, and you can then judge by the aid of your own eyes.\u201d\n \nThe doctor was right. The cloud, thick, opaque, and several miles in extent,\ncame on with a deafening noise, casting its immense shadow over the fields. It\nwas composed of numberless legions of that species of grasshopper called\ncrickets. About a hundred paces from the balloon, they settled down upon a\ntract full of foliage and verdure. Fifteen minutes later, the mass resumed its\nflight, and our travellers could, even at a distance, see the trees and the\nbushes entirely stripped, and the fields as bare as though they had been swept\nwith the scythe. One would have thought that a sudden winter had just descended\nupon the earth and struck the region with the most complete sterility.\n \n\u201cWell, Joe, what do you think of that?\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, doctor, it\u2019s very curious, but quite natural. What one\ngrasshopper does on a small scale, thousands do on a grand scale.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible shower,\u201d said the hunter; \u201cmore so\nthan hail itself in the devastation it causes.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is impossible to prevent it,\u201d replied Ferguson.\n\u201cSometimes the inhabitants have had the idea to burn the forests, and\neven the standing crops, in order to arrest the progress of these insects; but\nthe first ranks plunging into the flames would extinguish them beneath their\nmass, and the rest of the swarm would then pass irresistibly onward.\nFortunately, in these regions, there is some sort of compensation for their\nravages, since the natives gather these insects in great numbers and greedily\neat them.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey are the prawns of the air,\u201d said Joe, who added that he was\nsorry that he had never had the chance to taste them\u2014just for\ninformation\u2019s sake!\n \nThe country became more marshy toward evening; the forests dwindled to isolated\nclumps of trees; and on the borders of the river could be seen plantations of\ntobacco, and swampy meadow-lands fat with forage. At last the city of Jenn\u00e9, on\na large island, came in sight, with the two towers of its clay-built mosque,\nand the putrid odor of the millions of swallows\u2019 nests accumulated in its\nwalls. The tops of some baobabs, mimosas, and date-trees peeped up between the\nhouses; and, even at night, the activity of the place seemed very great. Jenn\u00e9\nis, in fact, quite a commercial city: it supplies all the wants of Timbuctoo.\nIts boats on the river, and its caravans along the shaded roads, bear thither\nthe various products of its industry.\n \n\u201cWere it not that to do so would prolong our journey,\u201d said the\ndoctor, \u201cI should like to alight at this place. There must be more than\none Arab there who has travelled in England and France, and to whom our style\nof locomotion is not altogether new. But it would not be prudent.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us put off the visit until our next trip,\u201d said Joe, laughing.\n \n\u201cBesides, my friends, unless I am mistaken, the wind has a slight\ntendency to veer a little more to the eastward, and we must not lose such an\nopportunity.\u201d\n \nThe doctor threw overboard some articles that were no longer of use\u2014some\nempty bottles, and a case that had contained preserved-meat\u2014and thereby\nmanaged to keep the balloon in a belt of the atmosphere more favorable to his\nplans. At four o\u2019clock in the morning the first rays of the sun lighted\nup S\u00e9go, the capital of Bambarra, which could be recognized at once by the four\ntowns that compose it, by its Saracenic mosques, and by the incessant going and\ncoming of the flat-bottomed boats that convey its inhabitants from one quarter\nto the other. But the travellers were not more seen than they saw. They sped\nrapidly and directly to the northwest, and the doctor\u2019s anxiety gradually\nsubsided.\n \n\u201cTwo more days in this direction, and at this rate of speed, and\nwe\u2019ll reach the Senegal River.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll be in a friendly country?\u201d asked the hunter.\n \n\u201cNot altogether; but, if the worst came to the worst, and the balloon\nwere to fail us, we might make our way to the French settlements. But, let it\nhold out only for a few hundred miles, and we shall arrive without fatigue,\nalarm, or danger, at the western coast.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd the thing will be over!\u201d added Joe. \u201cHeigh-ho! so much\nthe worse. If it wasn\u2019t for the pleasure of telling about it, I would\nnever want to set foot on the ground again! Do you think anybody will believe\nour story, doctor?\u201d\n \n\u201cWho can tell, Joe? One thing, however, will be undeniable: a thousand\nwitnesses saw us start on one side of the African Continent, and a thousand\nmore will see us arrive on the other.\u201d\n \n\u201cAnd, in that case, it seems to me that it would be hard to say that we\nhad not crossed it,\u201d added Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAh, doctor!\u201d said Joe again, with a deep sigh, \u201cI\u2019ll\nthink more than once of my lumps of solid gold-ore! There was something that\nwould have given weight to our narrative! At a grain of gold per head, I\ncould have got together a nice crowd to listen to me, and even to admire\nme!\u201d\n",
        "\n\nThe Approaches to Senegal.\u2014The Balloon sinks lower and lower.\u2014They\nkeep throwing out, throwing out.\u2014The Marabout Al-Hadji.\u2014Messrs.\nPascal, Vincent, and Lambert.\u2014A Rival of Mohammed.\u2014The Difficult\nMountains.\u2014Kennedy\u2019s Weapons.\u2014One of Joe\u2019s\nMan\u0153uvres.\u2014A Halt over a Forest.\n \nOn the 27th of May, at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, the country presented\nan entirely different aspect. The slopes, extending far away, changed to hills\nthat gave evidence of mountains soon to follow. They would have to cross the\nchain which separates the basin of the Niger from the basin of the Senegal, and\ndetermines the course of the water-shed, whether to the Gulf of Guinea on the\none hand, or to the bay of Cape Verde on the other.\n \nAs far as Senegal, this part of Africa is marked down as dangerous. Dr.\nFerguson knew it through the recitals of his predecessors. They had suffered a\nthousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in the midst of\nthese barbarous negro tribes. It was this fatal climate that had devoured most\nof the companions of Mungo Park. Ferguson, therefore, was more than ever\ndecided not to set foot in this inhospitable region.\n \nBut he had not enjoyed one moment of repose. The Victoria was descending\nvery perceptibly, so much so that he had to throw overboard a number more of\nuseless articles, especially when there was a mountain-top to pass. Things went\non thus for more than one hundred and twenty miles; they were worn out with\nascending and falling again; the balloon, like another rock of Sisyphus, kept\ncontinually sinking back toward the ground. The rotundity of the covering,\nwhich was now but little inflated, was collapsing already. It assumed an\nelongated shape, and the wind hollowed large cavities in the silken surface.\n \nKennedy could not help observing this.\n \n\u201cIs there a crack or a tear in the balloon?\u201d he asked.\n \n\u201cNo, but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat,\nand the hydrogen is escaping through the silk.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow can we prevent that?\u201d\n \n\u201cIt is impossible. Let us lighten her. That is the only help. So let us\nthrow out every thing we can spare.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut what shall it be?\u201d said the hunter, looking at the car, which\nwas already quite bare.\n \n\u201cWell, let us get rid of the awning, for its weight is quite\nconsiderable.\u201d\n \nJoe, who was interested in this order, climbed up on the circle which kept\ntogether the cordage of the network, and from that place easily managed to\ndetach the heavy curtains of the awning and throw them overboard.\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s something that will gladden the hearts of a whole tribe of\nblacks,\u201d said he; \u201cthere\u2019s enough to dress a thousand of\nthem, for they\u2019re not very extravagant with cloth.\u201d\n \nThe balloon had risen a little, but it soon became evident that it was again\napproaching the ground.\n \n\u201cLet us alight,\u201d suggested Kennedy, \u201cand see what can be done\nwith the covering of the balloon.\u201d\n \n\u201cI tell you, again, Dick, that we have no means of repairing it.\u201d\n \n\u201cThen what shall we do?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to sacrifice every thing not absolutely indispensable;\nI am anxious, at all hazards, to avoid a detention in these regions. The\nforests over the tops of which we are skimming are any thing but safe.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat! are there lions in them, or hyenas?\u201d asked Joe, with an\nexpression of sovereign contempt.\n \n\u201cWorse than that, my boy! There are men, and some of the most cruel, too,\nin all Africa.\u201d\n \n\u201cHow is that known?\u201d\n \n\u201cBy the statements of travellers who have been here before us. Then the\nFrench settlers, who occupy the colony of Senegal, necessarily have relations\nwith the surrounding tribes. Under the administration of Colonel Faidherbe,\nreconnaissances have been pushed far up into the country. Officers such as\nMessrs. Pascal, Vincent, and Lambert, have brought back precious documents from\ntheir expeditions. They have explored these countries formed by the elbow of\nthe Senegal in places where war and pillage have left nothing but ruins.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat, then, took place?\u201d\n \n\u201cI will tell you. In 1854 a Marabout of the Senegalese Fouta, Al-Hadji by\nname, declaring himself to be inspired like Mohammed, stirred up all the tribes\nto war against the infidels\u2014that is to say, against the Europeans. He\ncarried destruction and desolation over the regions between the Senegal River\nand its tributary, the Fat\u00e9m\u00e9. Three hordes of fanatics led on by him scoured\nthe country, sparing neither a village nor a hut in their pillaging, massacring\ncareer. He advanced in person on the town of S\u00e9go, which was a long time\nthreatened. In 1857 he worked up farther to the northward, and invested the\nfortification of Medina, built by the French on the bank of the river. This\nstronghold was defended by Paul Holl, who, for several months, without\nprovisions or ammunition, held out until Colonel Faidherbe came to his relief.\nAl-Hadji and his bands then repassed the Senegal, and reappeared in the Kaarta,\ncontinuing their rapine and murder.\u2014Well, here below us is the very\ncountry in which he has found refuge with his hordes of banditti; and I assure\nyou that it would not be a good thing to fall into his hands.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall not,\u201d said Joe, \u201ceven if we have to throw overboard\nour clothes to save the Victoria.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are not far from the river,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cbut I\nforesee that our balloon will not be able to carry us beyond it.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet us reach its banks, at all events,\u201d said the Scot, \u201cand\nthat will be so much gained.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is what we are trying to do,\u201d rejoined Ferguson, \u201conly\nthat one thing makes me feel anxious.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n \n\u201cWe shall have mountains to pass, and that will be difficult to do, since\nI cannot augment the ascensional force of the balloon, even with the greatest\npossible heat that I can produce.\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, wait a bit,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cand we shall see!\u201d\n \n\u201cThe poor Victoria!\u201d sighed Joe; \u201cI had got fond of\nher as the sailor does of his ship, and I\u2019ll not give her up so easily.\nShe may not be what she was at the start\u2014granted; but we shouldn\u2019t\nsay a word against her. She has done us good service, and it would break my\nheart to desert her.\u201d\n \n\u201cBe at your ease, Joe; if we leave her, it will be in spite of ourselves.\nShe\u2019ll serve us until she\u2019s completely worn out, and I ask of her\nonly twenty-four hours more!\u201d\n \n\u201cAh, she\u2019s getting used up! She grows thinner and thinner,\u201d\nsaid Joe, dolefully, while he eyed her. \u201cPoor balloon!\u201d\n \n\u201cUnless I am deceived,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cthere on the horizon\nare the mountains of which you were speaking, doctor.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, there they are, indeed!\u201d exclaimed the doctor, after having\nexamined them through his spy-glass, \u201cand they look very high. We shall\nhave some trouble in crossing them.\u201d\n \n\u201cCan we not avoid them?\u201d\n \n\u201cI am afraid not, Dick. See what an immense space they\noccupy\u2014nearly one-half of the horizon!\u201d\n \n\u201cThey even seem to shut us in,\u201d added Joe. \u201cThey are gaining\non both our right and our left.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe must then pass over them.\u201d\n \nThese obstacles, which threatened such imminent peril, seemed to approach with\nextreme rapidity, or, to speak more accurately, the wind, which was very fresh,\nwas hurrying the balloon toward the sharp peaks. So rise it must, or be dashed\nto pieces.\n \n\u201cLet us empty our tank of water,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand keep\nonly enough for one day.\u201d\n \n\u201cThere it goes,\u201d shouted Joe.\n \n\u201cDoes the balloon rise at all?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cA little\u2014some fifty feet,\u201d replied the doctor, who kept his\neyes fixed on the barometer. \u201cBut that is not enough.\u201d\n \nIn truth the lofty peaks were starting up so swiftly before the travellers that\nthey seemed to be rushing down upon them. The balloon was far from rising above\nthem. She lacked an elevation of more than five hundred feet more.\n \nThe stock of water for the cylinder was also thrown overboard and only a few\npints were retained, but still all this was not enough.\n \n\u201cWe must pass them though!\u201d urged the doctor.\n \n\u201cLet us throw out the tanks\u2014we have emptied them.\u201d said\nKennedy.\n \n\u201cOver with them!\u201d\n \n\u201cThere they go!\u201d panted Joe. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to see\nourselves dropping off this way by piecemeal.\u201d\n \n\u201cNow, for your part, Joe, make no attempt to sacrifice yourself as you\ndid the other day! Whatever happens, swear to me that you will not leave\nus!\u201d\n \n\u201cHave no fears, my master, we shall not be separated.\u201d\n \nThe Victoria had ascended some hundred and twenty feet, but the crest of\nthe mountain still towered above it. It was an almost perpendicular ridge that\nended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line. It still rose more\nthan two hundred feet over the a\u00ebronauts.\n \n\u201cIn ten minutes,\u201d said the doctor to himself, \u201cour car will\nbe dashed against those rocks unless we succeed in passing them!\u201d\n \n\u201cWell, doctor?\u201d queried Joe.\n \n\u201cKeep nothing but our pemmican, and throw out all the heavy meat.\u201d\n \nThereupon the balloon was again lightened by some fifty pounds, and it rose\nvery perceptibly, but that was of little consequence, unless it got above the\nline of the mountain-tops. The situation was terrifying. The Victoria\nwas rushing on with great rapidity. They could feel that she would be dashed to\npieces\u2014that the shock would be fearful.\n \nThe doctor glanced around him in the car. It was nearly empty.\n \n\u201cIf needs be, Dick, hold yourself in readiness to throw over your\nfire-arms!\u201d\n \n\u201cSacrifice my fire-arms?\u201d repeated the sportsman, with intense\nfeeling.\n \n\u201cMy friend, I ask it; it will be absolutely necessary!\u201d\n \n\u201cSamuel! Doctor!\u201d\n \n\u201cYour guns, and your stock of powder and ball might cost us our\nlives.\u201d\n \n\u201cWe are close to it!\u201d cried Joe.\n \nSixty feet! The mountain still overtopped the balloon by sixty feet.\n \nJoe took the blankets and other coverings and tossed them out; then, without a\nword to Kennedy, he threw over several bags of bullets and lead.\n \nThe balloon went up still higher; it surmounted the dangerous ridge, and the\nrays of the sun shone upon its uppermost extremity; but the car was still below\nthe level of certain broken masses of rock, against which it would inevitably\nbe dashed.\n \n\u201cKennedy! Kennedy! throw out your fire-arms, or we are lost!\u201d\nshouted the doctor.\n \n\u201cWait, sir; wait one moment!\u201d they heard Joe exclaim, and, looking\naround, they saw Joe disappear over the edge of the balloon.\n \n\u201cJoe! Joe!\u201d cried Kennedy.\n \n\u201cWretched man!\u201d was the doctor\u2019s agonized expression.\n \nThe flat top of the mountain may have had about twenty feet in breadth at this\npoint, and, on the other side, the slope presented a less declivity. The car\njust touched the level of this plane, which happened to be quite even, and it\nglided over a soil composed of sharp pebbles that grated as it passed.\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re over it! we\u2019re over it! we\u2019re clear!\u201d\ncried out an exulting voice that made Ferguson\u2019s heart leap to his\nthroat.\n \nThe daring fellow was there, grasping the lower rim of the car, and running\nafoot over the top of the mountain, thus lightening the balloon of his whole\nweight. He had to hold on with all his strength, too, for it was likely to\nescape his grasp at any moment.\n \nWhen he had reached the opposite declivity, and the abyss was before him, Joe,\nby a vigorous effort, hoisted himself from the ground, and, clambering up by\nthe cordage, rejoined his friends.\n \n\u201cThat was all!\u201d he coolly ejaculated.\n \n\u201cMy brave Joe! my friend!\u201d said the doctor, with deep emotion.\n \n\u201cOh! what I did,\u201d laughed the other, \u201cwas not for you; it was\nto save Mr. Kennedy\u2019s rifle. I owed him that good turn for the affair\nwith the Arab! I like to pay my debts, and now we are even,\u201d added he,\nhanding to the sportsman his favorite weapon. \u201cI\u2019d feel very badly\nto see you deprived of it.\u201d\n \nKennedy heartily shook the brave fellow\u2019s hand, without being able to\nutter a word.\n \nThe Victoria had nothing to do now but to descend. That was easy enough,\nso that she was soon at a height of only two hundred feet from the ground, and\nwas then in equilibrium. The surface seemed very much broken as though by a\nconvulsion of nature. It presented numerous inequalities, which would have been\nvery difficult to avoid during the night with a balloon that could no longer be\ncontrolled. Evening was coming on rapidly, and, notwithstanding his repugnance,\nthe doctor had to make up his mind to halt until morning.\n \n\u201cWe\u2019ll now look for a favorable stopping-place,\u201d said he.\n \n\u201cAh!\u201d replied Kennedy, \u201cyou have made up your mind, then, at\nlast?\u201d\n \n\u201cYes, I have for a long time been thinking over a plan which we\u2019ll\ntry to put into execution; it is only six o\u2019clock in the evening, and we\nshall have time enough. Throw out your anchors, Joe!\u201d\n \nJoe immediately obeyed, and the two anchors dangled below the balloon.\n \n\u201cI see large forests ahead of us,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwe are\ngoing to sweep along their tops, and we shall grapple to some tree, for nothing\nwould make me think of passing the night below, on the ground.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut can we not descend?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cTo what purpose? I repeat that it would be dangerous for us to separate,\nand, besides, I claim your help for a difficult piece of work.\u201d\n \nThe Victoria, which was skimming along the tops of immense forests, soon\ncame to a sharp halt. Her anchors had caught, and, the wind falling as dusk\ncame on, she remained motionlessly suspended above a vast field of verdure,\nformed by the tops of a forest of sycamores.\n",
        "\n\nA Struggle of Generosity.\u2014The Last Sacrifice.\u2014The Dilating\nApparatus.\u2014Joe\u2019s Adroitness.\u2014Midnight.\u2014The\nDoctor\u2019s Watch.\u2014Kennedy\u2019s Watch.\u2014The Latter falls\nasleep at his Post.\u2014The Fire.\u2014The Howlings of the\nNatives.\u2014Out of Range.\n \nDoctor Ferguson\u2019s first care was to take his bearings by stellar\nobservation, and he discovered that he was scarcely twenty-five miles from\nSenegal.\n \n\u201cAll that we can manage to do, my friends,\u201d said he, after having\npointed his map, \u201cis to cross the river; but, as there is neither bridge\nnor boat, we must, at all hazards, cross it with the balloon, and, in order to\ndo that, we must still lighten up.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut I don\u2019t exactly see how we can do that?\u201d replied\nKennedy, anxious about his fire-arms, \u201cunless one of us makes up his mind\nto sacrifice himself for the rest,\u2014that is, to stay behind, and, in my\nturn, I claim that honor.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou, indeed!\u201d remonstrated Joe; \u201cain\u2019t I used\nto\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cThe question now is, not to throw ourselves out of the car, but simply\nto reach the coast of Africa on foot. I am a first-rate walker, a good\nsportsman, and\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019ll never consent to it!\u201d insisted Joe.\n \n\u201cYour generous rivalry is useless, my brave friends,\u201d said\nFerguson; \u201cI trust that we shall not come to any such extremity: besides,\nif we did, instead of separating, we should keep together, so as to make our\nway across the country in company.\u201d\n \n\u201cThat\u2019s the talk,\u201d said Joe; \u201ca little tramp\nwon\u2019t do us any harm.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut before we try that,\u201d resumed the doctor, \u201cwe must employ\na last means of lightening the balloon.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat will that be? I should like to see it,\u201d said Kennedy,\nincredulously.\n \n\u201cWe must get rid of the cylinder-chests, the spiral, and the Buntzen\nbattery. Nine hundred pounds make a rather heavy load to carry through the\nair.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut then, Samuel, how will you dilate your gas?\u201d\n \n\u201cI shall not do so at all. We\u2019ll have to get along without\nit.\u201d\n \n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \n\u201cListen, my friends: I have calculated very exactly the amount of\nascensional force left to us, and it is sufficient to carry us every one with\nthe few objects that remain. We shall make in all a weight of hardly five\nhundred pounds, including the two anchors which I desire to keep.\u201d\n \n\u201cDear doctor, you know more about the matter than we do; you are the sole\njudge of the situation. Tell us what we ought to do, and we will do it.\u201d\n \n\u201cI am at your orders, master,\u201d added Joe.\n \n\u201cI repeat, my friends, that however serious the decision may appear, we\nmust sacrifice our apparatus.\u201d\n \n\u201cLet it go, then!\u201d said Kennedy, promptly.\n \n\u201cTo work!\u201d said Joe.\n \nIt was no easy job. The apparatus had to be taken down piece by piece. First,\nthey took out the mixing reservoir, then the one belonging to the cylinder, and\nlastly the tank in which the decomposition of the water was effected. The\nunited strength of all three travellers was required to detach these reservoirs\nfrom the bottom of the car in which they had been so firmly secured; but\nKennedy was so strong, Joe so adroit, and the doctor so ingenious, that they\nfinally succeeded. The different pieces were thrown out, one after the other,\nand they disappeared below, making huge gaps in the foliage of the sycamores.\n \n\u201cThe black fellows will be mightily astonished,\u201d said Joe,\n\u201cat finding things like those in the woods; they\u2019ll make idols of\nthem!\u201d\n \nThe next thing to be looked after was the displacement of the pipes that were\nfastened in the balloon and connected with the spiral. Joe succeeded in cutting\nthe caoutchouc jointings above the car, but when he came to the pipes he found\nit more difficult to disengage them, because they were held by their upper\nextremity and fastened by wires to the very circlet of the valve.\n \nThen it was that Joe showed wonderful adroitness. In his naked feet, so as not\nto scratch the covering, he succeeded by the aid of the network, and in spite\nof the oscillations of the balloon, in climbing to the upper extremity, and\nafter a thousand difficulties, in holding on with one hand to that slippery\nsurface, while he detached the outside screws that secured the pipes in their\nplace. These were then easily taken out, and drawn away by the lower end, which\nwas hermetically sealed by means of a strong ligature.\n \nThe Victoria, relieved of this considerable weight, rose upright in the\nair and tugged strongly at the anchor-rope.\n \nAbout midnight this work ended without accident, but at the cost of most severe\nexertion, and the trio partook of a luncheon of pemmican and cold punch, as the\ndoctor had no more fire to place at Joe\u2019s disposal.\n \nBesides, the latter and Kennedy were dropping off their feet with fatigue.\n \n\u201cLie down, my friends, and get some rest,\u201d said the doctor.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the first watch; at two o\u2019clock I\u2019ll waken\nKennedy; at four, Kennedy will waken Joe, and at six we\u2019ll start; and may\nHeaven have us in its keeping for this last day of the trip!\u201d\n \nWithout waiting to be coaxed, the doctor\u2019s two companions stretched\nthemselves at the bottom of the car and dropped into profound slumber on the\ninstant.\n \nThe night was calm. A few clouds broke against the last quarter of the moon,\nwhose uncertain rays scarcely pierced the darkness. Ferguson, resting his\nelbows on the rim of the car, gazed attentively around him. He watched with\nclose attention the dark screen of foliage that spread beneath him, hiding the\nground from his view. The least noise aroused his suspicions, and he questioned\neven the slightest rustling of the leaves.\n \nHe was in that mood which solitude makes more keenly felt, and during which\nvague terrors mount to the brain. At the close of such a journey, after having\nsurmounted so many obstacles, and at the moment of touching the goal,\none\u2019s fears are more vivid, one\u2019s emotions keener. The point of\narrival seems to fly farther from our gaze.\n \nMoreover, the present situation had nothing very consolatory about it. They\nwere in the midst of a barbarous country, and dependent upon a vehicle that\nmight fail them at any moment. The doctor no longer counted implicitly on his\nballoon; the time had gone by when he manoevred it boldly because he felt sure\nof it.\n \nUnder the influence of these impressions, the doctor, from time to time,\nthought that he heard vague sounds in the vast forests around him; he even\nfancied that he saw a swift gleam of fire shining between the trees. He looked\nsharply and turned his night-glass toward the spot; but there was nothing to be\nseen, and the profoundest silence appeared to return.\n \nHe had, no doubt, been under the dominion of a mere hallucination. He continued\nto listen, but without hearing the slightest noise. When his watch had expired,\nhe woke Kennedy, and, enjoining upon him to observe the extremest vigilance,\ntook his place beside Joe, and fell sound asleep.\n \nKennedy, while still rubbing his eyes, which he could scarcely keep open,\ncalmly lit his pipe. He then ensconced himself in a corner, and began to smoke\nvigorously by way of keeping awake.\n \nThe most absolute silence reigned around him; a light wind shook the tree-tops\nand gently rocked the car, inviting the hunter to taste the sleep that stole\nover him in spite of himself. He strove hard to resist it, and repeatedly\nopened his eyes to plunge into the outer darkness one of those looks that see\nnothing; but at last, yielding to fatigue, he sank back and slumbered.\n \nHow long he had been buried in this stupor he knew not, but he was suddenly\naroused from it by a strange, unexpected crackling sound.\n \nHe rubbed his eyes and sprang to his feet. An intense glare half-blinded him\nand heated his cheek\u2014the forest was in flames!\n \n\u201cFire! fire!\u201d he shouted, scarcely comprehending what had happened.\n \nHis two companions started up in alarm.\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d was the doctor\u2019s immediate\nexclamation.\n \n\u201cFire!\u201d said Joe. \u201cBut who could\u2014\u201d\n \nAt this moment loud yells were heard under the foliage, which was now\nilluminated as brightly as the day.\n \n\u201cAh! the savages!\u201d cried Joe again; \u201cthey have set fire to\nthe forest so as to be the more certain of burning us up.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe Talabas! Al-Hadji\u2019s marabouts, no doubt,\u201d said the\ndoctor.\n \nA circle of fire hemmed the Victoria in; the crackling of the dry wood\nmingled with the hissing and sputtering of the green branches; the clambering\nvines, the foliage, all the living part of this vegetation, writhed in the\ndestructive element. The eye took in nothing but one vast ocean of flame; the\nlarge trees stood forth in black relief in this huge furnace, their branches\ncovered with glowing coals, while the whole blazing mass, the entire\nconflagration, was reflected on the clouds, and the travellers could fancy\nthemselves enveloped in a hollow globe of fire.\n \n\u201cLet us escape to the ground!\u201d shouted Kennedy, \u201cit is our\nonly chance of safety!\u201d\n \nBut Ferguson checked him with a firm grasp, and, dashing at the anchor-rope,\nsevered it with one well-directed blow of his hatchet. Meanwhile, the flames,\nleaping up at the balloon, already quivered on its illuminated sides; but the\nVictoria, released from her fastenings, spun upward a thousand feet into\nthe air.\n \nFrightful yells resounded through the forest, along with the report of\nfire-arms, while the balloon, caught in a current of air that rose with the\ndawn of day, was borne to the westward.\n \nIt was now four o\u2019clock in the morning.\n",

Look!\u201d\n \nThey had just passed the borders of the forest, and the three friends could see\nsome thirty mounted men clad in broad pantaloons and the floating bournouses.\nThey were armed, some with lances, and others with long muskets, and they were\nfollowing, on their quick, fiery little steeds, the direction of the balloon,\nwhich was moving at only moderate speed.\n \nWhen they caught sight of the a\u00ebronauts, they uttered savage cries, and\nbrandished their weapons. Anger and menace could be read upon their swarthy\nfaces, made more ferocious by thin but bristling beards. Meanwhile they\ngalloped along without difficulty over the low levels and gentle declivities\nthat lead down to the Senegal.\n \n\u201cIt is, indeed, they!\u201d said the doctor; \u201cthe cruel Talabas!\nthe ferocious marabouts of Al-Hadji! I would rather find myself in the middle\nof the forest encircled by wild beasts than fall into the hands of these\nbanditti.\u201d\n \n\u201cThey haven\u2019t a very obliging look!\u201d assented Kennedy;\n\u201cand they are rough, stalwart fellows.\u201d\n \n\u201cHappily those brutes can\u2019t fly,\u201d remarked Joe; \u201cand\nthat\u2019s something.\u201d\n \n\u201cSee,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201cthose villages in ruins, those huts\nburned down\u2014that is their work! Where vast stretches of cultivated land\nwere once seen, they have brought barrenness and devastation.\u201d\n \n\u201cAt all events, however,\u201d interposed Kennedy, \u201cthey\ncan\u2019t overtake us; and, if we succeed in putting the river between us and\nthem, we are safe.\u201d\n \n\u201cPerfectly, Dick,\u201d replied Ferguson; \u201cbut we must not fall to\nthe ground!\u201d and, as he said this, he glanced at the barometer.\n \n\u201cIn any case, Joe,\u201d added Kennedy, \u201cit would do us no harm to\nlook to our fire-arms.\u201d\n \n\u201cNo harm in the world, Mr. Dick! We are lucky that we didn\u2019t\nscatter them along the road.\u201d\n \n\u201cMy rifle!\u201d said the sportsman. \u201cI hope that I shall never be\nseparated from it!\u201d\n \nAnd so saying, Kennedy loaded the pet piece with the greatest care, for he had\nplenty of powder and ball remaining.\n \n\u201cAt what height are we?\u201d he asked the doctor.\n \n\u201cAbout seven hundred and fifty feet; but we no longer have the power of\nseeking favorable currents, either going up or coming down. We are at the mercy\nof the balloon!\u201d\n \n\u201cThat is vexatious!\u201d rejoined Kennedy. \u201cThe wind is poor; but\nif we had come across a hurricane like some of those we met before, these vile\nbrigands would have been out of sight long ago.\u201d\n \n\u201cThe rascals follow us at their leisure,\u201d said Joe.\n\u201cThey\u2019re only at a short gallop. Quite a nice little ride!\u201d\n \n\u201cIf we were within range,\u201d sighed the sportsman, \u201cI should\namuse myself with dismounting a few of them.\u201d\n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cbut then they would have you\nwithin range also, and our balloon would offer only too plain a target to the\nbullets from their long guns; and, if they were to make a hole in it, I leave\nyou to judge what our situation would be!\u201d\n \nThe pursuit of the Talabas continued all morning; and by eleven o\u2019clock\nthe a\u00ebronauts had made scarcely fifteen miles to the westward.\n \nThe doctor was anxiously watching for the least cloud on the horizon. He\nfeared, above all things, a change in the atmosphere. Should he be thrown back\ntoward the Niger, what would become of him? Besides, he remarked that the\nballoon tended to fall considerably. Since the start, he had already lost more\nthan three hundred feet, and the Senegal must be about a dozen miles distant.\nAt his present rate of speed, he could count upon travelling only three hours\nlonger.\n \nAt this moment his attention was attracted by fresh cries. The Talabas appeared\nto be much excited, and were spurring their horses.\n \nThe doctor consulted his barometer, and at once discovered the cause of these\nsymptoms.\n \n\u201cAre we descending?\u201d asked Kennedy.\n \n\u201cYes!\u201d replied the doctor.\n \n\u201cThe mischief!\u201d thought Joe\n \nIn the lapse of fifteen minutes the Victoria was only one hundred and\nfifty feet above the ground; but the wind was much stronger than before.\n \nThe Talabas checked their horses, and soon a volley of musketry pealed out on\nthe air.\n \n\u201cToo far, you fools!\u201d bawled Joe. \u201cI think it would be well\nto keep those scamps at a distance.\u201d\n \nAnd, as he spoke, he aimed at one of the horsemen who was farthest to the\nfront, and fired. The Talaba fell headlong, and, his companions halting for a\nmoment, the balloon gained upon them.\n \n\u201cThey are prudent!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cBecause they think that they are certain to take us,\u201d replied the\ndoctor; \u201cand, they will succeed if we descend much farther. We must,\nabsolutely, get higher into the air.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat can we throw out?\u201d asked Joe.\n \n\u201cAll that remains of our stock of pemmican; that will be thirty pounds\nless weight to carry.\u201d\n \n\u201cOut it goes, sir!\u201d said Joe, obeying orders.\n \nThe car, which was now almost touching the ground, rose again, amid the cries\nof the Talabas; but, half an hour later, the balloon was again falling rapidly,\nbecause the gas was escaping through the pores of the covering.\n \nEre long the car was once more grazing the soil, and Al-Hadji\u2019s black\nriders rushed toward it; but, as frequently happens in like cases, the balloon\nhad scarcely touched the surface ere it rebounded, and only came down again a\nmile away.\n \n\u201cSo we shall not escape!\u201d said Kennedy, between his teeth.\n \n\u201cThrow out our reserved store of brandy, Joe,\u201d cried the doctor;\n\u201cour instruments, and every thing that has any weight, even to our last\nanchor, because go they must!\u201d\n \nJoe flung out the barometers and thermometers, but all that amounted to little;\nand the balloon, which had risen for an instant, fell again toward the ground.\n \nThe Talabas flew toward it, and at length were not more than two hundred paces\naway.\n \n\u201cThrow out the two fowling-pieces!\u201d shouted Ferguson.\n \n\u201cNot without discharging them, at least,\u201d responded the sportsman;\nand four shots in quick succession struck the thick of the advancing group of\nhorsemen. Four Talabas fell, amid the frantic howls and imprecations of their\ncomrades.\n \nThe Victoria ascended once more, and made some enormous leaps, like a\nhuge gum-elastic ball, bounding and rebounding through the air. A strange sight\nit was to see these unfortunate men endeavoring to escape by those huge a\u00ebrial\nstrides, and seeming, like the giant Antaeus, to receive fresh strength every\ntime they touched the earth. But this situation had to terminate. It was now\nnearly noon; the Victoria was getting empty and exhausted, and assuming\na more and more elongated form every instant. Its outer covering was becoming\nflaccid, and floated loosely in the air, and the folds of the silk rustled and\ngrated on each other.\n \n\u201cHeaven abandons us!\u201d said Kennedy; \u201cwe have to fall!\u201d\n \nJoe made no answer. He kept looking intently at his master.\n \n\u201cNo!\u201d said the latter; \u201cwe have more than one hundred and\nfifty pounds yet to throw out.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat can it be, then?\u201d said Kennedy, thinking that the doctor must\nbe going mad.\n \n\u201cThe car!\u201d was his reply; \u201cwe can cling to the network. There\nwe can hang on in the meshes until we reach the river. Quick! quick!\u201d\n \nAnd these daring men did not hesitate a moment to avail themselves of this last\ndesperate means of escape. They clutched the network, as the doctor directed,\nand Joe, holding on by one hand, with the other cut the cords that suspended\nthe car; and the latter dropped to the ground just as the balloon was sinking\nfor the last time.\n \n\u201cHurrah! hurrah!\u201d shouted the brave fellow exultingly, as the\nVictoria, once more relieved, shot up again to a height of three hundred\nfeet.\n \nThe Talabas spurred their horses, which now came tearing on at a furious\ngallop; but the balloon, falling in with a much more favorable wind, shot ahead\nof them, and was rapidly carried toward a hill that stretched across the\nhorizon to the westward. This was a circumstance favorable to the a\u00ebronauts,\nbecause they could rise over the hill, while Al-Hadji\u2019s horde had to\ndiverge to the northward in order to pass this obstacle.\n \nThe three friends still clung to the network. They had been able to fasten it\nunder their feet, where it had formed a sort of swinging pocket.\n \nSuddenly, after they had crossed the hill, the doctor exclaimed: \u201cThe\nriver! the river! the Senegal, my friends!\u201d\n \nAnd about two miles ahead of them, there was indeed the river rolling along its\nbroad mass of water, while the farther bank, which was low and fertile, offered\na sure refuge, and a place favorable for a descent.\n \n\u201cAnother quarter of an hour,\u201d said Ferguson, \u201cand we are\nsaved!\u201d\n \nBut it was not to happen thus; the empty balloon descended slowly upon a tract\nalmost entirely bare of vegetation. It was made up of long slopes and stony\nplains, a few bushes and some coarse grass, scorched by the sun.\n \nThe Victoria touched the ground several times, and rose again, but her\nrebound was diminishing in height and length. At the last one, it caught by the\nupper part of the network in the lofty branches of a baobab, the only tree that\nstood there, solitary and alone, in the midst of the waste.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s all over,\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cAnd at a hundred paces only from the river!\u201d groaned Joe.\n \nThe three hapless a\u00ebronauts descended to the ground, and the doctor drew his\ncompanions toward the Senegal.\n \nAt this point the river sent forth a prolonged roaring; and when Ferguson\nreached its bank, he recognized the falls of Gouina. But not a boat, not a\nliving creature was to be seen. With a breadth of two thousand feet, the\nSenegal precipitates itself for a height of one hundred and fifty, with a\nthundering reverberation. It ran, where they saw it, from east to west, and the\nline of rocks that barred its course extended from north to south. In the midst\nof the falls, rocks of strange forms started up like huge ante-diluvian\nanimals, petrified there amid the waters.\n \nThe impossibility of crossing this gulf was self-evident, and Kennedy could not\nrestrain a gesture of despair.\n \nBut Dr. Ferguson, with an energetic accent of undaunted daring,\nexclaimed\u2014\n \n\u201cAll is not over!\u201d\n \n\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Joe, with that confidence in his master which\nnothing could ever shake.\n \nThe sight of the dried-up grass had inspired the doctor with a bold idea. It\nwas the last chance of escape. He led his friends quickly back to where they\nhad left the covering of the balloon.\n \n\u201cWe have at least an hour\u2019s start of those banditti,\u201d said\nhe; \u201clet us lose no time, my friends; gather a quantity of this dried\ngrass; I want a hundred pounds of it, at least.\u201d\n \n\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d asked Kennedy, surprised.\n \n\u201cI have no more gas; well, I\u2019ll cross the river with hot\nair!\u201d\n \n\u201cAh, doctor,\u201d exclaimed Kennedy, \u201cyou are, indeed, a great\nman!\u201d\n \nJoe and Kennedy at once went to work, and soon had an immense pile of dried\ngrass heaped up near the baobab.\n \nIn the mean time, the doctor had enlarged the orifice of the balloon by cutting\nit open at the lower end. He then was very careful to expel the last remnant of\nhydrogen through the valve, after which he heaped up a quantity of grass under\nthe balloon, and set fire to it.\n \nIt takes but a little while to inflate a balloon with hot air. A head of one\nhundred and eighty degrees is sufficient to diminish the weight of the air it\ncontains to the extent of one-half, by rarefying it. Thus, the Victoria\nquickly began to assume a more rounded form. There was no lack of grass; the\nfire was kept in full blast by the doctor\u2019s assiduous efforts, and the\nballoon grew fuller every instant.\n \nIt was then a quarter to four o\u2019clock.\n \nAt this moment the band of Talabas reappeared about two miles to the northward,\nand the three friends could hear their cries, and the clatter of their horses\ngalloping at full speed.\n \n\u201cIn twenty minutes they will be here!\u201d said Kennedy.\n \n\u201cMore grass! more grass, Joe! In ten minutes we shall have her full of\nhot air.\u201d\n \n\u201cHere it is, doctor!\u201d\n \nThe Victoria was now two-thirds inflated.\n \n\u201cCome, my friends, let us take hold of the network, as we did\nbefore.\u201d\n \n\u201cAll right!\u201d they answered together.\n \nIn about ten minutes a few jerking motions by the balloon indicated that it was\ndisposed to start again. The Talabas were approaching. They were hardly five\nhundred paces away.\n \n\u201cHold on fast!\u201d cried Ferguson.\n \n\u201cHave no fear, master\u2014have no fear!\u201d\n \nAnd the doctor, with his foot pushed another heap of grass upon the fire.\n \nWith this the balloon, now completely inflated by the increased temperature,\nmoved away, sweeping the branches of the baobab in her flight.\n \n\u201cWe\u2019re off!\u201d shouted Joe.\n \nA volley of musketry responded to his exclamation. A bullet even ploughed his\nshoulder; but Kennedy, leaning over, and discharging his rifle with one hand,\nbrought another of the enemy to the ground.\n \nCries of fury exceeding all description hailed the departure of the balloon,\nwhich had at once ascended nearly eight hundred feet. A swift current caught\nand swept it along with the most alarming oscillations, while the intrepid\ndoctor and his friends saw the gulf of the cataracts yawning below them.\n \nTen minutes later, and without having exchanged a word, they descended\ngradually toward the other bank of the river.\n \nThere, astonished, speechless, terrified, stood a group of men clad in the\nFrench uniform. Judge of their amazement when they saw the balloon rise from\nthe right bank of the river. They had well-nigh taken it for some celestial\nphenomenon, but their officers, a lieutenant of marines and a naval ensign,\nhaving seen mention made of Dr. Ferguson\u2019s daring expedition, in the\nEuropean papers, quickly explained the real state of the case.\n \nThe balloon, losing its inflation little by little, settled with the daring\ntravellers still clinging to its network; but it was doubtful whether it would\nreach the land. At once some of the brave Frenchmen rushed into the water and\ncaught the three a\u00ebronauts in their arms just as the Victoria fell at\nthe distance of a few fathoms from the left bank of the Senegal.\n \n\u201cDr. Ferguson!\u201d exclaimed the lieutenant.\n \n\u201cThe same, sir,\u201d replied the doctor, quietly, \u201cand his two\nfriends.\u201d\n \nThe Frenchmen escorted our travellers from the river, while the balloon,\nhalf-empty, and borne away by a swift current, sped on, to plunge, like a huge\nbubble, headlong with the waters of the Senegal, into the cataracts of Gouina.\n \n\u201cThe poor Victoria!\u201d was Joe\u2019s farewell remark.\n \nThe doctor could not restrain a tear, and extending his hands his two friends\nwrung them silently with that deep emotion which requires no spoken words.\n",
        "\n\nConclusion.\u2014The Certificate.\u2014The French Settlements.\u2014The Post\nof Medina.\u2014The Basilic.\u2014Saint Louis.\u2014The English\nFrigate.\u2014The Return to London.\n \nThe expedition upon the bank of the river had been sent by the governor of\nSenegal. It consisted of two officers, Messrs. Dufraisse, lieutenant of\nmarines, and Rodamel, naval ensign, and with these were a sergeant and seven\nsoldiers. For two days they had been engaged in reconnoitring the most\nfavorable situation for a post at Gouina, when they became witnesses of Dr.\nFerguson\u2019s arrival.\n \nThe warm greetings and felicitations of which our travellers were the\nrecipients may be imagined. The Frenchmen, and they alone, having had ocular\nproof of the accomplishment of the daring project, naturally became Dr.\nFerguson\u2019s witnesses. Hence the doctor at once asked them to give their\nofficial testimony of his arrival at the cataracts of Gouina.\n \n\u201cYou would have no objection to signing a certificate of the fact, would\nyou?\u201d he inquired of Lieutenant Dufraisse.\n \n\u201cAt your orders!\u201d the latter instantly replied.\n \nThe Englishmen were escorted to a provisional post established on the bank of\nthe river, where they found the most assiduous attention, and every thing to\nsupply their wants. And there the following certificate was drawn up in the\nterms in which it appears to-day, in the archives of the Royal Geographical\nSociety of London:\n \n\u201cWe, the undersigned, do hereby declare that, on the day herein\nmentioned, we witnessed the arrival of Dr. Ferguson and his two companions,\nRichard Kennedy and Joseph Wilson, clinging to the cordage and network of a\nballoon, and that the said balloon fell at a distance of a few paces from us\ninto the river, and being swept away by the current was lost in the cataracts\nof Gouina. In testimony whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals\nbeside those of the persons hereinabove named, for the information of all whom\nit may concern.\n \n\u201cDone at the Cataracts of Gouina, on the 24th of May, 1862.\n \n\n\u201c(Signed),\n\n\u201cSAMUEL FERGUSON\n\n\u201cRICHARD KENNEDY,\n\n\u201cJOSEPH WILSON,\n\n\u201cDUFRAISSE, Lieutenant of Marines,\n\n\u201cRODAMEL, Naval Ensign,\n\n\u201cDUFAYS, Sergeant,\n\n\u201cFLIPPEAU, MAYOR, PELISSIER, LOROIS, RASCAGNET, GUILLON, LEBEL,\nPrivates.\u201d\n \nHere ended the astonishing journey of Dr. Ferguson and his brave companions, as\nvouched for by undeniable testimony; and they found themselves among friends in\nthe midst of most hospitable tribes, whose relations with the French\nsettlements are frequent and amicable.\n \nThey had arrived at Senegal on Saturday, the 24th of May, and on the 27th of\nthe same month they reached the post of Medina, situated a little farther to\nthe north, but on the river.\n \nThere the French officers received them with open arms, and lavished upon them\nall the resources of their hospitality. Thus aided, the doctor and his friends\nwere enabled to embark almost immediately on the small steamer called the\nBasilic, which ran down to the mouth of the river.\n \nTwo weeks later, on the 10th of June, they arrived at Saint Louis, where the\ngovernor gave them a magnificent reception, and they recovered completely from\ntheir excitement and fatigue.\n \nBesides, Joe said to every one who chose to listen:\n \n\u201cThat was a stupid trip of ours, after all, and I wouldn\u2019t advise\nany body who is greedy for excitement to undertake it. It gets very tiresome at\nthe last, and if it hadn\u2019t been for the adventures on Lake Tchad and at\nthe Senegal River, I do believe that we\u2019d have died of yawning.\u201d\n \nAn English frigate was just about to sail, and the three travellers procured\npassage on board of her. On the 25th of June they arrived at Portsmouth, and on\nthe next day at London.\n \nWe will not describe the reception they got from the Royal Geographical\nSociety, nor the intense curiosity and consideration of which they became the\nobjects. Kennedy set off, at once, for Edinburgh, with his famous rifle, for he\nwas in haste to relieve the anxiety of his faithful old housekeeper.\n \nThe doctor and his devoted Joe remained the same men that we have known them,\nexcepting that one change took place at their own suggestion.\n \nThey ceased to be master and servant, in order to become bosom friends.\n \nThe journals of all Europe were untiring in their praises of the bold\nexplorers, and the Daily Telegraph struck off an edition of three\nhundred and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a sketch\nof the trip.\n \nDoctor Ferguson, at a public meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, gave a\nrecital of his journey through the air, and obtained for himself and his\ncompanions the golden medal set apart to reward the most remarkable exploring\nexpedition of the year 1862.\n \nThe first result of Dr. Ferguson\u2019s expedition was to establish, in the\nmost precise manner, the facts and geographical surveys reported by Messrs.\nBarth, Burton, Speke, and others. Thanks to the still more recent expeditions\nof Messrs. Speke and Grant, De Heuglin and Muntzinger, who have been ascending\nto the sources of the Nile, and penetrating to the centre of Africa, we shall\nbe enabled ere long to verify, in turn, the discoveries of Dr. Ferguson in that\nvast region comprised between the fourteenth and thirty-third degrees of east\nlongitude.\n"
