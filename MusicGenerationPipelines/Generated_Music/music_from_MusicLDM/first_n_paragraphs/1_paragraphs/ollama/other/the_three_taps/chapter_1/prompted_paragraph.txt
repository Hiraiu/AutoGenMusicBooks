The principles of insurance, they tell us, were
not hidden from our Anglo-Saxon forefathers.
How anybody had the enterprise in
those rough-and-tumble days to guarantee a client
against “fire, water, robbery or other calamity”
remains a problem for the historian; the more so as it
appears that mathematical calculations were first
applied to the business by the eminent John de Witt.
In our own time, at any rate, the insurance
companies have woven a golden net under the tight-rope
walk of existence; if life is a lottery, the prudent
citizen faces it with the consciousness that he is backed
both ways. Had the idea been thoroughly grasped in
those remoter periods, no doubt but Alfred’s hostess
would have been easily consoled for the damage done
to her cakes and King John handsomely compensated
for all that he lost in The Wash. Let us thank
the soaring genius of the human mind which has thus
found a means to canalize for us the waters of
affliction; and let us always be scrupulous in paying up
our premiums before the date indicated on the
printed card, lest calamity should come upon us and
find us unprepared.
