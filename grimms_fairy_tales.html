            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 1:</b> A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A lively mix of folk instruments, such as flutes, fiddles, and accordions, with a jaunty rhythm and cheerful melody that captures the sense of adventure and triumph in this classic fairy tale.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 2:</b> Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right—all that falls to them is so much gain—all their geese are swans—all their cards are trumps—toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it know about the matter?</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A jaunty melody with a lively tempo, featuring cheerful harmonies and a playful rhythm that evokes a sense of joy and abandon.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 3:</b> There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A haunting melody of longing and despair, with soaring nightingale refrains and mournful jug-ug harmonies, set against a backdrop of twilight woods and crumbling castle walls. </p>

            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 4:</b> An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 5:</b> A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A lively, whimsical tune plays in the key of E minor, featuring a lilting melody that evokes a sense of rustic charm. The tempo is moderate, with a subtle waltz-like rhythm that adds to the overall air of playfulness and mischief.</p>
