            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 1:</b> There was a large audience assembled on the 14th of January, 1862, at the session of the Royal Geographical Society, No. 3 Waterloo Place, London. The president, Sir Francis M——, made an important communication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently interrupted by applause.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 2:</b>On the next day, in its number of January 15th, the Daily Telegraph published an article couched in the following terms: “Africa is, at length, about to surrender the secret of her vast solitudes; a modern Œdipus is to give us the key to that enigma which the learned men of sixty centuries have not been able to decipher. In other days, to seek the sources of the Nile—fontes Nili quærere—was regarded as a mad endeavor, a chimera that could not be realized. </p>

            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 3:</b> Dr. Ferguson had a friend—not another self, indeed, an alter ego, for friendship could not exist between two beings exactly alike. But, if they possessed different qualities, aptitudes, and temperaments, Dick Kennedy and Samuel Ferguson lived with one and the same heart, and that gave them no great trouble. In fact, quite the reverse.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> Airy, elegant waltzes and lively, classical orchestral pieces fill the room with sophistication and refinement.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 4:</b> The aërial line which Dr. Ferguson counted upon following had not been chosen at random; his point of departure had been carefully studied, and it was not without good cause that he had resolved to ascend at the island of Zanzibar. This island, lying near to the eastern coast of Africa, is in the sixth degree of south latitude, that is to say, four hundred and thirty geographical miles below the equator.</p>

            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 5:</b> Dr. Ferguson energetically pushed the preparations for his departure, and in person superintended the construction of his balloon, with certain modifications; in regard to which he observed the most absolute silence. For a long time past he had been applying himself to the study of the Arab language and the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to his talents as a polyglot, he had made rapid progress.</p>
