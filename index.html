            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 1:</b> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A gentle, soothing melody unfolds with subtle harmonies and soft instrumental textures.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 2:</b> Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A whimsical waltz of wonder and fantasy unfolds, with soaring melodies and playful rhythms that transport listeners to a world of curiosity and enchantment.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 3:</b> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 4:</b> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A whimsical waltz of wonder unfolds, with delicate notes dancing like anxious whiskers, searching for a lost thread of sanity.</p>
