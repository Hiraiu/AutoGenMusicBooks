            <h2>Tarzan- Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>Teeka, stretched at luxurious ease in the shade of the tropical forest, presented, unquestionably, a most alluring picture of young, feminine loveliness. Or at least so thought Tarzan of the Apes, who squatted upon a low-swinging branch in a near-by tree and looked down upon her.</p>
            <p>Ollama prompt: A lilting melody with gentle strings and soft percussion whispers sweet nothings to the senses.</p>

            <h2>Tarzan- Chapter 2</h2>
            <p>The black warriors labored in the humid heat of the jungle’s stifling shade. With war spears they loosened the thick, black loam and the deep layers of rotting vegetation. With heavy-nailed fingers they scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center of the age-old game trail. Often they ceased their labors to squat, resting and gossiping, with much laughter, at the edge of the pit they were digging.</p>
            <p>Ollama prompt: A primal rhythm pulsates through the air, a driving beat that echoes the ancient heartbeat of the jungle itself. </p>

            <h2>Tarzan - Chapter 3</h2>
            <p>Teeka had become a mother. Tarzan of the Apes was intensely interested, much more so, in fact, than Taug, the father. Tarzan was very fond of Teeka. Even the cares of prospective motherhood had not entirely quenched the fires of carefree youth, and Teeka had remained a good-natured playmate even at an age when other shes of the tribe of Kerchak had assumed the sullen dignity of maturity. She yet retained her childish delight in the primitive games of tag and hide-and-go-seek which Tarzan’s fertile man-mind had evolved.</p>
            <p>Ollama prompt: A lively, playful melody with a hint of wild abandon and youthful energy.</p>
