            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 1:</b> As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm. If you persist, lawyersâ€™ clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady typists will have to fidget behind you. In the streets of London where beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the air with your left hand.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A lively, quirky tune with playful rhythms and whimsical melodies that evoke the sense of navigating a bustling city's streets.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 2:</b>Uncomfortable as the night, with its rocking movement, and salt smells, may have been, and in one case undoubtedly was, for Mr. Pepper had insufficient clothes upon his bed, the breakfast next morning wore a kind of beauty. The voyage had begun, and had begun happily with a soft blue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped resources, things to say as yet unsaid, made the hour significant, so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene, with the sound of sirens hooting in the river the night before, somehow mixing in. </p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A gentle melody floats on a bed of soothing harmonies, accompanied by the soft lapping of waves against a serene shore.</p>

            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 3:</b> Early next morning there was a sound as of chains being drawn roughly overhead; the steady heart of the Euphrosyne slowly ceased to beat; and Helen, poking her nose above deck, saw a stationary castle upon a stationary hill. They had dropped anchor in the mouth of the Tagus, and instead of cleaving new waves perpetually, the same waves kept returning and washing against the sides of the ship.</p>

            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 4:</b> Next morning Clarissa was up before anyone else. She dressed, and was out on deck, breathing the fresh air of a calm morning, and, making the circuit of the ship for the second time, she ran straight into the lean person of Mr. Grice, the steward. She apologised, and at the same time asked him to enlighten her: what were those shiny brass stands for, half glass on the top? She had been wondering, and could not guess. When he had done explaining, she cried enthusiastically:</p>
