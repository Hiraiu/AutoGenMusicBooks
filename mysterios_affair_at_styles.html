            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 1:</b> The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “The Styles Case” has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A melancholic melody whispers secrets in a hushed tone, its gentle harmony soothing the tumultuous air.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 2:</b> I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations.</p>
            <p><b>Ollama prompt:</b> A languid, old-world melody floats effortlessly on a bed of soft brass, punctuated by the occasional, mournful piano chord.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
            <p><b>The first paragraph of Chapter 4:</b> The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his absence?</p>
